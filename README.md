# Broadmoor Sermon Transcriptions 
The following archive are the transcriptions of sermons since 2008. Much of this data is part of an NLP project and will provide an interesting set of data that can be useful for a number of different reasons. 

For one, the written word is much easier to digest than the spoken word can sometimes be easily translated. 

 The following will be done: 

* Create an entity recognition around passages of scriptures in order to further understand what has been covered and what hasn't been. 

* Understand concepts and patterns over time, some of that will depend on how one might have taught or might have brought insight. 

This will be an interesting learning project as well.
