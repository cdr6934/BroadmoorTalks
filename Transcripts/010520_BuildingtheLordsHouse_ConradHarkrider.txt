Good morning, if you would open up your Bibles to Exodus, the 35th chapter Exodus 35.

Conrad Harkrider  00:26
Today is the first Sunday of the month, it's also the first Sunday of the year and the first Sunday of the decade. You don't get to say that very often. But this is a time of year when people are thinking about goals and resolutions and their direction for the upcoming year. And my family and I, we were talking about some of our New Year's resolutions, and we involve the kids in that discussion asking them, What do you think we should do and some of the ideas that we came up with the things that we set for ourselves were pretty good, I wanted to share a few of those with you. The first thing was, we wanted to try and show appreciation to some of the servants or people in our community like the first responders. And so someone suggested making cookies and taking it to the fire station, I thought that was a good idea. We also came up with being more in touch with our family that live in other places try to make an effort to call them more frequently and keep those relationships intact. And then one of the kids suggested that we offer to let people who don't have a place to live come and stay at our house, that one is still under review by mom and dad might have a slight revision to the final gold before we put it in place. But this is a time of year when we're thinking about our, our direction, it's often a time when you could start a new project, you could pick up a habit that maybe has dropped off or set to the side. And it's also a good time for us to be thinking about our service and our commitment to the Lord, our commitment to other Christians to the church, and to those who are in the body of Christ. And this morning, I'd like for us to look at a passage from Exodus 35. That really speaks to a new beginning for God's people after what they had been through, and then they find themselves here at this moment. It is a turning point, it's a new start for them. And we'll use this text to think about the type of house that God wants us to build today. The the way that we work together in the body of Christ, so read with me and Exodus 35, as we think about building the Lord's house, building the Lord's house. Let's start in verse four, Exodus 35 And verse four.

Conrad Harkrider  03:08
It says, And Moses spoke to all the congregation of the children of Israel saying, this is the thing which the Lord commanded, saying, Take from among you and offering to the Lord, who has whoever is of a willing heart, let him bring as an offering to the Lord. skip down to verse 20. And all the congregation of the children of Israel departed from the presence of Moses. Then everyone came whose heart was stirred and everyone whose spirit was willing, and they brought the Lord's offering for the work of the tabernacle of meeting, for all its service and for the holy garments. They came both men and women, as many as had a willing heart and brought earrings and nose rings and rings, necklaces, all jewelry of gold, that is every man who made an offering of gold to the Lord, and every man with whom was found blue, purple and scarlet thread, fine linen and goat's hair Redskins have rams and badger skins brought them. Everyone who offered an offering of silver or bronze brought the Lord's offering. And every everyone with whom was found acacia wood for any work of the service brought it all the women who were gifted artisans spun yarn with their hands and brought what they had spun of blue, purple and scarlet and fine linen, and all the women whose hearts stirred with wisdom spun yarns of goat's hair, the rulers brought onyx stones and the stones to be set in the fog, and in the breastplate, and the spices and oil for the light for the anointing oil and for the sweet incense. The children of Israel brought a Free Will offering to the Lord all the men and women whose hearts were willing to bring material for all kinds of work which the Lord by the hand of Moses had commanded to be done. There's a call that goes out by Moses and by the Lord to bring these materials to make preparation for building this dwelling place this tabernacle, for God. And as we just read in detail, the people start bringing various items to be used in building this special house. But before we think about what's happening here in Exodus 35, I want you to take your mind back to the preceding events, and go all the way back to Exodus chapter 19, as Moses and the people come to Mount Sinai, and Moses goes up onto that mountain that was covered in fire and smoke, to receive the 10 commandments, but not just the the giving of the commandments, but he also receives various instructions that the people are to follow how they're supposed to live their lives the way that they're supposed to worship God. And then he receives receives very detailed instructions about the construction of the tabernacle, this dwelling place for God. And it says, In Exodus, chapter 29, and verse 42, it shall be a regular bird offering throughout your generations at the entrance of the tent of meeting before the Lord, where I will meet with you to speak to you there, there, I will meet with the people of Israel, and it shall be sanctified by my glory. So God tells Moses, that this tabernacle, this tent, is not just going to be a place to keep precious artifacts from the nation, but rather, this would be the place where God comes to meet with his people, this would be the dwelling place of God, the Lord would be in their midst. Before this time, Moses would just pitch a tent outside of the camp. And he would call it the Tent of Meeting and the people would come out to him and there, they would inquire of the Lord. But now God is going to formally set up a place where His presence and His name will dwell, this is incredible, that God is giving a nation like Israel, this opportunity to be in this close relationship with Him. Well, as Moses is up there on the mountain, and he's receiving the instruction, you remember what happened back down in the camp, that people start to get restless. And they wonder what has happened to Moses and if he's ever going to return and so they pressure Aaron, to make for them a god and Aaron fashions, this idol out of their gold, he brings out the golden calf and they bow down to it and they worship it. And as Moses is coming down the mountain and he sees the this act of rebellion, this unfaithfulness that the people have engaged in, he literally breaks the covenant, he throws down the tablets of stone and he breaks them into pieces.

Conrad Harkrider  08:04
God would ultimately punish the people for these actions. And in chapter 33 of Exodus, God tells Moses that he wants him to go up into the land, but that his presence is not going to go with them. Because this is a as he says, a stiff neck and stubborn people. God says you go ahead and go up. But I am not going to be with you. This was God's way of withdrawing himself from the people. This once promising relationship has now been destroyed because of their selfishness and unfaithfulness. Of course, that's not where the story ends. God doesn't just leave his people to die there. But in chapter 34, Moses goes and intercedes on behalf of the people. And he pleads with God. And the Lord makes this amazing statement about his character and his nature. He says that he is merciful and gracious, and abounding in steadfast love. God is a God of second chances. And so he offers mercy to His people and He remakes those tablets that were crushed, any forms a new covenant with them, and he restores the people. And so here in chapter 35, after their rebellion, and after going and bowing down to this foreign God, the Lord has now invited his people to again come into His presence and participate in building a house, a dwelling place, the tabernacle where the presence of God is going to rest. Let's notice in verse 22, as the preparations start to be made 35 Verse 22. It says they came both men and women, as many as had a willing heart and brought earrings and nose rings and rings and necklaces, all jewelry of gold. That is every man who made an offering have gold to the Lord there was notice both men and women. And the first thing we can see here is when building the Lord's house, there was participation from all. This was a total group effort. There wasn't just a single tribe among the people, it wasn't a certain class of people. Notice in verse 27, it says, The rulers brought precious stones to be set inside the breastplate that Aaron and his sons would wear. This was both the common people as well as the wealthy the men of war, and the wives who stayed back, they all came together to contribute to this important work. And it's no different today, when we think about building God's Kingdom building his church. In our time, the Lord wants each of us to have a part to take a share. In that work, the body of Christ is made up of many different members. And that's by God's design. I saw a commercial recently was advertising a cruise liner. And they had a depiction of all the various excursions that you could take and all the exciting things that you could do while you're on this ship. And towards the end of the advertisement down in big, bold letters at the bottom of the screen, it said, no kids allowed. And I quickly told my wife to write down the name of that cruise liner. But that's what a lot of people want. They want a vacation that is free from from kids free from noise.

Conrad Harkrider  11:43
Wouldn't it be great if there was a church that said no, loud or small children? When that make the prayers a lot quieter, easier to focus and to listen? Or what about a church that just said only young families must have children to be a part, or how about only under 40, or, or maybe 45? Let's raise it up a little bit. But we you put it in those terms, it sounds ridiculous. But yet, that's how many people act or, or at least that's the way they conduct themselves. The way that they treat other people, it's as if they would only want a certain demographic to be a part of the church. But that's not what the body of Christ looks like. It's made up of all different kinds of people. It's made up of older members, people who have lived through life. They've gone through the struggles and the difficulties of living in this world, and yet they have remained faithful and committed to the Lord. It's made up of young people who have left their parents home. And now they have continued to commit themselves to the Lord just as King Josiah did. It's made up of families, it's made of those who are married single divorce people from different levels of education, or wealth with all different races and various backgrounds, and they are united together as one in Christ. And as that diverse group of people comes together, the Lord wants participation. He wants contribution from each and every person. It's one of the reasons why we when we sing as a group, we encourage every person to join in. Whether you're 90 or nine years old, whether you have a very talented and wonderful voice or you can't sing at all. The Lord wants to hear you praise him. No matter what stage you are in life, or where you find yourself. The Lord wants you to know that you're an important part of the body of Christ, Paul said that those members that we seem to think are weaker, or not as desirable. He said that they are indispensable. And so even though you may not be visible, or maybe you've never had a official role or been up in front of the congregation, or taught one of the classes, you are a vital part of this group. Participation is really about finding a role to play in the body of Christ and the starting point for that, for us to work together to develop a relationship. To keep one another accountable, is to become part of a local congregation, to identify yourself with a group of Christians and Acts chapter. In Acts chapter 11, in verse 25, Acts chapter 11 And verse 25, when Paul and Barnabas come and join themselves, to the church in Antioch. It says in Acts 11 In verse 25

Conrad Harkrider  15:04
It says then Barnabas departed for Tarsus to seek Saul. And when he had found him he brought him to Antioch. So it was that for a whole year, they assembled with the church and taught a great many people. And the disciples were first called Christians in Antioch. Paul and Barnabas come and join themselves together to the church in Antioch, there is this association that they have with the group, there is a shared or common purpose, they are all striving together to achieve the same goal. And so it is today the Lord wants His people wherever they live to join themselves to a group of Christians. We at Broadmoor want you to be a member of a local congregation. And in simple terms, what that means is that you are committed to helping this group. And this group is committed to helping you the work of the Lord is too great and too important not to have all hands on deck not to all be striving and working towards the same goal when they built the house, the tabernacle for the Lord, we see a participation from both men and women coming together to do this great work. Also, notice verse 29, Exodus 35 And verse 29. It says, The children of Israel brought a Free Will offering to the Lord, all the men and women whose hearts were willing to bring material for all kinds of work which the Lord, by the hand of Moses had commanded to be done. There were many different people that came and contributed and participated in this giving, but there was something that they had in common, those who were building the Lord's heart, the Lord's house, they came with a willing heart. First 29 says that they brought a free will, offering that their hearts were willing their hearts, verse 21, it says that their hearts were stirred within them.

Conrad Harkrider  17:18
And they didn't come. Moses didn't force these people to come and made make an offering. He lays the need before them, he shows them, what needs to be done, what it is that they're going to try to accomplish the task at hand and the people freely and eagerly bring their gifts. This wasn't done out of fear or obligation. But there was this sense of joy, a sense of, of gratitude that God had spared them from the incident prior, and now he's allowing them to be a part of this great opportunity. There are other examples in the scriptures, where people brought an offering to the Lord. And they willingly brought these things you remember in second, in First Chronicles 29, as David is making preparations for the temple, that Solomon, his son is going to build that all the people are bringing their offerings, and laying them before the king enjoy ashes day, the temple had to be repaired. And so he called, he put the chest out and made a hole in the top and he asked for contributions to be made. And the people willingly brought these things. In the time of Ezra and Ezra chapter three, as the people returned from exile, there's this great effort and contributions are made so that they can rebuild the temple of the Lord. And then in Acts chapter four, as the early churches, first starting, people are selling possessions, they're selling their land, and they're freely bringing these things and offering them to the Christians who were in need. These people understood that this was a momentous occasion, they realize that this was a privilege a blessing to be a part and be able to share in this. When I went to school, there was a brick pathway along the campus. And it was called the walk of champions. And what they allowed us if you are a current student at the school, you or mom and dad could pay a certain amount of money to have your name inscribed on one of those bricks. And you could put a short quote or phrase on there as well, but it would be there forever. Not forever, necessarily, but it would be there for a long time, it would be your little contribution to that walkway, so that you could be remembered. Think about if you were living during this time, and you had a piece of gold in your house, maybe it was something that had been passed down something that was in the family for a long time you had the opportunity to give that as a comment. attribution for the making of God's dwelling place, that that gold would be melted down and use to cover the Ark of the Covenant, it would be the place where God's presence would come to dwell is that something you'd want to be a part of? Is that something you'd be eager and willing to offer up? You see, when we fully appreciate what God has placed in front of us, when we understand what we have been allowed to participate in, then that produces a heart that is eager, that is ready and willing. And that's ultimately what God wants. God is interested in our hearts. When we come to worship God, it's not necessarily about the how well the music sounds. It's not about the eloquent words that are said in the prayers. It's not about giving so that others will see or know that we've contributed. but rather God is concerned with our heart, where is our heart. God doesn't want us just to be here. He's not taking attendance. But instead, he's looking for those who are hungering and thirsting after righteousness who are diligently seeking Him in His presence. They came to make their offering with a willing heart will also notice when building the Lord's house, they didn't all bring the same items in verse 23, verse 23, it says every man with whom was found blue, purple, scarlet thread, fine linen, goats, hair, red skins of RAM and badger skins, they brought them everyone who offered an offering of silver or bronze brought the Lord's offering, and everyone with whom was found acacia wood for any work of the service brought it. Notice that as they are making preparations to build this house, there's a variety of contributions. There is a number of different things that are abroad, there are earrings and bracelets, and nose rings, and all kinds of fine garments and threads. Remember that the last time that they were making offerings of gold, it was so that Aaron could fashion a golden calf, but now the people have directed their hearts to the right place is not for selfish motivation or reasons but they are freely and willingly giving these things. They brought silver and bronze. These were things that would be used for the furnishings. In the tabernacle, there were precious stones that would be placed on the breastplate that Aaron and his sons would wear. Some even brought oil and spices to be used in the instance, in verse 25. It says that the women who were skilled who had the ability to spin they made this fine linen. And so is there's this diversity of gifts and contributions that are made. When we think about our work and our relationship to the church and to God's people. Today, it's important for us to think about finding our place, finding our place, and to realize that there is not one single type of work that needs to be done. There's not one single contribution that God is looking for. There are a number of functions and roles in the body of Christ. Today, some of them are more formal. We think about shepherds and deacons, and evangelists and preachers and those who teach and those things are important. We need young men who are learning to stand up and to lead and to serve in those various capacities. But they're also roles that are less defined, but are still vital, things like encouraging others, taking the time to help someone else.

Conrad Harkrider  24:00
Those who write cards, those who check in those who call someone just to listen, to let them share what's on their heart, those who mentor and provide counsel. When Jessica and I got engaged, there was a man at the congregation where we were attending and he invited me to go out to lunch one afternoon, he said, I want to tell you a few things. I want to share some things about marriage with you. And I'll be honest with you, I had absolutely no idea what he was about to tell me. I think I was more nervous for that lunch than I was to get down on one knee and pop the question, but it ended up being something that was nothing formal. He just He took me to lunch and he said I want to share with you some things that I have learned from being married to my wife. Some things that I think have helped me and then some things that I think that I tried to avoid things that are sort of pitfalls. He told me that It's important that if you stay out somewhere that you check in that you call you consider the other person, think about them, you're not just living for yourself anymore. That brother and his wife, I don't think even came to our wedding. I don't remember what gift they got us. But what sticks with me today is that he took the time to share that wisdom. And that perspective, there are so many different ways that we can contribute to the work of the Lord taking interest in a young person, or taking interest or showing concern for an older member. Those are just a few of the ways. And this is not just something that is, you know, a certain group of people can only do one set of these things. This is for all ages, even our young children, there's opportunities for them to participate in the work. So I'm talking to the younger ones now. But what are some of the things that you can do to help in the work of the church? I was coming up with some ideas? How about picking up those little pieces of paper that always seem to be in between the pews, after our services? Or what about not leaving behind pieces of trash from gum and candy and other things? Or how about taking the mail from the office and delivering it to somebody when it starts getting backed up? Or what about writing a thank you note or a card to one of our song leaders telling them what a great job they've done? Or how about going and saying hi to a visitor? Or what about giving an older lady a hug without expecting a piece of candy? We love Miss Betty's candy. As parents, when we're teaching our kids to be servants. That's not something that starts when they're teenagers, and has to be taught from the time when they're very young. And each one of us needs to be thinking, what where's my place? How can I contribute to the work of the church? It's also important for us to fight against selfishness. We all can start to feel like what what's in it for me, what am I getting out of the service? What am I getting from this group? How is this benefiting me? In his inaugural address, JFK famously said Ask not what you can do. Ask not what your country can do for you ask what you can do for your country. And maybe that's a helpful way to think about our relationship to the Lord's body. Instead of asking, What does the church do for me, our focus should be on how can we give and support and help others in the body of Christ. This can be as simple as making an effort to talk to people that are new faces that are unfamiliar, or reaching out to people that are outside of our close group of friends, people that are just like us, you know, when we're focused on ourselves, we do what makes us feel good, we do what we enjoy doing. But when we're focused on the Lord's work, that causes us to go outside of our comfort zone to step out, for the benefit of others. In Philippians, chapter two and verse four. It says, let each of you look not only to his own interests, but also the interest of others. Finally, when building the Lord's house, all of this should be done to the glory of God. In verse 21, he says that they brought the Lord's offering in verse 24, he repeats this, he says, Everyone who offered an offering of silver or bronze brought the Lord's offering. This was the Lord's offering. It was the Lord's contribution. All of this was being done in honor of the Lord to the praise and glory of the Lord. The tabernacle was not being constructed.

Conrad Harkrider  29:05
To highlight the skill of these artisans. It wasn't to put their ability on display so that everyone would remember and be able to see. But rather everyone was working and contributing in order to build something for the Lord so that his presence could dwell among them. In the same way the church is not something that we should take pride in, that we should lay claim to that we should pat ourselves on the back or feel good about trying to take the credit or the honor, for any work or good that is done. But rather it's to the praise and glory of God. Any good that we might accomplish. Any person that we might help any brother or sister that we might encourage and strengthen and build up. It's not to our benefit or glory but to the glory of God. In June chapter one and verse 25, it says to the only God our Savior, through Jesus Christ, our Lord, the glory, majesty, dominion and authority, before all time, and now and forever. Amen. That's what it's all about all of our work. And our effort is centered on giving praise and honor to the one who deserves all glory and majesty, and dominion. Our time here on Earth is so short. That's one thing that is probably helpful for us to reflect on at the beginning of a new year, is to think about how quickly time passes, how short our life is, how fast a period of 12 months goes by, and the fact that it is a blessing, to be here to have life and health. And whatever opportunity or strength God has given to us. We've been given the ability to participate in the greatest building project in all of human history, to share the gospel, the good news about Jesus Christ with the whole world and to strengthen brothers and sisters, in their faith in service with the Lord. Let me ask and close with this question. Are you ready to come and work 2020 is going to be a great year, but we need all hands on deck. Why not make the decision to be an active part of our efforts. This next year? We're going to close with a song to encourage all who are here. There's something that we can do to help you in your walk with the Lord to pray for you to encourage you. You can use this opportunity now come down to the front as together we stand and seeing
