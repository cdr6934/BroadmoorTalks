Good evening. It's good to see everyone here tonight. Certainly good that we can gather together and worship our God. I'm sure you're aware, it's the new year. As Conrad mentioned, the New Year means new resolutions. It's only natural that as the year turns, we think about new things, we think about how we can improve ourselves. fact it's a common practice in our country to make New Year's resolutions. It's also a common practice in our country to practice them for three weeks and then then give up on Well, tonight, we are going to talk about New Year's resolutions. Looks like my thought resolution didn't turn out. Alright, New Year's resolutions. Goals for the Christian are good and unnecessary thing Christians need to make goals. We all have a singular goal is a Christian really of reaching heaven. And we see this goal from Paul in Philippians chapter two, in Philippians, chapter two verses 13. And 14 says but one thing I do forgetting what lies behind and straining forward to what lies ahead, I press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus. All right, David's in the background. He was working it so I didn't know whether to turn or not. He fixes things. And you don't even know. I can see up here my screen was different than what was up here. So I didn't know whether to turn or not. All right, thank you, David. He takes care of us. Philippians two, so Paul says that he leaves behind that which is in the past, and he reaches forward for the goal, the ultimate goal for the Christian is heaven. So every Christian makes a goal. Don't think every Christian has the goal of getting to heaven. That's what we all want to do. But even when we make goals, we need to remember what I mean. So say this, that that is our main goal as a Christian, but every other goal that we make, whether it be related to our physical lives or spiritual if you want to separate those even, and every other goal that we make sure it supports that one main goal of getting to heaven. So often the goals in our life relate to the common goals, losing weight, exercising, more managing money, those kinds of things, and even our physical health and financial means should be used in fruitful service to God. So it's not bad or negative to deal with the physical things of life. But I would say that we need to have every goal supporting that main goal of getting to heaven. We notice in Second Timothy chapter four, verses seven and eight, that even when we we realize that it's not bad to make goals related to our physical body, but spiritual goals and our spiritual well being is really the most important thing. In First Timothy four, Paul says, Have nothing to do with irreverence, silly myths. Rather, train yourself for godliness. For while bodily training is of some value. godliness is a value in every way, as it holds promise for the present life and also for the life to come. So it's not bad to make physical goals. But the most important thing is our spiritual well being our faith, and what we do with God. So I went online, and this is probably not news to you. But I noticed the the top resolutions and it's probably like this every year, they said this is 2020s. Top resolutions and even has a percentage based upon the people making that resolution 50 50% want to exercise more,

save money, eat more healthfully, healthily, lose weight, reduce stress. So those are five of the top goals. And I thought, well, that's really not a bad thing for us to consider tonight. So what are resolutions that we could make? What are some things that we could do? Well, first of all, we need to exercise more. We need to exercise more. Yes, physical exercise, as we've already mentioned, can be of some benefit. But exercising your faith has an even greater benefit. And we need to be constant in our exercising of our faith. Exercising Our faith must be a daily practice. And it's only through that daily practice that day in and day out of exercising our faith that we grow to maturity And Hebrews five and verse 14. There the writer says, But solid food is for the mature for those who have their powers of discernment trained by constant practice to distinguish good from evil. How do you grow as a Christian? You may see a mature Christian say, I would like to be like that. How can I get there? Well, I'll tell you how you get there. You get there by the daily constant practice of considering what is right and wrong and choosing the rights. And you do that daily, continually. Hebrews 12 also talks about the fact that our goal of getting to heaven is like running a race. And Hebrews 12 And verse one, there had mentioned this long distance race, let us run with endurance, the race that is set before us. Yes, we need to be exercising, and we need to be exercising our faith. Not only that, but Philippians two, verse 12 says, where to work out, work out, it says your salvation with fear and trembling. Working out your salvation, again, deals with the daily practice of your faith, so that you can be say, saved one day. And so we see the need for exercising more Christians need to exercise more. Secondly, we need to manage money better. Christians need to manage their money. Well, the point of that is not so much so that we can simply be wealthy or have a lot of money. But the point of the goal is so that we might glorify God even in our money, and that we might help others again, so that God might be glorified. Managing money also begins by realizing its proper place. And Hebrews 13 in verse five, fastest says, Keep your life free from love of money, and be content with what you have. Money should not consume us, it should not be the goal in life, we need to recognize its place, money is needed in this life to buy the necessities and carry on with with daily practices. But money should not consume us. We should be a content people, a content people Ephesians four also tells us that our money should be used. And first of all, it should be gotten in an honest way. And then it should be used in the helping of others. There it says let the thief no longer steal, but rather let him labor doing honest work with his own hands so that he may have something to share with anyone in need. Money is not something that Christian forwards or simply keeps to himself, but it's something that he uses to glorify God and helping of others. So yes, Christians need to manage their money, and they need to do that so that they can give glory to God.

Third, I would suggest that Christians need to eat better, we need a better diet. A good diet of food can be helpful and important. But a steady, regular diet of God's word is vital and necessary. When Jesus was tempted in the wilderness with with food of turning the rocks, the stones into bread, he replied with this statement, it is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of God. True Life. True vitality comes from God and from his word. And we need a steady diet of God's word. It can build us up and encourage us. Again, it helps us grow in our maturity. It keeps in mind the things that we need as we live this life. You know, we're forgetful creatures, we forget so often and so easily. We forget what we're supposed to be doing. We forget the reality that God reigns overall, we look out at the world we said sin is rampant this person seems to be winning in life seems to be accomplishing great things. And we simply forget the grand scheme of what the Bible shows us. God reigns and he will bring all things into account. We need God's Word in our life. Psalm 19 says that it is sweeter also than honey, the drippings of the honeycomb. We need God's word it sweets, and we need that diets. A failure to regularly feast upon God upon God's word can lead to malnutrition. If a parent did not feed their child, we would we would call services on them but that child needs to be fed. If a person was not eating We would call we would call somebody that person needs help. Christians also need to be eating from God's word feasting from it. Hebrews five and verse 12 says, For though by this time you ought to be teachers, you need someone to teach you again, the basic principles of the oracles of God, you need milk, not solid food. For everyone who lives on milk is unskilled and the word of righteousness. Since he is a child, it would make sense that as we grow, we take on a richer diet, more diverse diet, a diet of not just milk, but also including meat and other things like that. So here he says that we should be growing and eating accordingly. And not just those that are like babes or children that would live on milk. So let us eat better this year, eat better from God's word, and keep on a steady diet of God's Word.

Fourth, we need to lose weight, we need to lose weight. Now, I'm not going to talk to anybody about their body image or the pounds that come off. But I do want to talk to you about losing weight. You know, if you're going to run a race, I've never seen a race where people are carrying around those rucksacks you know what I'm talking about in the army, you get those big backpacks that are full of heavy weights. Well, if you're running a race, you don't carry that with you. And why is that? You don't want the extra weight, do you? You want to remove the weights, Hebrews 12 And verse one says, Therefore, since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight and sin which cleans so closely. We are running a race and any additional obstacles or any weight needs to be discarded, if we are to get to heaven. Christians also need to realize that that the sin there that is associated with that removal is a weight. Sin is a weight in the life of a Christian. It's something that weighs you down. It's something that's difficult on you, it wears you down and takes a toll on you. So often we cope with issues by trying to internalize by trying to say that I'm going to ignore that and just carry on with the but sin weighs us down. We try to deal with it privately. But sin is not something we can deal with on our own. We need God, he can lift the weight of our sin, and He can provide for us forgiveness. If we keep the sin to ourselves, all we are left with is guilt and shame. But if we would come to God, and ask for his forgiveness, and if we need to become a Christian, be baptized into Christ, He will remove our sin and wash it away. After we've become a Christian, if we would confess our sin and pray to Him and ask for it, he's faithful, and he will forgive us. And what a weight that lifts from our soul from our heart. It truly is liberating if we would go to him. So this year, let us lose weight, any weight, any hindrance that is keeping us from running the race as we need. The fifth. The fifth resolution that people often make is they want to simplify their life or reduce stress. We live in this world and we also find ourselves occupied with so many things. And often these things can be detrimental to our walk with God. When Jesus was with talking with Mary and Martha, Mary wanted to listen with the Savior to the Savior. While Martha was occupied with the chores of the house. He said this and Luke 10 In verse 41, Martha Martha you are anxious and troubled about many things, but one thing is necessary. My suggesting we shouldn't do any chores, my suggesting there's no work to do. And that's not the case. Chores are needed. We need to be a working people. But I think the point is, is that we can't let the things of this life completely crowd out spiritual thing. There needs to be a priority in our life, a priority of putting God first Mary was listening to the Savior. What better way could we spend our time so yes, be busy in the chores of life. Don't neglect the things you You need to do, but never push God completely out of the way, make time for God and for His Word.

Jeremy Sweets  15:08
The Bible talks about this division of our mind as being double minded. And we find ourselves that way we are split between being consumed with this world and with God often. And sometimes that affects the way that maybe we would even pray. In James chapter one and verse eight, it talks about the man that prays to God but without faith, one that prays to God but doesn't believe that he can accomplish what he said he will accomplish. And there it says that that man is a double minded man unstable in all his ways. James one and verse eight. Instead of being double minded, we need to be of singular focus. Matthew six and verse 33, is it talks about another passage of anxiety and worry about many things there. It says in verse 33, simply, But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things will be added to you. Be singular, in your focus, the kingdom of God, make it above everything else. And again, I'll say that doesn't mean ignore all the other activities of life. But it means that all the other activities of life are underneath and with the view of the kingdom of God, all those things are completed with the kingdom of God in view, and in mind. So yes, take care of the things that you need to take care of. But remember God while you do it, there's a lot we can do in the new year, we can exercise more, we can manage our money better, we need to eat better, we need to lose weights, and we may need to simplify our life. These are all things that Christians need to be active in doing. These are goals that you can accomplish. Well, I didn't want to end without noticing that 28% said, focus on my spiritual growth, focus on my spiritual growth. Now, you may notice that I turned all of these resolutions into a way of focusing on spiritual growth. But I don't want to, I don't want to allow it to pass our notice that 28% of people say they want to have a better spiritual, they want to grow in their spiritual lives. 28% That's a lot of people. Have you ever felt like no one wants to hear the gospel today? No one wants to listen to God's word. No one is out there that wants to know, God. I don't know what category all these 28% or what they want. This may be some religious people that are also seeking to grow. This may involve some Christians, but a little under a third of the people are seeking they're seeking. And even some of that are outside of this category are seeking and don't know, they're just not making resolutions on it. So let us be a people that remembers the fact that others are seeking for God. In Matthew nine in verse 37, is Jesus looked down upon the crowds. And these were crowds that he was preaching the gospel to, but also crowds that he was healing. And so these were people in the den tech says in Matthew nine that when he looked out, he had compassion on them. And he told us disciples, The harvest is plentiful, but the laborers are few. there's much work to be done. So let us remember not only our spiritual goals, but the needs that are existing outside of this building, of people that need to hear the gospel of people that want to grow in their spiritual lives or develop one at all. There are many people that want that that are searching and seeking. And so let us be aware of them as well. Let me close by simply saying, don't leave God out of your resolutions.

Don't leave God out of your resolutions. Do you need to make changes tonight? This year? I would, I would beg you to do that. Do not underestimate the need to make a change in your life and in your relationship with God. If you're not a Christian, you can become one by believing that Jesus is the Christ repenting of your sins, confessing Jesus as the Christ and being baptized in the water for the forgiveness of your sins. You can have the weight of sin removed. If you do that. You can be washed clean, and your heart can be pure before him. And that's such a blessing. It may be that you've committed to live all of your life following God but you've not kept up with that commitment. Well, you need to make changes as well. If there's anyone that needs to help with the church, you can walk forward as we are about to say The song and you can ask the Congregation for that help and we'll do whatever we can to help you. It may be you don't want to walk forward you just want to talk to somebody grab any member here and say I'm I'm needing help any member here and say you need help. There's any subject to the invitation. Please come as we stand and sing at this time.
