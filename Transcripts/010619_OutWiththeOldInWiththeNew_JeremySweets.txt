Good evening. It's good to see everyone here tonight, we're a little bit depleted in our numbers. But I'm glad to see those that are here, here. And we wish those that are not speedy recovery or Safe travels, whatever the case, may be. also appreciate so much the sermon that Conrad preached this morning, really consider an honor to be able to preach alongside Mike and Conrad that they, they're very good men and very good students. And I appreciate being able to sit at their feet and listen to them as well. So I'll say that Conrad started the year off, right. So we'll continue with that. As Conrad mentioned, this is the first Sunday of the year, as we think about the new year, that's really a time of transition. It's a time when we kind of put the old year behind us, a lot of times when we do that we'll write cards or letters and review the year in the past, we might have a top 10. Or we may get pictures out and look at all the pictures from the previous year. And so we kind of put that behind us. In the new year, we are looking forward aren't, we are looking at goals or ways to improve ourselves, we're thinking about potential and possibility. And we're looking forward, you know, a similar transition takes place when one becomes a Christian. When one becomes a Christian, they are putting behind themselves the old things, the old man, as it says, And they are looking forward to the new man, there is a sense of newness. In Ephesians chapter four, we see that exact language of an old man and a new man. So I'd like to talk for just a few moments tonight about Out with the old and in with the new from Ephesians, four verses 17 through 32. Out with the old in with the new. Now I mentioned that this process takes place when you become a Christian. But Paul is writing this letter to the Ephesian church and maybe others that were around is that letter would have been passed to others as well. And he says that to those that are Christians, you're not walking or you should not walk as the Gentiles walk. And so it's not just a process that happens when we become a Christian one time, but we need as Christians even to continually re evaluate ourselves to consider whether we have brought in the world or allowed the world to slip into our mindset into our actions, or whether we are living according to Christ. And so that's what we're going to be looking at tonight reevaluating, putting away the old and looking forward to the new. Let me just survey this passage real quick. In Ephesians. The book is really divided into two parts. The first part is teaching or doctrinally might say and the second part is practical matters. So in Chapters one through three, he talks about the teachings of Christ and the body and what is found in those things. In chapters four through six, he gets to practical matters about how we live. And we see that in chapter four verses 17 through 32. He continues in those practical instructions, those ethical expectations. So notice just the survey of this passage. He says in verse 17, that you must no longer walk as the Gentiles walk or as they do in the futility of their minds. He uses here Gentiles, not as something that is negative in an

Jeremy Sweets  03:54
ethnic since we know that there were Gentiles among those that were Christians, but he's talking about morally and he's really generalizing them. So he says their moral activity in general for those in the world. And you might even be borrowing from the Old Testament as they look to the Jews and the nation's roundabout. So here he's talking about the Gentiles, the nation's roundabout, do not walk in there in morality. He says rather in verse 20, you did not learn Christ in that way to walk in the immorality of the nations. But you are to act differently. You are to think differently, you are to be different. Says you did not learn Christ in that way. In fact, he gets three instructions here as he talks about how you did learn Christ. He says put off the old man, that which is old you're to put away is no longer to be a part of you. He goes on to say that you are to renew your minds the spirit of your Mind and that you are to put on the new self. And then he concludes by saying there for having put away. And he gives five concrete examples or specific examples about how they are to live. And so that's where we're headed. Tonight, we're going to simply march through this texts, pretty much line by line and look at what Paul has to say. So as we think about this old man and New Man Out with the old in with the new, we see that there are really two parts to what Paul is going to be talking about. He's going to be talking about actions, but he's also going to have a heavy emphasis upon the mind upon the mind. So in Ephesians, chapter four and verse 17. Notice what he says. Now this, I say in testifying the Lord that you must no longer walk as the Gentiles do in the futility of their minds. Notice that he says you are no longer to walk there talks about a manner of life, the life that they live, and you're no longer to walk according to the way that the Gentiles do are the nation's. He goes on in verse 20, to talk about that type of walk or excuse me, verse 19, he says they have become callous and have given themselves up to sensuality, greedy to practice every kind of impurity, the language here have they have given themselves up, it's if there is no longer any self control, there is no longer any restraint, there is no longer any pause. But they are completely given themselves up. It is something they do without really considering the matter. It's something they do because it's something that they want. In verse 19. It goes on to say that they are greedy to practice every kind of impurity, a little is not enough, in that the way sin works. Sin promises, oh, you just have to take one step here, put one toe over the line, but that's never what it delivers. That's never enough to satisfy you. In fact, sin actually never does satisfy you. It just leaves you wanting more. And so we see in this passage, that they are greedy to practice every kind of impurity, how are the Gentiles walking, they're walking after their own fleshly desires, fulfilling those desires, whether it is right or not. And they are greedy to do that.

Jeremy Sweets  07:42
He says in verse 17, as he addresses the mind, he says, Now this, I say in testifying the Lord that you must no longer walk as the Gentiles do in the futility of their minds. And so he's going to address the minds before he brackets that in verse 19, as we saw with their walk or their conduct. So what is their mindset? What is their mind? And what is it doing? When he says that they walk in the futility of their minds, you're always thinking about the great power of the mind, what the mind can accomplish, we've used our mind and our collective mind as the society to tackle medicine, to tackle, you know, government structure, there are a lot of things have been accomplished with the mind. So notice the language here, when he talks about the futility of the mind. The very opposite of what is useful, it is what is useless it is what is not productive, it is what is not helpful. And so this futility of this vanity, it says if the mind is working, but nothing good has been produced. And so it is in the futility of their minds that similar languages we see in Romans chapter one, and it uses that word, the futility of their minds. So how are their minds futile war, he goes on to talk about that in verse 18. They are darkened in their understanding, you may have to get up in the middle of the night, as we occasionally do, if we hear kid, all learners are crying, or we hear something we may get up. And if there's no light, it's hard to see, isn't it? You may stub your toe. And so I usually try to get a little flashlight and get my phone out. Turn on a closet light something so I can have some indication of being able to see. And so here that sense is used about our understanding not just our physical side, but how our mind understands. And just as in the middle of the night you get up, you can't see you don't know where you're going. You're bumping around. So we see here that they are living in a darkened understanding. They don't know where they're Going, there's no direction. They're bumping into all sorts of things. They are darkened in their understanding. He says they are darkened in their understanding alienated from the life of God because of the ignorance that is in them. They do not have a knowledge of God. And so they are alienated from him. As we think about that term, alienated, that is the difference between being at home, and being a stranger. We've had the holidays, and most of us have had a chance to be with family, to be at home, you go in the front door, you usually don't knock Do you and wait to be asked to come in, you go in the front door, that's a place of comfort. That's a place where you are welcomed, that is a place of home. Now you contrast that with being a stranger or foreigner,

Jeremy Sweets  10:55
being an alien, not belonging, not having that sense of comfort, being away, not having that relationship. And here it says that they are alienated from the life of God, they have no relationship with God, they have pushed him away by their sins and by their activity, and is because of their ignorance, they do not have a knowledge of Him. And you may begin to feel bad for those that are ignorant, they simply do not know. But we see later that says it is due to the hardness of their heart. This is a willful ignorance. This is an ignorance of God's so that they are not seeking after him. They have intentionally pushed him away. They want to be alienated. And so we see this is due to their hardness of heart. The Bible talks about the heart and two ways that can be soft, and supple it can been it can seek instruction, it can want to change to do what is right or it can be the opposite. It can be hardened, unmoving, unflinching, not desiring in any way to change. Here, it says that their hearts are hard. It's because of the hardness of their heart. It goes on to say in verse 19, they have become callous, they have become countless guitar players will pick up a guitar. And if you're new to the guitar, then you begin to play and your fingers hurt. As you put them on those strings, especially as you play those low ones, they begin to hurt because your fingers are not used to that. Or it may be that you're working in some way with some kind of tool or something where you're continually using your hands, or holding some kind of tool. Well, it helps when your hands become callous, they don't feel that pain. And callous means that through repeated use, if you're playing the guitar through repeated use, you get a hard spot on your fingers, so you don't feel that pain anymore. And here's we look at the callous hearts, we see that they have practice wickedness for so long that they've stopped feeling. They've stopped having this sense of consideration about the matter. They don't even think about it anymore. They'd become callous. And so they continue in wickedness without even thinking about it. They'd become callous. And so that's connected with what it says in verse 19. They've given themselves a they have completely given themselves in to sin. And so this old man that we see in both his mind and his actions that after the gin tiles is a matter of the futility of the mind, and of sensuality or impurity. Now Paul tells the Christians, they're in verse 20.

Jeremy Sweets  14:01
That is not the way you learn Christ. You're not supposed to be living that way. Now, you should already know if you're a Christian, that that is not the way of Christ. And so we see that Paul is going to introduce this new man. So how is this new Man March? What is his character? What does he look like? Well, first of all, it's not that, right? It's not what we just saw in verse 20. That is not the way you learn Christ, assuming that you have heard about him and were taught in him as the truth is in Jesus, and now he's going to give those three instructions there to put off your old self which belongs to your former manner of life and notice the result of that former manner of life. It's not a good life. It's not a beneficial life or a profitable life, but rather it is one that is corrupt. Through deceitful desires, those that seek themselves and their own desires corrupt themselves. That's not what God wants for us. That's not how God created us, He created us with a purpose to serve him. But when we ignore that purpose and simply seek ourselves, it is a corrupting influence. Selfishness never satisfies, selfishness never satisfies. So he says, Put that off. And then the language here is of almost clothing. Just as you might put a jacket on your to take it off, that old man is to be taken off to be put off, that's a former way of life. Take it off, it doesn't fit the occasion. Verse 23, put off the old life, he says, and be renewed in the spirit of your minds, this idea of renewal, it's the opposite of what we just saw corrupting. corrupting is that which is degraded, or that which is

Jeremy Sweets  16:18
marked in a negative way. But here, there is a renewal. There is newness, there is life. In Romans chapter 12. And verse two, it says, Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind, that by testing, you may discern what is the will of God, what is good, and acceptable and perfect. There, the renewal is connected with a transformed life. A renewal is that which directs its attention to God that thinks upon God and dwells upon God so that the mind is not decaying or corrupting, but rather being renewed, there is life. And there is truth in a knowledge of God. In Colossians, three, in verse 10, it says, and have put on the new self, which is being renewed in knowledge after the image of its Creator. And I think we borrow from both of those passages, to see what it means to have a renewed mind. Its renewed, because it's focused on God, and on his will, and the knowledge of God and His will. And so he says, there in verse 23, be renewed in the spirits of your minds. Not only that, he says, and to put on the new self, to put on the new self, if you've been working out in the yard all day and you have dirty clothes, you want to take that off, don't you, especially if you have somewhere to go that night, somewhere nice. You take off your dirty clothes, you put those away, and then you put on the clean clothes. Here, that image continues in verse 24. He says, Put on or clothe yourselves with the new self, who is this new self? He says in verse 24, created after the likeness of God, if you consider that imagery, you are putting on clothing yourselves with the likeness of God, with God's likeness. That's what we are to put on. And what is this likeness, he says, in true righteousness, and holiness. Now, in one sense, we've all been created in the image of God. And I think that relates to our capacity to have a relationship with Him, our ability to serve Him. And so it can involve things like the intellect, our moral sensibilities, and different things like that. But here it goes on to say that we must use that image in order to choose to live like Him in true righteousness, and holiness. It's not enough to have the ability or the capacity, but we must also choose his, we must choose to serve Him and be in His likeness. It also says that we've been created after his likeness as we put on this new self. And so when we look at the mind and actions, the old man is going to look very different from the new man, isn't it? Well, Paul goes on to talk about five concrete examples of this new life. So let's go through these and see practically what he is talking about. What does it mean to live the new life in Christ? Well in verse 25, That's the first example. And he talks about honesty here. But let me just tell you, as we look at all three of these, excuse me, all five of these examples, there are really three things that he does. He says, Put away something, put on something. And he's going to give a reason or a motivation for doing. So. I find it interesting that it gives that reason or motivation. If God were to tell us to do something, then based on his authority, and sovereignty, we need to obey Him. Whether we understand that fully or not, we need to obey Him and serve Him. But also find it interesting that God often gives us reasons for serving him. He gives us things that would motivate us, I think he wants to engage our hearts and our minds, he wants us to understand more fully, so that we can follow after Him so that we can reason. And so he provides these rationales for our behavior. And he does that in each one of those. So notice the first one in verse 25.

Jeremy Sweets  21:08
Therefore, having put away falsehood, let each one of you speak the truth with his neighbor, for we are members of one another. Notice that they are the put away falsehood line that's associated with the old self error that follows after satan. That's what he promotes, isn't it? He's the father of lies. And so if we're gonna put off the old self, and notice the exact same words are used to put away that's the same language, put off from yourselves, put away the old man, hear the things of the old man falsehood. Let each one of you speak the truth with his neighbor. We are to be a people that speak the truth, we are to be those that are followers of the truth. In fact, you saw earlier in this passage that it says that truth is in Jesus, so if we are to follow after Jesus than we are going to be following after true, there are so many ways that people lie today, and that we can lie that we can deceive others. And we do that out of various motivations or reasons. And usually, it's selfish, we want to avoid embarrassment, or we want to avoid some kind of penalty or trouble, we've done something and we don't want others to know, we often lie in order to gain we might be able to gain a little bit of money from a lie, or we might be able to gain someone's respect that's not really deserved. And so we lie. But as Christians, lies can't be a part of who we are and what we do. Rather, we are to be those that speak the truth, despite the consequences. Even if we don't get everything that we want, we speak the truth. And he says that we are to do this with Christians or to do this with his neighbor. for we are members, one of another. And when he says neighbor, it almost made me think of everyone, including non Christians, and that would certainly be true, as we speak the truth to every one. We're not discerning when we speak truth to Christians and untruth, the non Christians. But I do find it curious here that he says not only neighbor, but we are members of one another. And so that makes me think of the body. And even if he is talking specifically about the body, we see all throughout scripture, that truth is to be our general character to whoever we are talking to. And so he says that we are members of one another, and so we speak the truth. Notice the second example, not only are we truth speakers, but he talks about anger in verse 26. And 27. Be angry and do not sin. Do not let the sun go down on your anger and give no opportunity to the devil. Here. He says, in a sense, to put away unrestrained anger. He doesn't say to put away all anger, does he? Is it wrong for the Christian to be angry? No, it's almost a command here. Isn't it be angry. So how can a Christian be angry? Well, I would hope that it would make us angry, to see blasphemy to see injustice to see the impression of those that are helpless and weak to see the see adultery that would destroy and ruin a family to see the effects of sin and what it does. That should make us angry shouldn't but the text here says Be angry and do not sin.

Jeremy Sweets  24:55
We're not to have unrestrained anger. Even maybe anger that is directing in a righteous way for he says, Do not let the sun go down on your anger. So you get angry in the morning, and you're still angry. And at the end of the day as the sun's going down, you're holding on to your anger, are we to be a people that hold on to anger, when you hold on to anger, that becomes something that consumes you. It takes over your heart and takes over your character. And so he says, don't allow anger to be unrestrained. Don't dwell on it. Don't allow it to take hold in your heart. That is not to be who you are. This actually is a quote that we see from Psalm four and verse four. There it says, Be angry and do not sin. Ponder in your own hearts on your bends and be silent, offer right sacrifices and put your trust in the Lord. There we see he says, Be angry, but yet do not sin to ponder, to dwell and be silent, and to put your trust in the Lord. When we see injustice and things that are not right. It can make us angry and upset and mad. But it's not our job to right the wrongs of the world. That is God's job. And God will do that. God will do that. So let us not allow our anger to consume us so that we act in an urn godly way. Let us restrain our anger, bridle our anger. And so we are put on, in a sense, restrained anger. Notice what he says in verse 27, as he gives this reason, the motivation and give no opportunity to the devil. Now, if we put off the old self and put on the new self, we have a master and that's Jesus Christ, not the devil. And so we don't want to give the devil any opportunity in our life. We don't want him to have an opportunity to persuade us to bring us to him. You remember what it says in First Peter chapter five and verse eight about the devil. He is a roaring lion, lion seeking someone to devour, he prowls about he's looking for you to destroy you. Would you give a lion an opportunity, I wouldn't want to give him even a small opportunity at me know, keep him behind the bars, keep him away, put up a fence, I don't want any opportunity for a roaring lion. Keep them away from me completely. And so this was Satan, keep him away from me completely. Do not give him an opportunity. Anger can create opportunities for Satan, if we don't restrain it. I talked about maybe good anger against injustice. Sadly, often our anger is not even directed at that at all. It's directed in selfish ways. I had to slow down slightly on the road that made me angry at that person. Or there are a number of other ways in which we become angry over selfishness that should not be named among us either. Notice what he says in verse 28. In the next example, let the thief no longer steal but rather let him labor doing honest work with his own hands so that he may have something to share with anyone in need. He says that you are to put off theft. Those who still are no longer to steal that is the old man. You know, our law makes a differentiation between the amount of what is stolen, talks about pilfering or theft or may even have grand theft. People even reason today not only on the amount but about who it's directed against. You know, it's not that big a deal. If you steal from a corporation or the government they have enough anyway. But notice that Paul makes no distinction like that. He simply says Do not steal. It's not talking about the amount it's okay to steal a little bit. He doesn't say that. It's not okay if the person is rich, they have enough anyway. No, he doesn't say that. He says Do not steal. The thief is not to steal he is to acquire his food goods and services in a in a lawful way.

Jeremy Sweets  29:35
But instead of stealing what does he say? Put off that but put on labor, but let him labor. Let him work. And the Thessalonian letter it says that the one that does not work should not eat. As Christians we need to be workers, workers in the kingdom but also working in such a way that we would have money to support ourselves and our families. He goes on to say that the labor is not just any labor, don't join a crime organization or follow impurity in that which would make money but he says to do honest work, good work, work that is beneficial to society. And so we see they says, the reason that you would do that is not only that you can support yourself, remember, the man that will not provide for his own family is worse than worse than an infidel, not only yourself, but he says that you can give to those in need. I like the way that he says that as well, that you might be able to have something to share. God blesses us in many ways, and often we have a surplus. We're not to be the greedy people that just wraps our arms around our possessions and says more, more more. That's not the picture of a Christian that's, that's the old man. The new man says God has blessed me, please allow me to give something to share something with those who are in need. In this world, and in this passage, we see there are takers, and there are givers. Christians are to be givers. Now, there may be a time when there is a genuine need, and you may need to take and I'm not discounting that at all. But in general, we need to be givers. We need to be givers. And so he says in verse 28, do not steal, but rather do honest labor honest work so that you can help the needy. Notice in verse 29, he says, Let no corrupting talk come out of your mouths, but only such as as good for building up, as fits the occasion that it may give grace to those who hear and do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God by whom you were sealed for the day of redemption. Notice what he says about our language. Here he says that our language is to not be corrupting. Remember what we saw about the old man about really his heart and who he is there is a corruption and a corrupting influence that takes place in his life. Well, it makes sense that that kind of person would spew out corrupting talk. They're not only corrupting their own hearts, but everything that comes out of their heart is corrupting. It is harmful. It is something that destroys but here he says, Let no corrupting talk come from your mouths, but only such as is good for building up with your words, you can use them to tear down or to build up the old man, the way of the Gentiles or the nation's is to tear down. But he says Christians are those that build up edification, we might think of an edifice, a building. And so we are to build up with our words. It is to fit the occasion that it may give grace to those that hear our speeches to be used to help others not to harm. He's gonna say a little bit later in Ephesians five and verse four, that there'll be no filthiness nor foolish talk nor crew joking, which are out of place, but instead let there be Thanksgiving. We are to put on gracious speech. Clawson says seasoned with salt. So we shouldn't be people that swear that have crude language. We shouldn't be people that talk. tell dirty jokes that shouldn't be named moments. We shouldn't be complainers. We shouldn't be gossips. We shouldn't be slanders that tears down. We need to be encouraging, faithful, saying a positive word. As Christians, we have a great hope and a great

Jeremy Sweets  34:19
message. But if we hide that message away with all this negative talk, it's not going to do much good as let our speech reflect the Lord that we serve and let us speak edifying words, and that which offers grace to those that may hear. He says in this passage as really a reason he says And do not grieve. The Holy Spirit of God might see this as a companion piece, verses 26 and 27. There he says do not give the devil an opportunity. Do not allow him to have a stronghold in your life whatsoever, but rather We are to be servants of God. We are seek to please God to please His Holy Spirit, do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God. And Isaiah 63. And this is actually a passage we looked at this morning was Kevin bein in his class in Isaiah 63. There talks about, as Isaiah recounts the history of what God has done for his people, he says they brought them out of slavery. He made them his own covenant people. They were his covenant people. But then it says in verse 10, and they rebelled, and grieved His Holy Spirits. Those that were to be the people of God grieved God grieve the Holy Spirit when they rebelled against him. Isn't it fitting here as he talks to Christians, reminding them they are not to go back to that way of life that he uses that same concept, those that are of the New Covenant, can still rebel can still go back to that old way of life, and they can grieve God. It reminds me as well that what we are striving to do in life is please our master. To make him happy with us. We'll remember from Genesis chapter six, when God saw the wickedness that was over the face of the earth, it was widespread so that the thoughts and intentions of man was only on evil continually. What does it say that God did when he saw that there is a sense of grief, it says, He repented, it upsets our great God. Our goal as Christians is not to grieve God, but to make him happy, to bring Him glory, and honor. He goes on to say in this passage, do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God by whom you were sealed for the day of redemption. Here we see, it's not only talking about God, but it mentions the Holy Spirit of God. And Ephesians. One, we saw a reference to the Holy Spirit and like to read that Ephesians, 113 and 14. There it says, In Him, you also when you heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation and believed in him were sealed with the promised Holy Spirit, or the Holy Spirit of promise, who is the guarantee of our inheritance until we acquire possession of it to the praise of his glory, for those that had believed, we saw from Acts chapter two, that they were promised the gift of the Holy Spirit, repent, be baptized, and you will receive the gift here it says that this Holy Spirit would be a seal, you might think about a signet ring, that you would have a letter that would be rolled up and they would take some wax and seal that so that it would be secure, so that there is a sense of security within it. Here, he says that the Holy Spirit will seal provide that promise that guarantee God has not left us without that promise. So why would we grieve the very holy spirit that was given to provide a guarantee to us? If we have a promise of something, we won't want to do anything to be a detriment to that or that would cause harm to the very stability that we have the very promise that we have the guarantee. That's to our benefit, we don't want to detract from it. And so he says, Do not grieve the Holy Spirit as new men, new people in God, we are seeking to give him glory and honor. One more example we see in verses 31 and 32. How are we to treat others? Well, in verse 31.

Jeremy Sweets  39:09
There he says, Let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and slander be put away from you, along with all malice. It's as if he can't stop here, as the words come out the type of sins that build upon one another, and how we treat one another. Often people live with bitterness in their hearts, and that bitterness comes out and is directed toward other people that comes out and outbursts of anger and in Wrath, it comes out as we clamor and complain as we speak evil against other people or simply hold malice in our hearts. We look down. That's a horrible way to live. That's an unhappy way to live. That's a corrupting way to live. Don't let those things To be named among you, just as you put off the old man happenings, putting off the ways and the actions and the character of the old man, don't let bitterness take root take hold in your life. That's simply a negative outlook on life, isn't it, don't allow that to be there. But rather, he says in our treatment of others, verse 30, to be kind to one another. I find my self telling my children this often. Because this covers so much about how we treat others. Be Be kind, be kind to others. treat them the way you want to be treated. Treat them in a positive way. Far too often, we're all selfish, we don't look for what is good for the other. But simply be kind. Don't be bitter and backbiting, but be kind. He says, Be tender hearted. This carries the idea of being compassionate as you're kind to others have a genuine love and concern for their welfare. Jesus when he looked out upon those that were as without a shepherd sheep without a shepherd, it says that he felt compassion. He was tender hearted for them he loved and cared for them, he sought their welfare. Let us be a people. When we look at others, we are kind and we are compassionate. He also says forgiving one another. Now the way that might be translated is simply to be gracious that carries the idea of grace within that word, Be gracious to one another. Forgive one another, allow someone some some grace. They might not deserve it through their actions, but be gracious. Anyway, Christians are calm and compassionate, gracious. Oh, that those three words could describe my life. And how hard it is to fully implement the let us be kind, compassionate and gracious. And why should we do that? Because God in Christ forgave you has been gracious to you. He's given you what you did not deserve. And so we see that we must extend that same to others. You know, I'm reminded as we look at verse 31, all those words bitterness, wrath, anger, claim or slander and malice. It's hard to really take hold of those things. If you truly recognize that God and Christ has been gracious to you, you have to push that out of your mind. But when we remember what God has done for us, we will be kind and compassionate and gracious. So let us remember those things. Let us remember those things. Understand that I went a little bit longer than maybe normal, but I appreciate so much your attention. Let us put out the old man put him off and seek to live according to the new man. If you're here tonight and you're not a Christian, you have an opportunity to obey the gospel message, believing that Jesus is the Christ, repenting of your sins and turning away from a lifestyle of sin and devoting yourself to serve Him and all things being baptized in water for the forgiveness of your sins. If you're here and you are a Christian, and you're not living as you should take this advice, reevaluate and put away that old man and seek to be renewed in your mind and then your godly actions. There's anyone subject to the invitation, please go as we stand and sing at this time.
