Luke chapter seven. Luke seven is where we're going to study for the rest of our time this morning.

Conrad Harkrider  00:21
It's good to be with you. And to see each one of you here this morning on the first day of the week, and the first Sunday of this new year, my family and I have been traveling the last couple of weeks over the holidays to visit friends and family in Texas, we did a lot of lot of driving state it for different houses while we were there. I won't tell you how many times I packed and unpacked the car, but I got a lot of practice. And we visited with three different congregations, which was really beneficial, get to see a lot of Christians and be in other places, see how they worship, see God's word being preached in, in a different part of the country. But we are glad to be back and to be with you again here today. I want us to think about the following question this morning. And that is how much do you appreciate what the Lord has done for you? How much do you appreciate or value what the Lord has done for you? There are some maybe someone even here today that they don't even know what Jesus has done for them. Their lack of appreciation is more of a it's not so much that they don't care. It's just they don't have the knowledge. But I would say for most of us here today, we would affirm that we we would say we do appreciate what the Lord has done on our behalf. But let me ask you this. If that's true, what does it look like? How could someone tell? How could they see that I am a person that truly values and is grateful for what God for what Christ has done? On my behalf. I'd say one of the greatest ways to measure our gratitude is based upon how I view my own sin. The way that I see my my sin, the way that I the way that I understand it, and how I view my sin. This morning, we're gonna look at two individuals who encountered Jesus with two very different responses in how they viewed themselves. Read with me about Simon and the sinful woman from Luke chapter seven. Luke seven beginning in verse 36. It says, Then one of the Pharisees asked him to eat with him. And he went up to the Pharisees house and sat down to eat. And behold, a woman in the city who was a sinner, when she knew that Jesus sat at the table in the Pharisees house, brought an alabaster flask of fragrant oil, and stood at his feet behind him weeping. And she began to wash his feet with her tears, and wipe them with the hair of her head. And she kissed his feet, and anointed them with fragrant oil. Now, when the Pharisee, who had invited him saw this, he spoke to himself saying, This man, if he were a prophet, would know who and what manner of woman this is, who was touching him, for she is a sinner. And Jesus answered and said to him, Simon, I have something to say to you. So he said, teachers say it. There was a certain creditor who had to debtors, one owed 500, Dinair AI, and the other 50. And when they had nothing with which to repay, he freely forgave them both. So me therefore which of them will love him more? Simon answered and said, I suppose the one whom he forgave more, and he said to him, you have rightly judged. Then he turned to the woman and said to Simon, do you see this woman? I entered your house, you gave Me no water for My feet, but she has washed My feet with her tears and wipe them with the hair of her head. You gave me no kiss, but this woman has not ceased to kiss my feet since the time I came in. You did not anoint my head with oil. This woman has anointed My feet with fragrant oil. Therefore I tell you, her sins, which are many are forgiven, for she loved much. But to whom little is forgiven, the same loves little and he said to her, Your sins are forgiven and Those who sat at the table with him began to say to themselves who is this, who even forgive sins. And he said to the woman, Your faith has saved you go in peace.

Conrad Harkrider  05:12
This is such a vivid description that Luke gives to us. It's a powerful retelling of of what happened to Jesus when he entered this man's house. I'd like for us to make some comparisons between the two individuals that are mentioned Simon, and the woman. First notice in verse 36, that he Simon is identified as one of the Pharisees, verse 37, it says that he was at the table in the Pharisees house, verse 39. And when the Pharisee, who invited him Luke seems to emphasize this point that this man was a Pharisee. It's not until Jesus addresses him that Luke, the writer uses his actual name, he calls him or he refers to him as the Pharisee. The Pharisees were known for their very strict rules and interpretation of the law of Moses, they had their traditions, they were very meticulous about keeping those things. They were respected among the people, the people saw them as Ultra religious, and they were looked up to Simon is also the host. He has prepared a, a dinner or a meal for Jesus and invited him into his house. Jesus comes in there would have been other guests that attended as well. The doors were apparently open, this wasn't a closed gathering as the others were able to come in the woman herself. She came in to listen and hear the teaching and the conversation that was going on. In verse 36, it says that Jesus reclined at the table. These tables were not like the ones that we sit and eat on where we sit down in the chair, their tables were closed, lower to the ground. So they would lay on their side and and lean on one arm and then eat with the other and then their feet would typically be curled up behind them. One of the people that comes in is this woman from the city and look at how she's referred to in verse 37. It says, In behold, a woman in the city who was a sinner. That's how Luke describes her. He doesn't tell us exactly what type of sin but it was something that was widely known. This was a notorious type of sin. She had a reputation. People saw her in this way, maybe something like adultery or prostitution, she had been labeled as a sinner. Think about someone who is addicted to drugs or who is an alcoholic, that lifestyle. Those choices start to define who they are people see them only as that she was a sinner. She's also an invited. She's not one of the honored guests. She doesn't have a place at the table. She quietly comes in. She doesn't say anything to Jesus. She makes no requests of him. She doesn't ask for anything. She stands behind him and is holding a very expensive jar or flask of perfume. Luke says that it was a it was held in an alabaster jar. Alabaster was a type of stone that was used to hold very precious and costly oils and ointments. And she brings this in intending it to be used for Jesus. She has moved. She's moved the text says that, as she's standing there, she begins to weep. Not just misting of the eyes are tearing up but the tears are rolling down off of her face. They're flowing freely. They're spilling down onto the feet of Jesus. She was moved. Have you ever? Have you ever cried like that? Well, my family is getting ready to move from Texas to Tennessee. I remember saying goodbye to our family members. And when I went to give my brother a hug. I went in and gave the hug and when I went to let go he was still holding on. After about five seconds I thought well this is kind of a long hug for two bros and I didn't really Lies how emotionally was as I felt the tears from his eyes dripping down on the back of my neck.

Conrad Harkrider  10:10
This woman is overcome with emotion. Perhaps she's thinking about Jesus, and who he is and what he represents and all that he's done, and how he's helped people and how he loves people, how he's taken people who have no hope. And he's able to heal them and bring them life and restoration. She knew that Jesus offered healing and hope in a world that a rejected and abused and had disregarded her. As she's moved to tears, maybe she is recounting some of the things that he had taught. In Luke chapter four. As Jesus stood up in the synagogue to read from the prophet Isaiah. This is what he read, The Spirit of the Lord is upon me because he has anointed me to preach the gospel to the poor, he has sent me to heal the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives, what hope that would have offered to people who are hurting and who are desperate. Or perhaps she had heard what Jesus had spoke to His disciples in Luke chapter six, bless it are you who are poor, for yours is the kingdom of heaven, bless it are you who are hungry now, for you shall be satisfied. The kingdom was not offered just to the wealthy or to the, the successful or to the ultra righteous. But Jesus extended himself to the poor and to the hungry, and to those who were lower class. Maybe she was thinking about herself. Maybe she was reflecting on all that had happened in her life. The places she had been the people that she had been with decisions that she had made. And now standing at the feet of Jesus, all of that came flooding back into her mind and it hit her when she was overwhelmed with her thoughts and her feelings. When standing next to the one who is full of so much goodness and holiness, she is overcome with emotion. Her display of emotion appears to be spontaneous. Although she intended to anoint his feet with this oil. It seems as if she did not intend to break down like this. And so as the tears dropped down onto his feet, having no rag or towel, she lets her hair down, she stoops down on the ground, and she begins to wipe his feet with her hair. Feet, feet are not exactly the most pleasant things to be around. And especially in this time when people were walking in sandals, and they traveled on dusty roads, and they walked in the heat of the day. Those streets were often covered with rubbish and animals walked on those streets leaving behind certain things. The feet, the roads that they traveled on would have been muddy and stinky and smelly, and the feet that walked on them would have not been far behind. And that's why it was a common courtesy. When you went into someone's home and you were a guest there that they would, they would offer you water. They would allow you to clean your feet before sitting down at a meal. But not only is this woman wiping his feet with her hair, notice what verse 38 says. It says that she stood at his feet behind him weeping and she began to wash his feet with her tears and wipe them with the hair of her head. And she kissed his feet and anointed them. She has lowered herself and now is expressing this ultimate show of humility and gratitude as she begins to kiss his feet. Compare this display of raw emotion and gratitude and gratefulness to what we see in Simon in verse 39. Verse 39, it says Now when the Pharisee who had invited him saw this, he spoke to himself saying this man, if you were a prophet would know who and what manner of woman this is. who is touching him for she is a sinner. We see that Simon is skeptical

Conrad Harkrider  15:00
he's skeptical. He says, If this man were a prophet, If this man were who he says he is, he wouldn't allow this scene that's going on here to happen. Apparently, Simon didn't remember the demons being cast out, and the people being healed and the dead being raised. Because if this man was a man of God, he would know who this woman really was. In Second Kings, chapter six, the king of Aram is getting so frustrated, because his plans keep getting forwarded by the king of Israel. Every time he sends men out, they are stopped, every time he tries to make an attack, it doesn't work. And finally, his men come to him and they tell him that his words, the words that he speaks in his bedroom, are being reported by Elijah the prophet, to the king of Israel. Simon makes the assumption that if Jesus is a prophet, he knows who this woman is, and if he knows who this woman is, he wouldn't allow her to have contact with him. Simon's view is that the religious people, religious people don't touch sinners, they don't interact with them, they don't have dealings with them. When I was growing up, dad had a truck with a bench seat, and the three of us boys would crawl up in there, we'd all sit next to each other. And the window seat was prime real estate for two reasons. access to fresh air. And you could also position yourself to where you didn't have to touch anyone else, you would rather be hugging the door sitting on your side than your need to graze the person next to you. Simon didn't want to touch a woman like this. What is our attitude towards worldly and sinful people? Are we turned off? Are we disgusted? Do we scoot ourselves away? From people like that? Do we remove ourselves so there's no real relationship communication, no connection we prefer to let people like that just stay in another place to live their life and to us to live ours. Jesus had a heart of compassion. He loved all people he was willing to sit down and eat with tax collectors and sinners and prostitutes and people who were poor and sick and diseased he loved sinners. Jesus goes on to tell Simon, a parable. He addresses him by name Simon, I have something to say to you. And he tells him a parable about two debtors one who owed 500 The Naira and the other 50. A dinero was about a day's wage. And so if you calculate that out, the one man owed about two months worth of wages. And the other was about 10 times that about 20 months worth of wages. Jesus says that the moneylender came and forgave them both of the debt and then he asks Simon which one will love him more? Simon is kind of acting like a politician here. He slowly waves into the waters before he answers the question. He says, Well, I suppose it was the one who had the larger debt. When I was younger, and still learning how to drive, I was pulling into a parking spot at a bowling alley one night, and I got a little too close to the car, who was next to me and ended up rubbing some of the paint from that black truck on the side of the white sedan. The owner of the car ended up coming out of the bowling alley. And I guess he was in a really good mood that night because when he saw the paint on the car, he looked at me and he said that that's nothing I'll just, I'm not even going to file a claim. And he let me go completely. I want you to imagine if on the other side that I had rubbed into, there was another car that had run into the vehicle and had completely smashed in the door so that you could not even open it up. What if that same man came out and said you know what I'm not. I'm not even gonna file a claim just don't even worry about it. Jesus says that both of these debts were canceled. Jesus then turns to this woman to make his point.

Conrad Harkrider  19:57
Talks about the things that she has done and the way that she has treated him it shows us that Jesus, Jesus noticed these things that he saw he observed. He was aware of the way that people treated him how they interacted with others, how they responded to him. And in his response to the woman, we see that Simon was inconsiderate. Jesus says that when he came into the home, there was no common courtesies offered. There was no water for his feet, there was no kiss of greeting, these are things that a person would do for a guest. Like we would offer a drink of water or we would ask to sake take someone's code or we would invite them to come in and to have a seat. But none of these things were done for Jesus. It was as if he was an unwelcome guest in the home of this Pharisee. This is contrasted with the woman in verse 20, verse 47, it says, Therefore I say to you, her sins, which are many are forgiven, for she loved much. She loved much, she did far more than what was expected. Simon was unwilling to offer water for her feet, but she cleaned his feet with her hair and her tears. Simon offered no greeting. But she got down and kissed his feet. Simon had no oil to anoint his head, but she took precious oil and put it on his feet. She loved much. Her love for the Lord was overflowing, it was a bounding It was pouring out. We also see that Simon was a man who was self righteous. He considered himself good. That's why he would not touch this woman not have dealings with her, he would expect that Jesus would do the same. He looked at the weaknesses and the failures of others. And that reassured him of his own moral standing and made him feel good about his life. But yet we see he was blinded to his indifference. He saw himself as sufficient and that was a handicap to him. He didn't need Jesus, he was relying on his own actions on his own, on his own works, his ability to keep the law. If you compare that to the woman, look at what Jesus says in verse 50, he says, Then he said to the woman, Your faith has saved you. This is a woman of great faith. She had faith that compelled her to go and seek out Jesus to fully trust him. This was a faith that was courageous, can you imagine going into this house where these distinguished guests are dining at the table, knowing that she would probably be ridiculed and looked down upon and yet she still goes in this was a faith that was unashamed, standing in the presence of these men, and allowing her emotions to freely pour out. This was a faith that offered her salvation, Jesus says Your faith has saved you because of her faith, she received mercy, and forgiveness. I'd like to finish this morning with three observations.

Conrad Harkrider  23:39
First of all, notice that it's not just a sinful woman that's depicted in this story is also a sinful Pharisee. That is described here. Romans chapter three and verse 23, tells us that all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God there, there are no people that live on this earth that are perfect. Everyone who has ever walked the face of the earth, except for our Lord has fallen short of God's glory. And there are no perfect elders or Bible class teachers, there are no perfect parents. There are no perfect bosses, even the one who may seclude themself and spend large amounts of time and meditation and focus on prayer, even they fall short of the glory of God. And that's so critical for us to understand and to and to remember, because sometimes we feel like we are or people feel like, we don't need God. I'm a pretty good person. I haven't committed any large crimes. I've never killed anybody or I've never harmed anyone else. And so what doesn't matter if I do this religion thing, or the other extreme is we've If a person feels like there's no way they could ever be in God's presence, they can never come to church, they can never be a part of a church because of all the things that have happened in their prior life. And what's happening in both of those situations is we are comparing ourselves to other people, or making the standard. Someone else another person that we see, instead of the Lord. There's a reality show a few years ago called hoarders. I don't know if you ever saw it, but it was. They go into these houses of people that had stored insane amounts of stuff. They were prisoners of their own homes, they couldn't even get from room to room because there was so much stuff in the hallways and the closets, in the bedrooms, it was everywhere. And the point of the show was to try to help these people, they would send in the therapists, they would have a professional organizer, and they tried to get them to clean this stuff out, you know, what we would think to ourselves, we watched that show. As we move over a pile of paper on the couch to sit down, we'd say those people have a problem. I mean, they need to get some help. That is that is extreme. They are, they're in a difficult situation there. If our hearts and our lives were laid open today, for all to see, the truth would be that we all have junk in our closets. Instead of looking at the person over here, who's in a really bad situation has a lot of things going on a lot of things stacked against them, we need to focus on, focus on ourselves. Every one of us has weaknesses, vulnerabilities, temptations, things that we struggle with. Simon looked at this woman and thought I'm nothing like her. But yet he overlooked his pride, his greed, his indifference. Jesus said that we need to focus on ourselves to remove the law that is in our own eyes before we focus and think about what other people need to change. Because all have said. Did you notice what verse 42 says, verse 42, Jesus and speaking of the, in this parable, He says, And when they had nothing with which to repay, they could not pay both debtors, the one who owed 50, and the one who owed 500, could not make repayment, they were unable to satisfy this debt. If you've ever been on a college campus before, especially a large university, you've probably struggled with the process of finding a parking spot. And some of these campuses are very strict on their rules, they have designated lots where only you can only Park and uncertain times you have to move your vehicle and they're very strict. You stay for longer than 1015 minutes. And they said, Well, these little carts out there to give you a ticket.

Conrad Harkrider  28:34
I read recently that there's a university out west, that will not allow you to get a diploma or a transcript. If you're applying for graduate school or for a job, they won't allow you to get those things if you have outstanding parking violations. Now, by the way, the same rule applies if you don't pay your tuition. So if you haven't paid for your tuition, they will allow you to get your diploma, they will allow you to get transcripts from the school. And that seems to make sense. If you don't pay for the education you've been given Why should be allowed. Why should you be allowed to get a diploma. But the point is, in both cases, you can't get your degree until you've paid the fine. Our sin is a fine that is against our account. It doesn't matter if it just happened once if it was very minor or small. Or if it's happened numerous times over and over again. Our sin is a debt that is against us and doing more good not parking in the restricted zones ever again. That doesn't release us from our debts. It doesn't take it away keeping the Lord and following It perfectly cannot remove our sin. It is only through the grace and the mercy of Jesus Christ. We can't do enough good to save or deliver ourselves. This woman needs she needed Jesus, this Pharisee needed Jesus, and each one of us needs the saving grace of our Lord. Finally, thankfulness offers more. I hope this is one of the main points that you'll take away from the text that we just looked at together that thankfulness offers more this woman despite her past, despite all the things that she had been through, despite what had occurred in her life, she showed tremendous love and appreciation for Jesus, because she was coming from a heart of gratitude of thankfulness. And the question is, do we feel the same way are we overflowing with gratitude for the Lord, for the forgiveness for the hope for the redemption that he's offered us? When we see our own sins, and understand that those were, like putting us in a burning house, that we were in a hopeless situation, and yet God sent Christ, and through His sacrifice is like taking us out of that burning house. It's like pulling us out of a boat that is sinking. That should result in us having a lifetime of gratitude, of gratefulness for the Lord. And what that does is it changes the way we serve Christ and serve God on a daily basis. We serve Him with more zeal, we do more than the bare minimum, than the least amount that is expected. This woman comes in, she gets down on the floor, she is anointing his feet, she's pouring herself out to the Lord. And that's the way our service should look. That's the way our lives should appear, offering more energy, more love, more attention, more money, more time, to the things of God, because we are so thankful we are so moved by what Jesus has done for us. He gave his life so that we can be renewed and restored, I want to close with just a few ideas about that. Sometimes we get so busy with the things that are going on that we don't pause, we don't reflect we don't take time enough to consider what God has done for us. And it leaves us feeling complacent, and maybe disgruntled and we complain and get upset about circumstances. Maybe one thing we could do is to, to write down to keep track to take note of the things that we are grateful for. In our family, we have a practice at the end of the day. As we're sitting around the dinner table, we go around and each person says one thing that was good or beneficial that happened to them that day.

Conrad Harkrider  33:31
It's just a way of reminding us of all the blessings that God has given to us. But write those things down. Keep a journal, keep a gratitude journal to keep them at the front of your mind. We need to meditate more instead of having to read the radio on. Think about the blessings that God has given to you on the way to work coming home from work, it helps reset your mind put you in the right frame. And then also speaking to others. Someone says how are you doing? Instead of focusing on all the bad things and the difficult things and the struggles and the hurts? Tell them about what God has done to bless you. Tell them about how God has helped you how he's strengthened you how he's allowed you to grow and move forward. Express your thankfulness about God to others. Do you appreciate what Jesus has done for you? We're going to close this morning with a song and an invitation. We invite you to make your life right with the Lord. If there's something that we can do to encourage you please come down to the front as we stand in saying
