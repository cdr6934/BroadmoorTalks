Good morning. It's good to see everyone here this morning. It's good that we can gather together and worship our God. Our goal here at Broadmoor is to give God glory and praise and honor and all that we do both here in worship and in our lives. And so appreciate the fact that you're here with us this morning. Let me also say Happy New Year, we're a week into the new year, but this is actually the first Sunday that we have. And so as Christians, you know, we think about a new year not as only a time to stay up to midnight and, and do different things like that. But we think about really our service to God. We think about another year as past time is marching on. And we best make use of our time to the best of our ability. And Broadmoor, we've also used the new year as a time to do a few different things. One of those is to have a singing. And so we were able to have a singing this past Friday, it was very encouraging. I was not actually in the building, but I was able to watch and sing with with Ezra at home for a little bit. And so that was encouraging. None of the thing that we've been doing in the last few years is having a theme for the year. And we're going to do that again this year. And the theme this year is faithful stewards, faithful stewards. And so I'd like to talk just a few moments this morning about stewardship and about being faithful stewards. And we'll be using the text from Matthew chapter 25. That was our Bible reading. And that includes the the parable of the talents, the parable of the talents. I think this passage, well illustrates what it means to be a faithful steward of faithful steward. So it will serve as really an introduction to what a steward is, and what is expected of a steward. You know, it's really not a, a term that we use a lot today. But it is something we see in Scripture. Before I even get into the definition, though, let me talk just a little bit about this particular passage of the parable of the talents and how it fits within the context. In Matthew chapter 24, there is a question that is put to Jesus, as Jesus says about the stones of the temple that that not one would be left upon another. And so the disciples there asked Jesus, when are these things to occur? But then they continue the question by talking by asking, When will this occur? And what is the sine of these things and the age to come? And so there's kind of two questions that are directed there. What about the destruction of Jerusalem? And what about the end of the age? And that passage can be difficult at times, partly because of the going back and forth between those two subjects. But as we look in verse 36, he says, But of that day, and so I believe there is speaking of the end of the age, he says, no one knows when. So he talks about some signs earlier, particularly I believe, as he references, the destruction of Jerusalem. And so the question about signs he points to that, but the question of when, and particularly when will the end of the age come? Jesus answers that no one knows that that is not known. That is not for you to know. And he says in verse 42, therefore stay awake, for you do not know on what day the Lord, your Lord is coming. Therefore, be alert, therefore, be ready. And he says this again, and similar words in verse 44, as well, there he says that, you must also be ready, because the Son of Man will come at a time that is not expected. And so the answer there is to be ready in Matthew 25. And I actually should have included the very last passage of Matthew 24. There's also a parable there.

Jeremy Sweets  04:22
We see a series of parables where Jesus teaches further about being ready, being ready servants in light of the fact that we do not know when the Son of Man will come. So how can we be ready? Well, it's not by knowing the date and delaying our activity until the final day when he comes because we don't know when he will come. But instead, the passage teaches that we should always be ready. We should continually be ready. And so in Matthew 24, verses 45 through 51. There he talks About a steward, a wise and faithful steward. Or he asked who is a wise and faithful steward. And he also tells about a man that is derelict in his duties. He ignores his duties when the master delays and coming back in chapter 25, and verses one through 13, he tells the parable of the 10 virgins are the those that are waiting at the wedding. Five are wise, because they are prepared and five are foolish, because they have run out of oil. In chapter 25, verses 14 through 30, which was our Bible reading, we see two kinds of stewards. Now he doesn't use that term. But as we define that in just a minute, we'll see that that is what he's talking about. And he talks about those that are faithful and active in service. And there is one that is slothful and wasteful in service, and he is an evil steward. And Matthew 25, verses 31 through 46, as the chapter concludes, or closes, again, there are two groups, and the choices to be made about which group we are to be in. But Jesus says that there are those that are righteous, at the judgment, determined to be righteous. And they do that by by serving, by having compassion for those that are the least of the ease, and there are also those that are wicked, they ignored their duty in life, their duty to Jesus did not see Jesus in person, but when they were not kind to their brother, they were unkind to Jesus Himself. And so these parables, take us through the teaching of Jesus, that we are to be ready and be prepared as servants. And we want to highlight, as I mentioned, chapter 25, verses 14 through 30, as it talks about stewards there so what is a steward what is a steward? Definition one definition here says A person employed to manage another's property, especially a large house, or a state, another way of wording that a person whose responsibility it is to take care of something. And so we don't use this word a lot. Although I believe we have the concept and our country up. A babysitter is a steward, you leave them in charge of your children, a house sitter may approximate that you may think of, if you got stocks and things like that a fund manager you hand your money over to someone to manage. And so that's the idea that we see. Steward. Now, when I looked this up, I Googled I was looking for a picture of a steward. And we see a stewardess, we have that concept on an air on an airplane. A stewardess is one that attends to us and a male steward is there. And England and I was unaware of this at sporting events, the the people that have the bright yellow jacket and kind of stand out and watch. They're called stewards there. But in the Bible, it carries more of this idea of one that has been entrusted with property or possessions in order to care for it. Now, it's not their property or possessions, but they are managing it. And so we see what a steward there is.

Jeremy Sweets  08:32
One example of a steward is Joseph. Joseph was made a steward three times over in the first case, as a part of his house, it says on Potter for made him overseer of his house and put him in charge of all that he had. So he left all that he had in Joseph charge, and because of him, he had no concern about anything, but the food he ate. And here it perfectly illustrates what a steward is. Potiphar gave his possessions his house over to Joseph to look over those things, to manage those things. Was Potiphar also managing them? No, it said he had no concern for that. He had a steward and so he gave those over to Joseph. We also see that this occurs for Joseph both while he is in prison, and also at the palace. Joseph is giving given charge of a great many things and so he functions as a steward. He works as a steward is a servant of his master, but he is in charge of all that he sees there. As we come to our reading in Matthew 25 and verse 14, the passage is introduced this way, for it'll be like a man going on a journey who called of His servants and entrusted to them, his property, the man was going to be away, he was going to be unable to manage his affairs. And so he calls servants. And he interests them, He gives them the property in order to look over his own property. They are expected to work on his behalf. They are expected to manage his affairs as he would caring for those things. And so we see this conscious concept of stewardship of stewardship. Well, we'll be talking more about that this year. But I want us to understand fully what a steward is. I think this has great applications, which is obviously why we pick this as a theme, the elders pick this as a theme, because Christians are to be stewards. Christians are to be stewards. And so we see parables and examples of stewards that that can be very beneficial for us to think about. Well, let us continue on into this passage. And really, you're going to see as you do, in much of these parables, two kinds of people, the good, and the wicked, the good and the wicked. And so notice a few things about the good and faithful servants. The first two servants that are mentioned here are good and faithful. I'll mention that there are three that are mentioned two are good, and one is not so good. The two that are good are given 10 talents, and five talents. And then we see one is given one talent. Let me just step aside and mention really what is involved in a talent I mentioned they were entrusted, I should have done this under the previous slide, you'll forgive me for that.

Jeremy Sweets  11:56
There's a great deal of money that was entrusted here to these individuals, these servants, a talent was a large sum of money, factor a talent from what I understand, you might say it was 600 days or 6000 days of wages. denarius was a day's wage and so 6000 would proximately be 20 years. If you were to think of someone today, that makes maybe $40,000 or $50,000, that would be equivalent to 800,000 or a million dollars. And so it was a large sum of money, even the one talent individual was not simply given, you know, $20, but he was given a large sum. And so we see that they were entrusted with a great deal. Now the good and faithful servants and mentions of the first to notice in verse 15, it says to one, he gave five talents to another two and to another one each according to his ability, then he went away 16th, he who had received the five talents went at once and traded with them. And he made five talents more. So also, he who had made two talents made two talents more, notice the size of madness that's involved with the good and faithful servants is decisive. He goes at once to do the will of the master. And his goal there in his decisiveness is to please the master. His goal there is to do what the master would have him to do. And so we also say that the good and faithful servants are pleasing, are seeking to be pleasing. They're seeking to do what the master would have them to do. Notice that these aren't simply going off on their own direction. They're not simply going off to live it up and act like this is their money to do what they want with no, but they are under the direction, the guidance of the master, not with the details, not with every single detail saying I want you to do all this they are to manage it and make decisions but it is on behalf of the master and so they seek to be pleasing to Him. We also see that the good and faithful servants are active. Notice that they go and they trade. They use the money that is there so that they can increase the funds. They are working on behalf of the master. Again, the understanding in this text is that the the capital or the original money given and the profits belong to the master. It's not the ownership of the servant. They're not given here a portion of this but this is all For the master, and they are active in his service, active in his service. And they are productive. It's not just activity or wasteful energy that is used here. They are active and they are productive. The five talent man trades and makes five talents more, the two talent man trades and makes two talents more. And that would have been a tremendous gain on their part as they worked for the master. So they are decisive, pleasing, active and productive. And notice the results of this, you see this in verses 20 through 23. It says and he had received the five talents came forward bringing five talents more saying Master, you delivered to me five talents here I've made five talents more, as Master said to him Well done good and faithful servant, you have been faithful over a little I will set you over much Enter into the joy of your master. And so he enters into or is asked to enter into the joy of his master. It's interesting to see that the good and faithful servants were seeking to please their master. And that's exactly what they did, as the master invites them into. There's the sense of fellowship of being invited into this, there's a sense of being invited into the joy. They were seeking to please. And they did that. They were invited into the joy of their master. And it says very similar thing of the two talent man who was active and productive and he was invited to enter in. He is called they're a good and faithful servant.

Jeremy Sweets  16:57
He worked on behalf of his master, and he worked on behalf of his master until he returned. It's interesting to note in the first parable and chapter 24, verses 48 through 51 or 45 through 51. That that's the opposite of what that person did. The master delayed and so they stopped short and they clipped. But here we see the good and faithful servants persisted and they're active sir service. Well, the one talent man, you'll notice how he acted. In verse 18. We see his actions. But he who had received the one talent went and dug in the ground and hid his masters money. That was his choice, his decision. So let's notice the wicked and slothful servant. You'll see when the master comes He gives an account of what he has done. You'll see this in verse 24. He says he also who had received the one talent came forward saying Master I know you to be a hard man reaping where you did not sow and gathering where you scattered no seed. So I was afraid. And I went and hid your talent in the ground here. You have what is yours? And so we see he is not marked by decisiveness and action but rather by fearfulness. There is a fearfulness and you know, there's some question whether he's accurate in his depiction of the master here but regardless, he is fearful. He is fearful and so he chooses not to act. He is misinformed. Now he may be misinformed about the true character of his master. But even if he is not he's misinformed about what he should do. He says that the master is one that reaps where he did not so he is one that is true in business. And so if he is shrewd in business, what do you think he expects of His servants? Not to certainly hide his money. So if he's not misinformed about the character of the master, he is misinformed about how he should serve him. And so he is not putting at the forefront of his mind pleasing his master, but rather he is fearful and he is slothful. Instead of going and trading. He hides and sits and waits. There is no activity on his part. The fear led to inactivity. His fear led to in activity. And so he is not productive. In fact, when the master refers to him later in this passage in verse 30, he says, and cast out the worthless servant That's quite a indictment. That is a binding statement. This man is useless, good for nothing. Now, that's certainly an insult today, we all want to be productive people, we want to be useful individuals. So what does it mean to be a useless servant, while the servant did no good, when the master could have hid his own money, if that's what he wanted to do, and what would be the difference, there would be no difference. So the master says that you are not fulfilling your purpose. You have shown your purpose, you have a use, but you've ignored it. You are useless in the service. This servant was wicked and slothful and useless. And so instead of being invited to enter into the joy of his master, this individual has actually cast out, he loses the fellowship that he had with his master, and he is cast out. You know, there's so many lessons that we can learn as we look at this parable. It's very clear as scripture often points us to the fact that we have two choices, don't we? There are two paths that are set before us. And we must make a decision. We can be those that serve God and serve God faithfully, and true to him. Or we can be those that that shun our duty, turn away from our duty. And so the first thing we need to see is that we have a decision to make don't wait. We have a choice to make. And it's always before us. It is ever before us choose this day. That's one of the messages of Scripture.

Jeremy Sweets  21:57
As we think about being faithful servants today, let me point out three lessons that we can learn. The first is that we need to acknowledge the owner, we need to acknowledge the owner. If we are stewards, as Christians, and I believe that we are, the first thing we need to understand is who we are and who the master is. It may seem very simple, but a lot of things go wrong when we confuse those things. And so we see for example, in First Chronicles 29, verses 14 through 16. There David as He is praising God, as he prepares to build the temple or as he prepares for the temple to be built. He thanks God, and he says, the building here is really all your own, you have given us all of this. So whatever building is to take place is in an honor and recognition of you. We sang the song, the Jeremy lead for us that is borrowed, I believe from this passage we give thee but binome David recognized that God had entrusted and given him all that he had. The same is true for us and James one and verse 17. God is the good and perfect giver of every good and perfect gift. God has given us all things as people we are stewards, we have been entrusted. Everything that we have comes from God. And if we're to be faithful stewards, the first thing we have to do is acknowledge that. And that is a problem in this country, isn't it? Far too many people say, well, that's my money, and everything I have is mine. Everything I do is mine. But we need to acknowledge and recognize that God is the giver. And we are simply those that are entrusted. Do you see how that affects our actions? As long as we acknowledge God is the master and we're the stewards that's very different attitude and action from one that says, I am the master. I do as I please. In First Thessalonians two verses three and four. Paul there says that he had been entrusted with the Gospel, Paul recognized that he was a steward of the gospel. God's great and glorious message of salvation is something that belongs to God but he had given the Paul so that he could speak it out to the Gentiles. And so he was entrusted with the gospel and he acknowledged God is the owner, and he acknowledged themselves as the servant. We need to have this same attitude today. And let me point to one example we see in First Corinthians chapter six Open your Bibles here to First Corinthians chapter six.

Jeremy Sweets  25:17
Notice in verse 18. There he says, Flee from sexual immorality. Every other sin a person commits is outside the body, but the sexually immoral person sins against his own body. Or do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit within you whom you have from God, you are not your own, for you are bought with a price. So glorify God and your body. We're going to be talking this year about many different ways in that we are stewards, we everything we have comes from God. And so we need to practice stewardship when it comes to our families, our finances, really in every act of life, we need to practice stewardship. But one of those is when it comes to our bodies. Do you ever heard anyone say today that this is my body, I'll do as I please. This is my body. I'll do whatever I want. This comes up, particularly in the case of an abortion, or that's an argument that's often use. Many mothers will say this is my body, it is my choice. Many other people when it comes to other things act like that. This is my body, I can choose to have sexual relationship with anybody that I want. That is the attitude that is so prevalent today. This is my body. But what does God say? Whose body? Is it really? The passage says that you are not your own. You have been bought with a price. Our bodies and everything else that we have comes from God, our bodies and everything else we have is God's and were to use it in his service in His service. So do we have the right to have an abortion? Saying that that's my body? Certainly not? Certainly not. Do we have the right to engage in sexual immorality, whether that be before marriage, people that are unmarried, engaging in sexual activity will have the right saying it's my body? I'll do as I please. Certainly not. Our bodies are gods, we are using them in his service? Do we have the right to dress how we want? This is my body I can wear what I want? Do we have that right? Or should we not use it in glory to go and dress in a way that would be appropriate and not inducing of loss from others? Do we have the right to say this is my body? Certainly not. Let us use our bodies in each and every way that we use our bodies, not as masters or owners. But as stewards. As stewards. We need to understand this point, our bodies belong to God. Now if our very own bodies belong to God, really we can extend from that money and other things. Everything else belongs to God, we are but stewards. And so we must acknowledge the owner, we must not only acknowledge the owner in that He has given us these things, but we must acknowledge the owner in using the things that He has given us in a way that would please him. That means that the owner sets the direction or is his will, that servants must seek to obey. The servants that were called were to use the money in order to be productive, and make more money in business. That was the will of the master that left in the parable of the talents. So it is today we must seek to use our bodies, our money, our finances, our time all of these things, to use it not in a way that that we think is good, but in a way that God thinks is good. Let God set the direction. Let him be the master.

Jeremy Sweets  29:45
allow ourselves to be the servants. We will do well and we'll be faithful stewards today. If we understand the relationship and who is who. God is the master we are the stewards we must also be Active in service, the act of in service. This was the main point that's brought out in the parable of the talents. The good and faithful servants were good and faithful because they were active. They did not like as I mentioned that the end of the parable chapter 24, they did not abandon their duties because the master was delayed in coming. You know, that happens today. There are those that become Christians. But as time marches on, and they don't see God coming back, they don't see Christ coming back. You know, maybe he's not coming back, they reason. And so they turn their attention elsewhere. But faithful stewards are those that do not give up. The text says of the parable, the talents that the master came back to settle the accounts, he came back to settle the accounts. And when he looked at them, they were judged based on the fact of whether they were active in his service. In first Corinthians 15, in verse 58, there it says, Therefore, my beloved brethren, be steadfast, unmovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, for as much as you know that your labor is not in vain in the Lord. Now, what's interesting about that passage is it's a conclusion to the chapter. It's a conclusion to the question about whether we will be raised, again, whether we will experience the resurrection, and Paul says, we absolutely will, because Christ, the first fruits was raised. And since he was raised, we also will be raised. And so that passage points us to the resurrection as a an element of the judgment. It is a time when the accounts will be settled. At the resurrection, we will be judged, won't we? And so the conclusion in chapter 15, verse 58, therefore, since there is a resurrection, since there is life that continues, since judgment will come, therefore, be steadfast, unmovable, always abounding. I love that image, because there's a few different things going on there isn't? What's it mean? To be steadfast, steadfast means certain? And sure, what does it mean to be immovable? Well, that means you can't be moved, right? You put some post and concrete into the ground when you don't want it to be moved. And so we're to be those that are immovable in the Lord, in our commitment, were to be like that post in concrete. We're not moving away from the Lord no matter what would come. Not only were to be immovable, but we're also the abandoned Howery be a bounding were to be productive, were to continue to grow. We're to continue in the Lord and in His service. And so we remain steadfast and sure and certain, we do that by being immovable in our commitments, but productive and abounding in our service. Since there is to be a judgement, let us be active. Let us be active. Let us all be active. We ask you a question. Why was the one talent servant condemned? wasn't because he only had one talent to begin with? It certainly wasn't wasn't, it was because he didn't take and use what he was given. There are many people today many as I dare say every one of us look to others and begin to compare, say, I wish I had that ability. I wish I had the ability to do that. I appreciated that person. I'm completely absent in that. I wish I could do that. Does God expect us to do everything? Does God expect us to do more than we're able? No. But God expects us to use what He has given us. And let me remind you as well, the one talent man was not a person that had some pocket change, to look over.

Jeremy Sweets  34:38
Sometimes I think that we have been given a tremendous amount. But we minimize it when we compare it to somebody else. We have a million dollars that were to look over. But it's not 2 million. It's not 5 million, you know even those that We may think are not as blessed as others have been given a tremendous amount by God. And so the question is not what is that person doing? I try to teach my kids this, don't don't pay attention, you know, to your sibling, your sister, your and I'm not asking you to do what they're doing, what can you do? And that's the question for each and every one of us. That's a question that gets our eyes off of others, and puts it firmly on God, and what He has given us, and what we can do in His service. There is not a single person in this room that is not blessed. That is completely devoid of abilities. There's not a single person here. And so we need to understand that we need to be active in service regardless of our particular talents, our particular abilities, the amount of money we have amount of time we have, whatever that is, use it, use it. So let's stop comparing you know, it doesn't do any good anyway, it just gets you down, and makes you inactive. So let us look to God, be thankful for what we have, and serve him to the best of our ability. Let us also prepare for the Masters return. We are to be workers in the kingdom, we must know that God is coming back. And just as the master in the parable of the talents came to settle the accounts. So it is true that God will come back. And we will settle the accounts in Matthew 24 and verse 42. A passage that we noted earlier there in the discussion of judgment. There, Jesus says, Stay awake or be alert for you do not know what day the Lord is coming. But be certain of this. He is coming. God will come back. That is a certainty. People talk about death and taxes, even greater certainty. And both of those is the fact that God will come again. And so we must be ready. In Second Corinthians five verse 10. It says we will give an account says that we must render to God for what we have done in the body, whether good or bad, we must give for what is due for what we have done. And so judgment will come. The question is How have we used our time and the absence of Christ when he has gone away and promised to come back in Romans chapter 14, Romans chapter 14 And verse 12. There there was some judgment that was going on when people were judging others. And Paul says, You're not going to give an account for others. But each one of us will give an account of himself to God. Let's not seek to be judges, but simply focus on what we can do in the service of God. Let us prepare for the Masters return, which is a certain this is a great thing for us to think about this year. And I hope you engage this subject and think about it. But if you're here this morning, and you're not a Christian, you're not living as God would have you to. You need to give your life to Him to recognize that he is the master and you are but the servant, you can begin that walk by believing that Jesus is the Christ, repenting of your sins and turning away from sin by confessing that Jesus is the Christ and by being baptized in the water for the remission of your sins. Once you do that, you're raised to walk in newness of life. You're a new life, a new servant, a servant of God. If you're here this morning and you are a Christian, you're not living as you should. There is no better time than right now to make your life right. There's any subject to the invitation. Please come as we stand and seeing it this time.
