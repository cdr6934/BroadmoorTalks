Good morning. Good to see everyone here today. Tell Miss Betty is not here. It was a low grumble with the reply back. That's okay. We are starting a new year. It has been the habit of Broadmoor for the last several years to choose a theme to focus on throughout the year. And we're going to do that again this year. The themes that have been chosen have been, I think, helpful things they've been themes that are fundamental to our faith. They've been vital topics within scripture. And they've helped us focus our attention both individually on important themes within scripture, but also as we do that together. So I think it's been helpful as we look at, look at themes in the year 2020. How could we not choose a theme on vision? So this year, the theme is going to be seeing Jesus seeing Jesus? What better theme could we have than thinking about seeing our Savior? That is where our focus needs to lie, and I think will benefit from the theme this year. So I'd like to introduce that theme. There's a lot of different directions, we could go with this. But I want to look at a couple of passages in the book of John, in the book of John. We need to see Jesus because we live in a dark world. And Jesus is a light, the light in this dark world. Open your Bibles, if you would, the John chapter one. John, chapter one. The opening verses of John describe Jesus as the word it says this about Jesus, the Word that he was in the beginning, that he was in the beginning with God, that he was in the beginning, and he was God. That he was in the beginning. And in the beginning, all things were created, and the word created all things. And so we know right off the bat in the Gospel of John, that Jesus Christ is God, the Eternal One. We see in verses four and five, there it says In him was life, and the life was the light of men. The light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not over comments. It makes sense that Jesus the Word is life. He is the Creator of all things. In the beginning, God breathed into the nostrils of Adam, the breath of life, and Jesus Christ did as well as God. All things were made through Him. And He was the life and this life, it says was the light of men. This light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it. You know, when it's dark, everywhere else, you can see a light from a far distance catch, it pierces, and it shines through the darkness, it cuts. But when you're in absolute darkness, that light is so vital, and so needed. You can't do much of anything without light. Notice the more powerful source here is a line that says the darkness has not overcome it, the darkness cannot overcome it. If you have a sufficient amount of light, it's you don't notice the darkness that is outside. Light is more powerful. And Jesus Christ it says is the light of the world

Jeremy Sweets  03:48
is the light of the world. In verses six through eight, it goes on to talk about a man named John and Dave talked a little bit about this man named John, he was sent from God to bear witness about this light. Now he didn't claim to be the light himself. In fact, he was pointing to someone greater, and that someone greater is Jesus Christ. Notice if you would that, that John proclaimed this message so that others might believe in him It says in verses six through eight. Now notice starting in verse nine, says the true light which gives light to everyone was coming into the world. He was in the world and the world was made through him yet the world did not know him. He came to His own and His own people did not receive him, but to all who did receive Him who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God, who were born not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor have the will of man, but of God. The Eternal God here it says the creator was coming into the world came into the world. And this creator, it seems as if if the Creator of all things came into the world that he would be readily accepted, the creation naturally would accept the Creator. But that's not what happened. In fact, we see a great conflict that exists between light and darkness. Here it says that the light came into the world but the world even though the world was made by him, the world did not know Him. The world did not comprehend Him. The world did not know him, did not comprehend Him. They did not receive Him, it says they did not or they did reject Him. There are some though it says that we'll accept him they do that by as it mentions what John says, believing in Him by receiving Jesus, and these are able to be born of God and be children of God. We need to see Jesus because Jesus is a light in a dark world, He enables our vision and our signs. Now that's what it says, in general, as you go throughout the Gospels, you're going to see that you get into some particulars about how that plays out. Jesus was most definitely rejected and he was rejected even by his own. Notice if you would, in Luke chapter four. Luke chapter four.

Jeremy Sweets  06:33
The conflicts that the conflict that John announced was played out several times in the gospels. Isaiah, the prophet prophesied about a savior that would come. And this is a similar passage, what again, they've read from Matthew chapter 11, when, when they were asking about John, whether he was the Christ or not. But notice what it says in Luke chapter four, verses 18 through 19. When Jesus came into the synagogue, he read from the scroll Isaiah and he read this passage. The Spirit of the Lord is upon me because he has anointed me to proclaim good news to the poor. He has sent me to proclaim liberty to the captives, and recovering of sight to the blind, to set at liberty those who are oppressed to proclaim the year of the Lord's favor. Notice that the lights is in a dark world. Consider what is involved in that dark world despair. oppression, captivity, blindness, but what is it that this Savior offers to all people? Well, he and does all of that he brings liberty. He brings freedom to the oppressed. He he brings good news to the downtrodden. And it says that He gives sight to the blind, this light, give sight to the blind. After that, passages read, we're going to see that that came to apply to Jesus, but the people on Jesus's own hometown didn't appreciate what he said. In fact, they played out what was said before he came to His own and His own people did not receive him. The people of Nazareth doubted, denied and disparage Jesus as that hometown annoyance from which nothing good can come. They tried to push him out of the way. In fact, he needed to heal himself if he was such a healer. They said he angered the people so much that they wanted to kill him. But the darkness did not overcome him. They were not able to kill him, he walked through their midst, but you see right away that there is a conflict between good and evil between light and darkness. The darkness did not want to receive Jesus Christ. But we see that he was the light. Another passage we see in John chapter nine is that Jesus gave sight to the blind the world is in darkness, the world is in need of light and Jesus offers that Jesus can give that the end of John at talks about the signs that Jesus did the things the miracles that He did, pointed to a greater truth. He healed a man in John Chapter Nine of physical side, but he was relaying a message about his true nature and his true character. He was the light of men, not just the physical light, but the lights in all ways. Notice John chapter nine in verse one.

Jeremy Sweets  09:42
As he passed by, he saw a man blind from birth and his disciples asked him Rabbi who sinned this man or his parents, that he was born blind. Jesus answered, It was not that this man sinned or his parents, but that the works of God might be displayed in Him. We must work the works of Him who sent Me while it is day night is coming, when no one can work, as long as I am in the world, I am the lights of the world. And so Jesus tells us man that was born blind, he comes to him and he says that you are he spits on the ground, and he makes some. And he smears that or annoyance, that says, smears that mud in his eyes. That makes sense, the Messiah is the Anointed One. And so he uses this anointing or smearing into his eyes. And he tells him to go to the poor slum and watch. And when it says that he did that, he went and washed and verse seven says, and he came back seen, he came back with the signs, Jesus gave this blind man signs. Well, the neighbor's could not believe what had happened when they saw a man with vision walking around, they had known that this man had been blind since birth. So they were said, Is that the one that's been blind? And some said, No, it just looks like it can't be because this one's walking around. And so they ask the man, or actually, while they're disputing, it says he kept saying, I am the man. It's almost like they were ignoring what he had to say. But he kept speaking I'm saying, No, I was the one blind. But now I have signs. And so they disputed amongst themselves, we see that the the conflict between light and darkness is waging. The conflict is there. We need to see Jesus. Because Jesus is light in a dark world. We need to understand that the darkness rejects Jesus and Jesus gives sight to the blind. Well, notice something else. In John chapter nine, we see that Jesus gives sights to a blind man. But there are many there that are claiming to see and have their natural sight, but they are blind to Jesus. And so that unfolds not only with the neighbors that but then when the neighbors bring this man to the Pharisees, we see that many in that passage are blind to Jesus. And John nine, verses 13 through 34. They have barriers to belief, they simply do not believe in the Savior. In chapter nine, in verse 15, we see that the Pharisees initially asked the man how he received sides. How did you do this? And he says, It was the man called Jesus. He told me to go and wash and I did and I was healed. And they didn't. They didn't believe him. Chapter Nine, verse 18, it says, They didn't believe him until they called his parents. They called his parents and asked, What happened to this one that is your son. Now his parents were afraid of what might be what might happen to them. And so they said, well just simply ask him. And so it says, a second time in chapter nine in verse 24, that they call him in and ask him again. And they asked him really to renounce Jesus because they said, We know he's a sinner. You need to renounce him. Notice what he says in verse 25 of chapter nine. Whether he is a sinner, I do not know. One thing I do know that though I was blind. Now, I see. This man

Jeremy Sweets  13:42
was very clearly persuaded by the evidence before him, I was blind, but now I see. But the Pharisees overlook this evidence, and they did it time and time and time again. They were blind to seeing Jesus Christ because they did not consider the evidence. And when they saw it, they rejected it. They persisted in their rejection. We see in verse 34, that they ultimately cast this man out. The light came into the world, and the darkness did not comprehend it. They rejected Jesus because they refuse to look at the evidence. We see as we continue on that they were also religiously mis guided. The Pharisees were the religious elite. They were the experts in the law. They claim to know God and Moses, but they did not open themselves to the possibility that Jesus was the Christ. They would not consider the further things that God would accomplish. They stubbornly refuse Jesus based upon preconceived notions. They were blind to the evidence, and they were blind because of their misguided way. One other way that people were blind to Jesus because of a fear of rejection. The evidence may have been clear for some, even the parents of the one that was born, but there was a fear of what others might think. And so people often elevate others above God. They fear what others will think or what others will do to them. And so they push aside the evidence, they push aside their belief, and they would rather have the acceptance of others. In in John chapter nine in verse 22. It says that the parents of the man born blind, feared the Jews, for the Jews had already agreed that if anyone should confess Jesus to be the Christ, he was to be put out of the synagogue. Therefore, his parents refused to acknowledge they pass the buck, so to speak, they said, simply ask him, we're not going to say these types of things are happening all the time today as well. Many people are blind to Jesus, and they're blind to Jesus, because they look past the evidence, because they hang on to misguided religious beliefs, and because they fear what others might think. And so we need to understand that there are many people still blinded to Jesus today. And there are many reasons for that. I don't know about you, but it scares me to death. Every time I open the passage. I try not to get too high and mighty when I say look at those Pharisees. Look at how blind they were. They were the real religious establishment. I understand that I go to church every Sunday, I try to make a regular practice of my faith. And so I try not to be too quick to condemn, but I tried to reflect am i doing those things? Is that found in me? And so we need to always reevaluate, consider these things and try to have a good impure heart before God. It's needed, not just for the world, but for those that would be religious. Well, what does it mean to see Jesus I think if we'll go back to John chapter one, we'll see some things that are involved in seeing Jesus. If we were to see Jesus, we will see a whole suite of other things as well. Notice in John one, and verse 14, John one and verse 14.

Jeremy Sweets  17:32
And the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us. And we have seen as Glory, glory, as of the only Son from the Father full of grace and truth. John bore witness about him and cried out, this was he of whom I said, He who comes after me ranks before me because he was before me. For from his fullness, we have all received grace upon grace, For the Law was given through Moses, grace and truth came through Jesus Christ. No one has ever seen God, the only God who is at the father's side, he has made him No. Notice what it says in verse 14, and the Word became flesh. This is the same word we encountered earlier in the passage, the word that was in the beginning. This is the word that was with God, distinct from God, but also the same as God. He was God. He was also in the beginning, when all things were created, and he was the agency of creation, He created all things. That's the word we're talking about. So when we come to verse 14, it says that this word became flesh, took on flesh, and dwelt among us. It's an amazing thought that God dwelt among us. That's exactly what we see. This word for dwell means to tent or to tabernacle, so word that was used for tabernacle. And that makes sense. As we reflect back to the Old Testament, the tabernacle was the presence of God among the people. And that's what Jesus Christ was among the people, the presence of God. The tabernacle was a mobile structure that went with the people and it was God's presence there. It was always in the midst of the camp with the camp surrounded about Jesus Christ tabernacle there became the presence of God among people. We see later in verse 18, no one has ever seen God the only God it says, so is that the father side has made him known. And so we see that this word displayed perfectly God. So when we see Jesus, what do we see? Well, the first thing in mentions is the glory. The glory And the Word became flesh and dwelt among us and we have seen his glory, glory as of the only Son from the Father. It makes sense that this is the first word that you use you remember often when the tabernacle first of all, when it was built, what did it say about? What are the say what happened there? The cloud came and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle. Use the same language there when I talked about the temple being dedicated the glory of the Lord filled the temple. It was God's presence there among the people. So Jesus says the tabernacle is the one that tented or dwelled is the presence of God, it makes sense that he displayed doesn't it? The glory of God, that's what happened with the tabernacle. And that glory is a divine glory. I don't know everything that's involved in that word, but I know that it displays the character, the nature, the brightness, the radiance, the granddaughter of God, not as some skilled Workman, not of some person, but the glory of God. And we see that in verse 14, that it was glory as of the only Son from the Father. This was the glory of God. When we see Jesus we see the glory of God we see God Himself is the radiance of the Father. The exact imprint it says, in Hebrews chapter one, Jesus Christ reveals the father. But as we move on, we see that he is grace and truth, grace and truth. Verse 14, Glory is of the only Son from the Father full of grace and truth. Yes, God is full of many things, many characteristics, and the two that it pinpoints here are grace. And true.

Jeremy Sweets  22:03
goes on to talk about the John bore witness of this and in verse 16. For from his fullness, we've seen that he's full of grace and truth, this word displaying the glory of God is full of grace and truth. For from this fullness we have all received grace upon grace, For the Law was given through Moses, grace and truth came through Jesus Christ mentions at the end of verse 16, that this is grace upon grace, and we often see that word as a heaping forth of grace. And certainly in Jesus Christ, there was a grace upon grace, this filling up this bubbling over. But another way that we might see that word, and there's a preposition in between Grace there in the original language, it says grace, and T, A, and T is the equivalent in English. And we often see that word as a negation, or the opposite of so anti defamation is against defamation, you talk about anti trust is something against trust. But that word really just means facing, facing. And in Greek, there could be many nuances that are associated with it. The reason I'm bringing this up is because many see in verse 17, a complete contrast between the law and between Jesus for the law was given through Moses, but many people think grace and truth came through Jesus Christ. But that I guess that bothers me a little bit, because I know that the Old Testament law was truth, was it not? Why do I know that it was truth? Because it came from God. It was given my God. As I studied the history, this last quarter of Exodus through Deuteronomy, I was impressed with the amount of times that God displayed utter grace to the people was the law, a means of a lack of grace. No, I don't think that was the case. Either. God was gracious in what he did. So one idea here of grace, facing grace is this idea of replacing or out shining or adding to, I don't think it's saying that the law was completely lacking in grace and truth, but now it's found in Jesus Christ, but rather it is saying that the fullness of God in Jesus Christ replaces or out shines or is greater at faces to a greater degree. And so we see the point that is being made in Jesus Christ. There is a fullness Yes, God showed truth in the old law, but there is even a greater truth in Jesus Christ. Yes, God displayed grace in the old Old testament to his people, but there is even a greater display. So much so that you could say it replaces who heard out shines what was before. And those things make sense because they're the character of God. It makes sense that Jesus displaying the full glory of God would display grace, kindness, mercy, their extended to those that are undeserving goodness to people, the kind of goodness that can only come from the exalted supreme god to a sinful people. That is the gray scene and Jesus Christ. It is a truth that is found in the very mind of God that is displayed for and to the greatest degree it is found in Jesus Christ, he is the truth. Jesus shines a bright light in this world of darkness, does he not? He has a bright light. Jesus offers us grace and truth in a world of vindication. In a world of sin, and a world of law eyes. Jesus is a bright light. Jesus offers us the kind of love that that is uncommon. We often love in a way that is self serving, that provides for ourselves. But Jesus offered selfless serving love that gave of himself for others. And God did that in Jesus Christ, as we see later in John three in verse 16. Yes, we need to see Jesus because of what he offers and what he brings. And when we see Jesus, we see God Himself. We see God Himself. Well, let me conclude and John chapter nine, and verse 35, through 38. And we'll include verse 39, with that as well.

Jeremy Sweets  26:58
What will happen when we truly see Jesus, there's an exchange between Jesus and the man that he healed. You remember, as we left off in verse 34, that this man was cast out from the synagogue, his parents had feared that would happen. So they they push the onus on to their son, let him tell you, Well, he did. And he was cast out. But Jesus went and found that man, and he asked him a question, do you believe in the Son of Maine? And he answered very simply, well, who is the son of man so that I might believe who is that one? And notice what Jesus says, you have seen him? I hope it's not lost on you that this was a blind man that had not seen anything his entire life. And he tells this blind man, you have seen him. And yes, we're talking about vision. But we'll also add here, he says, and as you who is speaking to you, you've seen him and you've heard him two very important things to do with Jesus Christ. And notice what he says, Lord, I believe, after seeing Jesus, he believed and then he worshiped. If we're to truly see Jesus today, those are the appropriate responses. We would look upon Jesus and see him and when we soon see who he is, and see the glory that displays from him displaying the very presence, light character of Almighty God, than we will believe in him, the son of man, the Savior of the world, and believing will have no choice but to worship. As we stand in awe of Almighty God and what He has done for us. This year, let us move to greater heights, to see Jesus, Nick, lead for us the song be thou my vision, be thou my vision. The first verse states Be thou my vision, oh Lord of my heart, not be all else to me save that thou art thou my best thought by day or burn by night, waking or sleeping by presence, my lines, the last two lines of the verse read of the song, heart of my heart, whatever befall, still be my vision, oh, ruler of all. Let's let Jesus Christ be our vision this year as we focus on that and really through the rest of our lives. And that's going to be our focus as the church. It may be that individually, you're asking the question, yes, but I don't know Jesus, I've never allowed him or received him into my life. You can do that by believing the Gospel message that Jesus is the Christ, just as Jesus was revealed to this blind man, and then he believes that's what you need to do. Hear the gospel message. Believe that Jesus is the Christ. You need to repent of your sin so that you turn away from your lifestyle selfishness and turn to service to God. You need to confess that Jesus is the Christ and be baptized in the water for forgiveness of your sins that's receiving Jesus Christ. And when you do that, you can be a child of God. You are a child of God. Oh, happy day. Maybe there's someone here today that's a Christian and not living as you should please make corrections in your life as well. If there's any that are subject to the invitation, please come as we stand in scene at this time.
