Good evening. It's good to see everyone here tonight, certainly good that we can come together and worship our God. If you're visiting with us, we want to extend a hearty welcome to you. Our goal here is to give God glory and honor and praise and all that we do. So we're glad that you're here with us and invite you back any chance that you have. As we seek to give God glory, we we go to his word God has spoken to us in the Bible. And so we go to his word to understand what he would have us to do and to be and there's a lot that we can learn from the scriptures. In fact, I'm not preaching on Joseph tonight. But what a wonderful text that we read about Joseph. This year, we're going to be talking about faithful stewards as our theme this year. And we see in Joseph, a faithful steward, one that was a steward over the house of Potiphar. But he was faithful to God above all things, and what an example he was, as he overcame temptation, and overcame difficulties to serve God. And so let us all look to his example as we seek to live our lives. Well, I'm not going to be talking about Joseph branwen Talk about a patriarch. Tonight, I'd like to look a little bit at Jacob, Jacob and the God of Bethel, Jacob and the God of Bethel. In Genesis 31, in verse 13, God says this, I am the God of Bethel, the god of Bethel. Now, often, when you'll see a God of a location, especially in the ancient Near East, where it was a polytheistic society, you will be talking about a local God or an idol. But that's not what we're talking about here. God says, I am the God of Bethel. And there he's talking about the place where you encountered me. And so I'd like to just go through the places where Jacob encounters God at Bethel, and references to to Bethel, and I think we can learn some lessons about this God of Bethel that we see with with Jacob. So, Jacob is, is found in Genesis, and it really starts in in chapter 25. They're talking about Jacob halfway through the chapter. And it's going to extend through chapter 3536, if you include one of the genealogies there. And so, Hebrew literature often has this kind of rise and fall, in fact, when I think about often been thinking about lately is the flood. And so the flood has half of the story talks about the flood waters as they rise. And then chapter eight and verse one, it says, But God remembered no one. So that's kind of the high point of that, that story there. And then the rest of the story is the floods receding. And so you have a lot of this kind of up and down movement, half of the story is kind of going this way, and the other half is going this way. Well, that's what you have with Jacob, as he leaves from Canaan. And he goes to Patton, RAM, and then he comes back to Canaan. So you kind of have that, that flow to the text. And so in the very first encounter we have with Jacob are one of the first encounters is when his mom mother plots to take the birthright from, or the blessing from the father, Jacob, or from Isaac. And so we're going to see that Jacob makes his brother very mad by doing that. And as he makes him mad, he actually flees from Canaan. And he's going to cross Bethel and go to Pat Amram, okay, to the north there. So the first encounter we're going to come across with Bethel is in chapter 28. And I'm going to have a little bit more lengthy readings than we normally do. So open your Bibles to Genesis 28. I'm using the ESV. And I'll be reading verses 10 through 22. Now this is as Jacob is fleeing from from Esau, and he's departing from Canaan. In verse 10,

Jeremy Sweets  04:31
Jacob left Beersheba and went toward Haoran. And he came to a certain place and stayed there that night, because the sun had set, taking one of the stones of the place he put it under his head and lay down in that place to sleep. And he dreamed and behold, there was a ladder set up on earth, and the top of it reached to heaven. And behold, the angels of God were ascending and descending on it. And behold, the Lord stood above it, and said, I am the LORD the God of a Abraham, your father and the God of Isaac, the land on which you lie I will give to you and to your offspring. Your offspring shall be like the dust of the earth, and you shall spread abroad to the west, and to the east and to the north, and to the south. And then you and your offspring share all the families in the earth be blessed. Behold, I am with you, and we'll keep you wherever you go. And we'll bring you back to this land for I will not leave you until I've done what I have promised you. Then Jacob awoke from asleep and said, Surely the Lord is in this place, and I did not not know it. And he was afraid and said, how awesome is this place. This is none other than the house of God. And this is the gates of heaven, verse 18. So early in the morning, Jacob took the stone that he had put under his head and set it up for a pillar and poured oil on the top of it. He called the name of the place Bethel, but the name of the city was love at first, then Jacob made a vowel saying, if God will be with me, and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat and clothing to wear so that I come again to my father's house and peace, then the Lord shall be My God. And this stone, which I have set up for a pillar shall be God's house, and all that you give me, I will give a full tent to you. Here it says that he is leaving Beersheba, and heading to Haoran. And he comes to a certain place now he doesn't name that place, because later, he's going to actually name the place Bethel. And so Bethel is the place that he comes. And as he comes to Bethel, he has a dream. And this dream is of angels descending and ascending. And notice what it says in verse 13. And behold, the Lord stood above it. This was a message that came from God, as often happens in Genesis and dreams and visions. And the Lord spoke to Abraham, or spoke to Jacob and said that he was the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac. And he promises him many of the same promises that he had given to both Abraham and Isaac. So one of the first things we see about this God of Bethel is that he is a God of promise and provision, promise and provision. In verse 15, he says, Behold, I am with you. And we'll keep you wherever you go. And we'll bring you back to this land for I will not leave you until I've done what I have promised you. Now the promises individually given to Jacob fit within the context of scripture of God's great promises to Abraham that will unfold and be a blessing for all nations, all people. But here in chapter 28, he specifically speaking to Jacob, and he promises Jacob that I will be with you, I will be with you. And I will bring you back to this very land of promise. God is a God of promise and provision. We see that all throughout the stories of the patriarchs. I mentioned within each one of these, you kind of have this rise and fall. So you have these, these episodes, for example, he flees from Esau. Well, when he comes back on that, that kind of ebb and flow, he's going to reconcile with Esau. And so you see many of these stories of the patriarchs. And within each one of those stories are God's words, God's promises, and you see how God brings them about, and through these things. And so here, God promises that He will be with Jacob, what a great promise that is. You also see in verse 17, Jacob, after he awoke from asleep, said, Surely the Lord is in this place, in verse 17, and he was afraid and said, how awesome is this place? This is none other than the house of God. And this is the gate of heaven. Now, just for your reference there house of God, Bethel means house of God. And so that's in part where he gets this name. But notice in verse 17, it says, how awesome is this place?

Jeremy Sweets  09:17
Now? Why was that place? Awesome. We use that word fairly flippantly. Sometimes today, talking between milkshakes and TV shows and all of that. But here you get the true sense of the word awesome. For it says that Jacob awoke, and he said, Surely the Lord's in his place, and he was afraid. He experienced a great deal of all recognizing that God was here. God is really the only one that can bring us out this true sense of all. And Jacob said, This place is awesome. And why was it awesome because God was there. God is the one that made it awesome. The God of Bethel is a God of all. He transcends what we can even really comprehend his his greatness is beyond what we can grasp. But we know he is great. We know that he is awesome. He fills our, I don't think imagination is the right word, but our sense of awe and wonder, he fills that as we think about who he is, and how great he is. Jacob recognized that here, he feared because God was there. And he recognized this is an awesome thing for God to be in this place. The God of Bethel is a God of all an awesome God. We also say that God is a God of personal relationship. Now, you may think that an awesome God would be so great and so distant that he wouldn't want to have anything to do with lowly us. In fact, the psalmist in Psalm eight reflects upon that, what is man that You take thought of him, considering how great you are, and how lonely we are, there doesn't seem like there would be any, any way that we would be able to have a relationship. But notice what Jacob says in verse 20, through 22, says that Jacob made a vow, saying, if God will be with me, and will keep me in this way that I go, and will give me bread to eat and clothing aware, so that I come again to my father's house and peace, then the Lord shall be My God. Now what Jacob has just done, it has repeats, or state back the promises that God made to him. So God says that, that I will, I will be with you, and I will bring you back. And I will be a god of provision and God. And Jacob says, if those things are true, if you hold to those things, you will be my god. Throughout Scripture, we see this simple phrase of God being the God of his people, they will be his people, and he will be their God. Within that we see that God is a God of relationship that desires to have a relationship with his people. God is great, and in some ways, transcendent and distant, because we cannot be truly like him. He is so far beyond us, but he wants a relationship with us. He comes near to us, we see that ultimately fulfilled in the sending of his own son, to great pains in a great price. He came close to us, God wants to be our God. What a great thought that is. When I pray, one of the things I prayed, I think God that I can be His child, that I can have relationship with the Creator of the universe. And that is truly an awesome thing. Jacob understood this. And he recognized that the God of Bethel was a god of personal relationship. And so he made this vow before him. Well, we're gonna see throughout the story that Jacob is going to go to Haoran. And he's going to see their Laban. Now, Jacob's father had, since Jacob to Laban, in order to get a wife, much like Isaac had gotten a wife in the land of, of his family there. So he is going to go to that land, and he's going to have various dealings. One of those is he's going to marry his daughters. Now, just as there was some deception with with Jacob and his father, you're going to see some deception that Laban takes upon Jacob, as he marries what, who he thinks is Rachel, and it ends up being Leah. And so there's some deception there. But as he's there, he marries his daughter, and he continues to work for Laban and spending many years of service. Now let's turn over to chapter 31.

Jeremy Sweets  14:11
And we're going to see that reference that we talked about where where God says, I am the God of Bethel. In chapter 31, and verse four. Jacob is preparing to leave Patton around Heron and go back to the land of Canaan. You remember God had promised I will bring you back. Well, he is preparing to leave the really the service of his father in law Laban. Notice in verse four, Genesis 31, starting in verse four, so Jacob said and called Rachel and Leah into the field where his flock was and said to them, I see that your father does not regard me with favor as he did before, but the God of my father has been with me, you know that I have served your father with All my strength yet your father has cheated me and changed my wages 10 times. But God did not permit him to harm me. If he said the spotted shall be your wages than all the flock bore spotted, and if he said the strike shall be your wages than all the flock more striked thus God has taken away the livestock of your father and given them to me. In the breeding season, the flock I lifted up my eyes and saw in a dream that the goats that mated with the flock restriped spotted and model, then the angel of God said to me in the dream, Jacob, and I said, Here I am. And he said, Lift up your eyes and see all the goats that mate with the flock or stripes spotted and model for I've seen that late all that Laban is doing to you. I am the God of Bethel, where you anointed a pillar and made a vow to me. Now Rhys go out from this land and return the land of your Kindred, then Rachel and Leah answered and said to him, is there any portion or inheritance left to us in our Father's house? Are we not regarded by him as foreigners, free sold us and he has indeed devoured our money, all the wealth that God has taken away from our father belongs to us and to our children. Now, then, whatever God has said to you do now the back story, and you get a little bit of this backstory is a deal that was made between Laban and Jacob, about about his wages, and the wages are that he would have those that are stripes, bottled and, and modeled if I got that right word order there. And Laban would have the ones that were white, and so laeven tries to take some out, and there seems to be, according to Jacob, some sort of cheating here. And he says that, that God does not allow it. So notice the flow of the text. This is what Laban is doing to me. But he says in verse, The end of verse four, but But the God of my father has been with me, he goes on, say, in verse seven, your father has cheated me, but God did not permit him to harm me. We see that Laban sees that this God of Bethel is a God of care and protection, a God of care and protection. Why even sought his harm, in a sense, but he recognized that God was with Him. God was providing his care, just as he had promised he would. God was providing his protection. When we think about how great and grand and mighty God is, it would make sense that we see him as a god of care and predict and protection. He is the one that is able, because of his greatness, to provide these things for us. And so we see that Jacob recognizes this. He is a God of care, and protection.

Jeremy Sweets  17:56
We also see in verse 13, that he is a God of faithfulness. Now in verse 13, this is where he says, I am the God of Bethel. Why does he say I am the God of Bethel? Well, he's reminding him, member, Jacob says, I've been cheated, but God didn't allow it. And the reason I'm saying God didn't allow this because he appeared to me, and he reminded me of what was said in Bethel. So again, let me provide this clarification. This is not saying that this is a local God. When He says, The God of Bethel, he's referencing that experience. He's reminding Jacob that I am the same God that made the promises to you in Bethel. And just as I promised to be with you now see how I am being with you. I am the God of Bethel. He says in verse 13, where you anointed a pillar and made a vow to me. Now Arise, go out from this land and return to the land of your kindred. That's what God said would happen. I will give this land to you, and I will bring you back to this land. God is the same God. When He promises something it is sure to happen. And we know that because God is a faithful God. This year, we are talking about being faithful stewards. Well, the greatest example we have of faithfulness anywhere is our great God. God never relents, are relaxes his promise he never goes back on his word. God never fails to deliver what he wants to deliver for. God is a God of faithfulness. In First Timothy had mentioned something the fact that that if we deny Him if we are to change if we are not faithful, God will still be faithful, regardless of who we are. God is One And that is always faithful. God is a God of faithfulness. And he reminds Jacob that he reminds Jacob of that, in this passage, I am the same God, the God of Bethel, the same God that stated that he would be with you. So he's in Haoran, but he's making his way back. Okay, so as he comes back, we're going to see another episode at Bethel. So open your Bibles to Chapter 35 Chapter 35. And I'll just mention to fill in a little bit of the story and chapter 32 and 33 we see that, that Jacob as he comes back, you remember the beginning of the story, there is turmoil and strife with Esau 132 and 33, we see a reconciliation, okay, that rise and fall of the text, that literary device that we see there. So in chapter 34, we see that Jacob as he's coming into Canaan comes to Shechem. And there's a great problem that occurs in in Shackleton, and that is, you see an individual named shechen that takes Dinah and defiles her now there ends up being a marriage and and we're gonna see that Dinah's brothers and these are all sons of Jacob actually murdered the whole town. So and retribution or to get back at the people, there's a lot of, of bad things that happen there is they overreact, and are injustice and their reaction to the injustice. And so as we see that they come back to Shechem, that kind of leads us in to 35, as Jacob leaves shekel, okay, he's going to continue further south. So notice, if you would 35 and starting in verse one, God said to Jacob, Arise, go up to Bethel, and dwell there, make an altar there to the God who appeared to you when you fled from your brother Esau. So Jacob said to his household, and to all who are with him, put away the foreign gods that are among you, and purify yourselves and change your garments, then let us arise and go up to Bethel so that I may make them an altar to the God who answers me in the day of my distress, and has been with me wherever I have gone. So they gave to Jacob all the foreign Gods that they had and the rings that were in their ears, Jacob hid them under the tariff tree that was near shekel.

Jeremy Sweets  22:42
And as they journeyed a terror from God fell upon the cities that were around them, so that they did not pursue the sons of Jacob. And Jacob came to Luz, that is Bethel, which is in the land of Canaan, he and all the people who are with him. And there he built an altar, and called the place el Bethel, because there God had revealed Himself to him when he fled from his brother, and Deborah Rebecca's nurse died and she was buried under an oak below Bethel. So we call its name a lon, but couth God appeared to Jacob again when he came from Patton Moran and blessed him. And God said to him, your name is Jacob No longer shall your name be called Jacob, but Israel shall be your name. So he called his name Israel. And God said to him, I am God Almighty, Be fruitful and multiply, a nation and accompany of nation shall come from you. And king shall come from your own body, the land that I gave to Abraham and Isaac, I will give to you, and I will give the land your offspring after you. Then God went up from him in the place where he had spoken with him, and Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he had spoken with him a pillar of stone, he poured out a drink offering on it and poured oil on it. So Jacob called the name of the place where God had spoken with him, Bethel, Bethel. You'll see often in Genesis that altars are made as a way to worship God and worship the Lord. And usually they come as a freewill offering. That means that they are initiated by the worshiper. This is the only place that I'm aware where God directs someone to build an altar. And it's almost as if God is reminding Jacob, remember the vow that you may remember that you promise to return to me or to give back to me? Remember that I have rocked you back to this land. And so here we see this reminder that Jacob receives as he comes to worship the Lord. Well, notice that we see more about this God of Bethel. In verse two as he is told to Gries and go to Bethel and make an alter. What does Jacob immediately do? In verse two? It says, So do Jacob said to his household, and to all who are with him, put away the foreign gods that are among you, and purify yourselves and change your garments. What did Jacob recognize and realize about God, if he was to go before God, he recognized the need for holiness. He recognized the need for purity. And he did that because God is a holy God. God is a pure God. And we dare not go before God flippantly or flaunting our sin or flood flaunting a disregard for who he is, Jacob recognize if I'm going to go before God, I need to put away idols. First of all, there is one God over heaven and earth, the Lord God of heaven. And if we have idols, we need to put those away from ourselves. We also need to purify ourselves, Iraqi recognize that his sons had committed really, really mass murder of a city. And there was a need for purifying, not only in an outward sense, but their hearts as they came before God, their hearts were not right before him. He also says that we need to change our garments, change our garments. Now I have to tell you, this was one of the memory verses for the class that I taught. And this verse is fascinating to me, this started out being my sermon, and then it kind of grooves you still may get a sermon just on this passage. But it's fascinating to look at, and to think about what is necessary if we are to approach God, he says, We need to have a singular focus on God and who he is put away idols, put away the distractions, put away those that would detour our heart. He says that you need to purify yourselves, sin and God do not match. We cannot come before God in a sinful way, flaunting our sin and expect him to acceptance, we come before Him in humility, asking for forgiveness from our sins. And so we see this need for purity. And I believe he's particularly talking about one that that already had a relationship here with God. Then he also says that they need to change their garments. And that's an interesting phrase, in part, the garments that they may have been wearing were those that were looted from the city that was there. And so the garments may have been a reminder of the wickedness that had taken place.

Jeremy Sweets  27:38
It may be simply a reminder of the land that they left, a lot of times we wear the garments of the world. And so when I see this passage, and think about the meaning for us, and what's involved, a lot of times we are influenced by the world, we look like the world, we look and act like them. And that can be seen here in this visual representation of clothing. Well, Christians are to be different. We have a different mindset, we have a different direction in our life, we serve a different Master, we serve God Almighty, we don't serve ourselves. We don't do what we please, we do what God please. And so we seek to follow after Him and live after him. And so it's incompatible to follow after a holy God and yet put on the clothes of society, and yet put on the attitudes, the actions of those that have no interest in God. And so we need to remove those cultural clash, cultural trappings, first drawn to 15 says, Do not love the world, nor the things in the world. Let us be a people that that focuses on God, and being different. We don't try to be different for different sake. But by serving God and putting him first in our hearts, we will automatically be different. And we must guard against the desire and the temptation to be like the nations around us to be like the people that we see around us. Because we cannot. We cannot do that without compromising our faith and trust in God. Something has to go if we're going to look like the world and yet say we're following God, one of those two has to give. And so if we're going to put on the clothing of society, then our devotion to God will have to slip we'll have to allow things to be compromised. And so maybe I preached my whole lesson that I was going to there. It's a wonderful passage, and Jacob recognized that God of Bethel was a god of holiness. And so he prepared, he prepared for that holiness as he came before him. Notice in verses 11, and 1211, and 12, God said to him, I am God Almighty, Be fruitful and multiply a nation and accompany a nation shall come from you and king shall come from your own body. Here we see that God is a God of power. Now, this is the perfect thing to complement what we've seen already, that God is one that promises. God is not only one that promises but he is able to deliver. He's a God of almighty power and strength, and he says that I will multiply you, I will cause your offspring to grow. He is a God of power. We also see that he is a God who produces change. Notice in verse 10. God said to him, your name is Jacob no longer show your name be called Jacob, but Israel shall be your name. This is the second time that Jacobs name was renamed. And so God is confirming what we see already in chapter 32, and 33. There, and the end of 32, as Jacob wrestles with God, I think, as we've seen this journey from from Kanan to pat him around and back, we see the God that that Jacob worships. But I think we also see that Jacob matures. And Jacob groves This is evidence for example, in chapter 32, and verses nine through 12. Jacob was known for known for his his skill at at

Jeremy Sweets  32:03
wisdom is not the right word, but he was one that was true. That's the word I'm looking for. He was one that was shrewd in his dealings. And in chapter 32, as he faced his fears of Esau and dealing with Esau, here we see in this passage that, in my mind, as I look at this, he fully relied on God. And I think that was a point of growth for him, not that he had never had faith in God. But there is a full reliance in his words, and chapter 32, verses nine through 12. Allow me to read those. And the context is, is, as he fears Esau, he's not yet reconciled, and he doesn't know how that's gonna go. And Jacob said, oh, god of my father, Abraham, and God in my father, Isaac, oh Lord, who said to me, return to your country into your Kandra, that I may do you good. I am not worthy of the least of all the deeds of steadfast love and all the faithfulness that you have shown to your servant, for with only my staff, I crossed the Jordan and now I have become two camps. Please deliver me from the hand of my brother from the hand of Esau, for I fear Him, that He may come and attack me, the mothers with the children. But you said, I will surely do you good, and make your offspring as the sand of the sea, which cannot be numbered, for for multitude. Jacob expresses his unworthiness, and he recalls God's promises and falls upon His grace and mercy. God You had promised this and he puts his trust and belief in Him, we see that Jacob was one I think that grew and changed. And so with the name change, there was that represented in part, I believe, a change from one that grasped and was shrewd, one that was intelligent and trying to figure things out to full dependence here, as illustrated in this passage, God can produce change. That's not only true with Jacob, but it's also true with us. Now I've focused on who God is this God of Bethel, but I hope you've been able to see as we've studied these things, that when we truly know who God is that demand something of a US. If God is a God of promise and provision, let us be a people that give thanksgiving for those provisions. If God is a God of all, let us be impressed with who God is, let us recognize his awesome nature. If God is a God of a personal relationship, let us seek that relationship, knowing that he is the master of the universe and we need his care. If he is the god of care and protection let us rely on him in times of distress in times of trouble. If God is a faithful God, let us rely upon His faithfulness and seek to be faithful ourselves. If God is holy, let us put sin away from us and seek to respect and honor his character and his holiness. If God is the God of power, let us again rely upon his power. Let us pray and pray often knowing that he is strong enough to deliver us. And if God is one that can produce change, when we are faced with sinfulness in our lives when we are faced with, with something that we need to change, let us be pliable. Let us have soft and tender hearts, so that we would be willing to change. We want to align ourselves with God's will, and do what he would have us to do. We're going to be singing an invitation song. And this invitation song comes from God Himself, He is inviting you to the very gospel message that is proclaimed in Scripture, the Gospel messages that Jesus died on the cross for you and for me, he died in order to take our sins away. We must believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living God must have faith in who he is, as the Son of God, we must repent of our sins and turn away from a lifestyle of selfishness and sin, and to turn to a lifestyle of service to Him. We must confess that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living God, and we must be baptized in order to wash away our sins, being raised to walk in newness of life. That's the opportunity that we have. That's the gospel message. And it's a great message. As a Senator, we can have our sins washed away and we can be His child. There's a lot of lessons we can learn from Jacob and the God of Bethel. So let's implement those things. There's anybody here that subject to the invitation, please come as we stand and sing at this time.
