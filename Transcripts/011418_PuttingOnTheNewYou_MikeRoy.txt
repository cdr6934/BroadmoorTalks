Well, it's a new year, just started here just in the last couple of weeks new beginning, think new goals we have. We've challenged each of us here at Broadmoor to be faithful stewards of all that God has entrusted us with. Maybe new construction at some point. Keep working in that direction. But the Bible has a lot to say about being renewed in the spirit of our minds. In Christ, we are new creatures. So the simple fact that the New Year is upon us. Let's think about just leaving the past failures and frustrations and shortcomings and disappointments behind us. Let's leave, leave all that behind us, and press onto the goal of being Christ like in every aspect of our lives. That's the goal that we are shooting for. Appreciate the songs that Kevin led this morning that will go along with the lesson appreciate the words of Jeremy at the Lord's Supper as we realize that our forgiveness is found there. And our goal is to become like Jesus Christ. And all that we do. A text that I want to look at this morning is from Ephesians chapter four. And really, verses 22 through 24. And by way of the title of the lesson take really taken right from this text, I want to challenge us, each one of us to do as this text is telling us to put on the new you the new person, the old person is dead, we've died to sin, we need to continue to die to sin. We'll talk about that in the lesson this morning. But that's the challenge

Mike Roy  01:33
that the old this last year is behind us. We've all had shortcomings, disappointments, fears, and failures and all whatever setback we might have had. But let's leave that behind us. And let's put on the new person in a new year. I think God gives us a new year and new weeks because we need a sense of refreshment and renewal. And so I want to be looking at this text this morning in Ephesians chapter four, and verses 12. And look at verses 20 through 24. just mentioned. As I was looking over, I get different emails from different sources and Bible messages. And I was looking at the passage in Ephesians chapter four I think this early this week, and it struck me how God's word just naturally outlines itself for us and gives us some relevant message. But notice with me, and Ephesians chapter form and read that then we'll get into the lesson I've got four simple points that I want us to glean from this text. And it really comes right from the text. The notice in Ephesians chapter four, actually just come through in verse 17. Paul says this, I say and affirm together with the Lord, that you no longer walk, that you walk no longer just as the Gentiles also walk in the futility of their mind, being dark in their darkened in their understanding, excluded from the life of God because of the ignorance that is in them, because of the hardness of their heart. And they haven't and they haven't become callous have given themselves over to sensuality, for the practice of every kind of impurity with greediness. But you do not learn Christ in this way, if indeed you have heard him and have been taught in him, just as truth is in Jesus, that in reference to your former manner of life, you lay aside the old self, which has been corrupted in accordance with the lust of the seat, and that you'd be renewed in the spirit of your mind. And put on the new South, which in the likeness of God has been created in righteousness and holiness of the truth. So this is a text that we want to look at this morning. And I want you to just see this. And again, notice how God's word is so plain as he reveals his will to us and offices challenges. So when you look at a passage like this, what is Paul's telling us that we need to be thinking about? He says, that we he tells us that we are to put off our old self, we are the the old self has has been corrupted by his deceitful desires. This is the NIV. And then he says that we need to be made new and the attitude of our minds. That's that renewal idea. And then ultimately, verse 24, we're to put on the new self that is created to be like God, and true righteousness and holiness. So you look at this passage, there's four basic points that come out to me, that I want to talk about with you this morning, as we have embarked on a new year, and we have new opportunities before us. But these are some very practical things that Paul is setting before us. So it's the kind of thing that we need to be reminded of, from time to time. So the first point I want us to notice then, is that as a follower of Jesus Christ, we need to put put off that old person that I just made reference to there and on the screen that in reference to former Manor blood, you lay aside the old self. So that's the biblical charge for each one of us. us to get rid of the former manner of life put off that old, that old person. That is we put off the old thought patterns, old habits, old practices, we get rid of them. As we've been studying in our class on Wednesday night and the Sermon on the Mount, if our right eye offends the offense us or our right hand, we

Mike Roy  05:18
pluck it out, we cut it off, and then we throw it far from us. So we as followers of Christ, put off the old person. And we, we lead, let leave that behind. So again, in a practical way, thinking about the past year, whatever failures we've had, we all have them, leave them behind there, put this stuff up, put those thoughts out of your mind. And as I need to put those things out of my mind, again, I think of a statement that Paul made in second Corinthians chapter four, verse two, he says that we have renounced the hidden things of shame. So it's not just tolerating sin, we're not thinking about it, Paul says, We have renounced those things, we have turned away from the life that we once lived. We don't live that way any longer. But notice in verse 20, of this text of Ephesians, chapter four, Paul said, but you did not learn crisis where he's talking about the, the greediness the the last and all the sinfulness that he's describing in the in the life of these Gentiles. He said, You didn't learn Christ. That way, learning about Jesus and hearing about him and being taught in Him in verse 21, means that we leave the old person behind us, we get rid of that person, we bury that dead person, we're not going to be alive to those things any longer. So it's a reminder, I think, for all of us, that as we have. When we obeyed the gospel, we put to death, that old person, the reality is that we died to send once we have to die to sin on a regular basis. Paul said, in fact, in First Corinthians chapter 15, and verse 31, I die daily. And maybe he's saying I faced death daily for the cause of Christ, but he's talking about daily, dying to himself, to self preservation, to self protection, and all that to comfort, all that stuff. I died daily. And so as a follower of Christ, we going to put off that old person. And again, we did that in a big way. I certainly did when I came out of the world, almost 40 years ago, but we have to continually do that. So Paul reminds us that as followers of Jesus Christ, we must put off the old person. And reality sometimes that old person creeps back into our minds my way of thinking, my attitude. So why do we take off, put off the old person? Well, text tells us secondly, that the old person has been corrupted by our deceitful desires. That's why we put off the old person's because the way that we lived outside of Christ was a way of corruption and sinfulness and pollution, we were contaminated by sin. We gotta get rid of that. So Paul says that the old person has been corrupted by our deceitful desires. The New Living trade translation puts it this way, which is corrupted by lust and deception. The New King James Version and puts it this way, which grows corrupt according to the deceitful laws. And so this verse I think, is reminding us that we put off the old person fundamentally because it living that way is harmful to ourselves. We have been corrupted because of sin. I'm gonna be going a little longer live that way. But one of the things that this verse reminds us of is the deceptive nature of sin, the deceptive nature of lust, the deceptive nature of evil desire. Again, these desires that we have make promises to us that they cannot deliver. And for example, last and he's even greed promises some level of pleasure and satisfaction but it actually delivers emptiness. These things promise happiness, but the they deliver misery and are so are evil desires deceive us, think about this with me, our desires, our evil desires deceive us. And even when we listen to them is even in Genesis chapter three, when we listen to our evil desires and pursue them, they destroy us. We think we're smarter than that, right? Human nature shows that we oftentimes give in to those things. So the we put off the old person, because the old person is full of corruption. We don't want that to be a characteristic of our life. Look up. Paul said in First Timothy chapter six, and verse 10. Beginning verse nine, knows what Paul says about the desire to be rich and we have to be on guard we live in a wealthy Land, Jeremy talks about that we

Mike Roy  10:02
realize we are well off and by the world standards even if we don't have what others have around us. But look at the warnings that Paul gives over here. And verse nine, he said, but those who desire to be rich, listen up. Those who desire to make a lot of money, get rich fall into temptation into a snare. A snare is a trap. And the trap gets you like the animal get has his foot in a trap, it cannot get out. Those who desire to get rich to be rich, fall into temptation into temptation into a snare into many senseless and harmful desires, that listen, plunge people into ruin, and destruction. That's the nature of sin. It deceives us, it catches us, and then it ultimately can kill us if we're not on our guard. And then in verse 10, he says, For the love of money, the love not money. Sometimes you hear phrases, though money is the root of all evil. It's not. It is not the root of all evil, the love of money, the desire for money, the hunger and thirst for money, were supposed to hunger and thirst for righteousness. But the hungry and thirsting for money may kill you, may cost you your soul. But me too, for the love of money is a root of all kinds of evil. It is through this craving, like how the ESV puts it, it is through this craving that some have wandered away from the faith and pierced themselves with many pains. So, again, Paul is reminding us in Ephesians chapter four, that we put off the old person because it has been corrupted by deceitful desires, that as much as we preach about it and talk about it, how often do we get deceived and pursue our own desires, because we think it's going to give some level of satisfaction, or whatever it might be. Paul reminds us that we've been that the old person has been corrupted by deceitful desires, and we want to be be on guard against that and leave that type of lifestyle behind us. So again, you look at this text is very plain to us. As a follower of Christ, we're going to put off that old person, because that old person has been corrupted by these desires. The third point I want us to think about in this Texas morning, is to understand that spiritual renewal begins in our hearts and our minds appreciate again, the songs that Kevin led for us this morning, challenging us for that new life, a life of holiness and purity and righteousness and peace and all of that type of thing. So again, looking at the context over here, in verse 23, you said that you may be renewed in the spirit of your mind is what the New American Standard Version says. And I think I've got another one No, I don't look at there for just a minute. So he's telling these Christians dare to lay aside the old self, the old self has been corrupted in accordance with the lust of deceit or deceitful desires, and that were renewed in the spirit of our mind. It's a reminder that, that this spiritual renewal that we're talking about this morning begins in our heart and mind if we want a live a better quality life with pure thoughts and pure motives and serving God, that that spiritual renewal begins in our hearts and in our minds. So in Christ, we are a new creation. So again, think about this. From a very practical standpoint, as we come into a new year. Think about making changes to your thought patterns, changes to your habits, changes to lifestyle, changes to your old selfish, fearful, anxious, greedy, whatever way of thinking that can be in the hearts and minds of each one of us. And so what I'm saying is that it brethren, we are capable of new beginnings. We can renew our hearts, renew our mind, renew our spirit. If last year was a struggle, this year can be better. If last year you were in the pit so to speak this year, you can be on the mountain top but it's choice. Its accent is filling our hearts and minds with God's word change is possible. But for most for many of us, we sometimes think change is not part of like I'm never changed my way of thinking I won't change my habits my way of living but change is possible. I still remember as a young man, I was selling books with that to the southwestern company thing Sarah worked there years ago, a couple of years ago and I was working with Frank Walton and under Christian up in the Iowa and Illinois area. Tough I mean door knocking this is a summer job to help pay tuition, that type of thing is hard job knocking

Mike Roy  14:49
on doors, cold calling. And I used to listen to Zig Ziglar as motivational messages to the head and but one of those thoughts is still in my mind. That's a long time ago. He said, you can change who you are, you can change what you are by changing what you put into your mind. And too, oftentimes we put wrong thoughts, thoughts of defeat, thoughts of inadequacy, thoughts of fear, thoughts of worry, all those things permeate our mind, but you change who you are. By changing what you put into your mind is proactive living is not something that you do overnight. But you can do a little bit every day, small change, even small, gradual, daily change a year from now can result in significant change in your life and in in the direction of your life, living with more faith and more trust, as you seek a point of renewal. So many times we're beaten down because of our failures or poor decisions. Sometimes there's health issues, but it's just very often wrong decisions, wrong attitudes, living with maybe a sense of inadequacy, and we think we'll never get out of this rut. You can do all that stuff. I want you to look at this passage with me and Isaiah, chapter 43. Israel are God's people due to going into Babylonian captivity, right? terrible situation, terrible circumstances. How do you live? Well, if you're serving under Nebuchadnezzar, or Artaxerxes, or whoever it may be. And so this was the promise that God has makes to his people in captivity, and it may be a prediction of what he's going to do. He said, Remember, not the former things, don't think about all the stuff in the past nor consider the things of old, Behold, I am doing a new thing. Now it springs forth, do you not perceive it? I will make a way in the wilderness. How do you not navigate in the wilderness unless you're in a tank, right? You can't make your way in the wilderness, the trees, the hills, the valleys can't do that. God said, I'll make a way for you in the wilderness. And he says, I'll make rivers in the desert. How many deserts have rivers in them? Well, God says if I want to put a river in a desert, I will I just looked at some images online just to see a little river coming. But the whole area may be arid and dry. But God can put water anywhere, anywhere he wants to. And here's another one over here. And the point that I'm making here from this, these images in his chapter, Isaiah chapter 43, extols God's love, and His care for his people who were consistently, constantly disobedient to him. And yet they were still his people, still his nation. And he's going to demonstrate to the world and to his people, that he is still there loving Holy God, who will deliver them against great odds and bring them back from captivity. They're in the pits. So literally, and they are maybe at the point of hopelessness. But with God, there is hope. Today is a new day, I can live better today than I did yesterday. And even if I'm dealing with terrible thought patterns, and whatever it may be, or terrible past, I can come out of that. God says, I'll make streams in the desert. Wow, that's amazing. And so it's a reminder that our Lord is a God of new opportunities. And so in this situation with with Judah in captivity, God's going to take a Gentile King Cyrus, we talked about him this morning. And he's going to use Cyrus to defeat another Gentile King Nebuchadnezzar, we talked about him this morning, and rescue his people, because they're still his people. And he's still very God, and he is still a holy God.

Mike Roy  18:45
And so, again, it's a reminder that God can take us through the darkest hours of our struggles and bring us into a new type of life, a new way of living. To take an illustration from Ezekiel chapter 37, he can take dead dry bones and make them come to life again, is equal chapter 37. Read about the vision of the valley of dry bones, God can breathe life into dead bones. If God can do that he can he can give a spiritual renewal and don't care how far you've been going down the wrong path, or whatever the the issues that you struggle with, or any of us struggle with. God can transform you and me as we sung this morning some of these songs from our old fleshly ways to live with a new holy way of thinking. Sometimes I don't think it's possible. But it is possible, because God can make streams spring up in the desert rivers in the desert. So that's the one of the messages in Scripture, that God is a God of newness, new beginnings. You've made mistakes in the past, you've had failures in the past, you've had struggles in the past. God can make a river flow through the desert. He can infuse life into dead bones. That means that he can bring great change into your life and into my life. Paul talks about that in the in Romans chapter 12, verses one and two, we said, I appeal to you, therefore brothers by the mercies of God, that you present your bodies as a living sacrifice, wholly unacceptable to God, which is your spiritual worship. Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewal of your mind that by testing what that by testing, you may discern what is the will of God, what is good and acceptable and perfect. And so, you'd look at this passage over here and check Romans chapter 12, verses one and two, Paul reminds these Christians that they are not to be conformed to the world, their formal way of living and thinking perhaps, but be transformed. By the renewal of your mind, Brennan we can change who we are, we can change what we are by renewing our mind and daily thinking about God's word. So in this new year, again, let's take a very simplistic approach to this lesson this morning in this new year, brethren, let's renew our faith to renew our hope of heaven. let's renew our love for God for His Word, and for one another. let's renew our minds. by immersing our hearts in God's holy word. I hope that you are on a reading a Bible reading schedule. We stressed that a lot at Broadmoor. And for many years, I've used one that Gary Henry had furnished to me but I finally with my smartphone decided to use one off that that gives me a daily reading from you know, the Old Testament law, some of the prophets or the wisdom literature, except like for second and finally come to the Gospels. And so whatever we got it, that's one way that we get renewed, constantly filling our hearts and minds with God's holy words, or reading God's word is essential to your spiritual well being. It's not just reading God's word. The other thing that we don't talk about a lot, and maybe even have a hard time getting our arms around that is meditating, meditating on God's word, thinking about that over and over in our minds till it finally transforms our thinking. I think another great tool of renewal is what I'm calling fervent, personal, private prayer. Prayer, collectively is wonderful. We need to do that together. But if you're, if you want real strength, and real renewal, do what Jesus did just get away from the busy schedule that you have, and spend time with God in prayer. And I look at this context. And Mark chapter one, verses 30 to 35, says that, that that evening at sundown, they brought to him all who were sick or pressed by demons, and the whole city was gathered together at the door. And he healed many who were sick with various diseases and cast out many demons. And he would not permit the demons to speak because they knew him. So Jesus is just constantly confronted with masses of people effect in Mark chapter six, I think in verse 31, it says, so many were coming and going, they didn't even have time to eat. Are you busy than Jesus? Are you busy then Jesus and his disciples? I don't think so. He's very, very busy. What did he do is he got his day started,

Mike Roy  23:30
said in verse 35, and rising very early in the morning, while it was still dark, and I'm still sleeping, he departed in went out to a desolate place, that desert area embarr, he prayed. He refused. He received power from on high from his father, that intimate communion. And we need to recognize that Brennan, sometimes we don't give personal, private, intimate prayer with God the priority that we need to and I know the challenges, especially you folks with young children, it is hard. It is very hard. But this what Jesus did, he's our example. So before he faced the masses of people, and the questions from his disciples, Lord, you're gonna restore the Kingdom at this time. And, Lord, should we bring rain fire down on this village because they didn't receive it, Lord, and He is bombarded with all these people. He got up while everybody was sleeping, left his house went out into the desert. And he prayed there, wow, what an example. And so if we need some spiritual renewal, certainly, that is something that we can do as well. But the fourth point that we want to notice from this text, this text this morning, again, very simply reveals what God wants us to do, that we ultimately in this renewal process, we die to ourselves, we leave the old person dead, we lay aside that old person, because it's corrupt. is sinful and we've been deceived by it. And then ultimately, through this renew, we put on the very holiness, purity and righteousness of God. And so in verse 24, is impulses into put on the new self, created after the likeness of God and true righteousness and holiness. So when you look at this passage in Ephesians, chapter four, it's a reminder to us that our goal in this renewal is to put on the very character of God, the very character of Jesus Christ, we've been talking about that in our class on Wednesday night. That's the goal of following Jesus teaching, not to just do certain rules or actions and to do this checklist mentality that we sometimes do, we're striving to become like God, like Jesus Christ, Christ in every essential way. And so that means we want to partake of His holiness, His purity, His justice, His mercy, His kindness, and his love. There's a song that we sometimes saying, oh, to be like the blessed Redeemer, this is my constant longing and prayer, gladly all forfeit all of Earth's treasures, Jesus by perfect likeness, to where, wow, we can wear the likeness of Jesus Christ. And that's what Paul was saying to do, that ultimately, through this renewal process, death itself, continual death itself, we put on the very holiness, purity in righteousness as righteousness of God. And that something that is attainable. And maybe you say, well, in the past year, I kind of fell short of that. Well, we all do and did. But the reality is we can we can move in that direction. Somebody said that better is the new perfect been talking to a dietitian recently, I'm trying to lose some weight. Not been very successful so far. But anyways, he made that statement that better is the new perfect, and the idea is that you just do better. If I can do a little bit better today than I did yesterday. That's progress. And we realized that we can partake of God's holiness. And we have we have to work in that direction. Luke, chapter six, verse 39, and 40 tells us and about this, in verse 39, he says, he also told them a parable can a blind man lead a blind man, while they're not both fall into a pit, so that disciple is not above his teacher, but everyone when he is fully trained will be like his teacher.

Mike Roy  27:39
We can be Christ like, and I trust that we are becoming more and more Christ like through that process, but we have to be trained in that process. And also one of the passage before we bring the lesson to close this morning, second Corinthians chapter three, verse 18. Paul, again, is telling us what we do as Christians through our worship of God and reading His word. If we were not like the the Jews in the Old Testament, and when Moses spoke to them, they had to put a veil over his face and said, We with unveiled face beholding the glory of the Lord, what happens and he's a pastor that we've looked at what happens when you behold the glory of the Lord, it changes you. And we are changed. When we see God's glory in Scripture. When we come together in worship, with there's even a certain level of emotion that we experienced when you walk on God's mountains on us or you sail on the seas. You also impressed by that. But Paul says, beholding the glory of the Lord are being transformed into the same image. I can, I'm like God, you are like God, like Jesus Christ, from one degree of glory to another for this comes from the Lord, who is the spirit. And so let's what Paul is saying here is that, ultimately, in this renewal process, in this new year, we can set a goal of becoming just like God to be transformed into His very image and likeness. You think in Genesis chapter one, verses 26 and 27, God made man in His own likeness, he made a male and female. And so in Genesis chapter one he of God's creation is made just like him and then the fall. And then ultimately, when it comes to the Bible, and to the book of Revelation, the Paradise was lost in Genesis paradise is restored. And ultimately God's goal is for us to be transformed into the very image of Jesus Christ. And so that is our goal is to be like Jesus Christ, but that requires a lot of training requires a lot of Bible study and meditation, lots of prayer, and much time spent in worship to God. I say this, with some frequency worship is transforming has a transforming effect upon us. We don't stress the importance of being in the assembly on Sunday. Morning or a Sunday night or in being in Bible study, just because that's something that we want to do. It changes who you are from the inside out. And so as we come into the new year, that's the question for us to think about. Are you putting on the new you? Are you still living the old way? The old man that is characteristic so many times in our lives? Are you putting on the new you the new person in this new year? Well, if you're not a Christian, if you haven't obeyed the gospel of Jesus Christ, then you can't have that real sense of newness unless you're born again. That's why scripture talks about not just receiving Jesus as a savior, it means that we we die to ourselves, and we're completely reborn to death to sin. And ultimately, that means that our faith leads us to the point of repentance, and then a willingness to obey God's command to be immersed in water. That's part of the rebirth process. If you haven't done that, we urge you to do that before it's eternally too late. Maybe that you need just need a prayer to this congregation as you seek to be that new person in this new year if there's any need that you have this morning might come down to the front while we stand and sing this invitation song
