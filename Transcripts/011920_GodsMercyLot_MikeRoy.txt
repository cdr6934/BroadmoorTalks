is always so good to have an opportunity to come and worship our God to praise Him and to seek to become more like Him, I realize and trust that all of us do that the New Year is upon us. And I trust that we're going to keep our eyes focused on Jesus in 2020, with clear vision, not being distracted by the world. And if that's a constant challenge for me, I'm sure that it is for you as well to help us keep our minds focused on Jesus Christ in 2020. I hope that for one thing that you have chosen a daily Bible reading program, it is so helpful to keep our minds focus where it needs to be. And recently, I've been reading or actually listening through the book of Genesis and a program that I'm on. And I was once again, amazed at the account of Lot. It was just unbelievable description of the struggles. But in the in that context, I also saw how much grace and mercy was extended to lot on a really continued basis. And maybe if you've been reading through the book of Genesis, and even with our reading this morning, from Genesis shift 18, this was very difficult times in LA to get himself into a real bad situation. And God rescued him. But I was struck with the amount of mercy and grace that God gave lot. And less we think that lot receive too much mercy in his life, I hope you realize that we too, have been the recipients of God's abundant grace and mercy. And so my lesson this morning, is titled, God's extreme mercy for lot. So we're gonna be looking at the Old Testament, and this is not a conventional lesson that I often do. But I'm going to basically be focusing our my talk this morning on the account of law, and we'll be looking at some of the passages but mainly be looking at Genesis chapter 19. We just read ship 18, this morning, Mark, good.

Mike Roy  02:14
But in Genesis, chapter 19, details the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah, God incinerated his place to ashes. So we're gonna be this could be really the text of our lesson this morning, they'll have been on the screen, we'd look briefly at Genesis chapter 13, which is the background leading up to why a lot got himself into Saddam, and all that stuff. But we're going to begin quickly by looking at Second Peter chapter two, because there's a commentary on lot in this passage by Peter that is helpful. So I'll get this up on the the screen. So in Second Peter chapter two, and verses five through nine is talking about the fact that God did not spare the ancient world he destroyed it. But he preserved Noah herald of righteousness with seven others, when he brought a flood upon the world of the ungodly. And if by turning the cities of Sodom and Gomorrah to ashes, he condemned them to extinction, making them an example of what was going to happen or is good to happen to the ungodly. And if he rescued righteous, lat, greatly distressed by the sensual conduct of the wicked. For as that righteous man lived among them day after day, he was tormenting his righteous soul over their lawless deeds that he saw and heard, then the Lord knows how to rescue the godly from trials, and to keep the unrighteous under punishment until the day of judgment. But this brief text and Second Peter chapter two is telling us a couple things over here, he's saying that God, punish is those that are given to sin, he brought a flood upon the world of the ungodly. So God punishes sin. And He punishes sinners. But the but God knows how to rescue the righteous, imperfect, though we may be. And that's the point that he's making over here. That law was in the midst of a cesspool of sin. That's hard to even relate to in our culture, but God rescued lot. And the point he's making here is that if God could rescue a lot, then the Lord knows how to rescue the godly from their trials and temptations. And so we focus on that the truth that God rescued lot in the midst of incredible sin and moral degradation that he was surrounded with. And the point is, again, maybe want to make it again, is to simply say no matter what trials or temptations I am wrestling with, or you are wrestling with. God is able to deliver you from that he's able to deliver me from that he delivered A lot, he rescued lot, and he can rescue you and me. So let's go back to the Old Testament. Now to get our context here. I'm going to begin by looking at Genesis chapter 13. Just make a comment to before we get into the text, but lot in Genesis chapter 13, I'll put that up on the screen in just a moment, focused on the well watered plane of Jordan to live and to raise his family. And he seemed to ignore the danger of living so close to the people of Saddam. And it seems that he chose where he was going to live or bring his family I'm not sure where he was at. And that was that in that process, but based on physical property, physical characteristics, physical prosperity. So this is the background leading up to Genesis chapter 18, in Genesis chapter 90, which is really a text this morning. So in Genesis chapter 13, what's happening? Abraham said the lot, there was so much prosperity there and said, Please let there be no strife between you and me. Know, between my herdsmen and your herdsmen, for we are brothers is not the whole land before you. Please separate from me if to the left and I will go to the right, or if to the right, and I will go to the left. And in verse 10, says that law lifted up his eyes and saw all the valley of the Jordan, that it was well watered everywhere. So Abraham says a lot, you choose where you want to go. And Abraham could have said, Hey, I'm the older guy here. I'm the senior representative. Let me make the decision. He said, let you choose where you want to live. And so a lot looks out there he saw the valley of the Jordan that's gonna come back later. And I text this morning, that it was well watered everywhere. It was like the garden of the Lord, like the land of Egypt as you go down to czar. So this was breathtakingly beautiful and plentiful. It was an amazing section of territory of land. And so when Abraham said a lot, you pick where you're going to live. And he looked at this well watered valley in the Jordan area. And that's where he was going to take his family and move there. So again, he's making these decisions based on physical characteristics. He saw how beautiful the land and the land was, how fertile it was. Then a verse 11 says a lot chose for himself all the valley of the Jordan, in lot journey east were so they separated, they had too many cows and cattle and horses and all that stuff. The land couldn't contain them. And so a lot makes a journey to the valley of the Jordan. Thus they separated from each other. And Abraham settled in the land of Canaan, while a lot settled in the cities of the valley. Notice in the last part of verse 12, that lot moved his tents as far as Sodom.

Mike Roy  07:52
He pitched his tents to Assad was what the King James Version says. Verse 13, says, Now the men of Sodom were a wicked exceedingly in sinners against the Lord. What a terrible, tragic decision that Lot was making. But it was clearly his decision. He saw the gold he saw the silver, he saw the water, he saw the land, he saw all that stuff, but he didn't see was sick. It was seated right next to the most wicked people on Earth. That's where he chose to have his neighbors and live live close to. So we see. Genesis chapter 13, shows us how Lotte got himself into such a predicament, where God was going to rescue him and God repeatedly showed the mercy and the grace to lot. So we're gonna look at Genesis chapter 19. And I think I've got most of these verses up here that we're gonna be looking at not the entire chapter. But So Genesis chapter 90, this is about the doom of Solomon and and we just read this morning and Mark's reading, Abraham, God says, Am I gonna hide from Abraham, but I'm going to do surely I'm not going to do that, that he is going to destroy Sodom and Gomorrah and the cities all around because of their wickedness. And so Abraham has this dialogue with God said, Lord, because his nephew's living there. We'll find out. He's actually living inside of now. So he, Abraham says, Lord, you're not going to destroy this place for 50 righteous people, will you? Oh, no, I won't do that. What about 45? No, I won't do that. What about 40? No, I won't do that. What about 30? I won't do it. I want to destroy it for 30 What if you find 20 People I won't do it for that. What if you find 10 righteous people we destroyed the city? No, I won't. The reality is God could that dog could not find 10 righteous people in Sodom. Now notice over here in this context is we're gonna be focusing on again, I want you to see the mercy in the grace that God extended to lot so many times. But Genesis chapter 19 In verse one The two angels came to Saddam in the evening. And notice that Lot was sitting in the gate of Saddam. Remember, he pitched us tents toward Saddam. He was in the Jordan Valley, all that lush area. Now he's installed him in the city gates. What's one of God's people doing in a city gates of Sodom. That's where the decisions are made and judgments are made and businesses conducted lot is now in the city gates. Be careful where you live. Be careful who you get close to. Lot didn't intend I think to be inside them. But he pissed is tense toward Saddam, he found himself in a world of trouble. Human last saw them he rose to meet these angels about himself for this space to the earth and said, my lords, please turn aside to your servants house and spend the night and wash your feet, then you may rise up early and go on your way. They said no, we will spend the night in the town square. But he pressed them strongly. So they turned aside to him and entered his house. He made them a feasts and baked them bread, unleavened bread and they ate. So in this, this context, the angels are coming, warning lot about the impending destruction of Solomon. So could you continue to look at the account over here a lot, remember, and I should have focused on this and pointed this out in Second Peter chapter two, Lot was a righteous man. Law was a righteous man. But he made many wrong decisions at points of his life. So we, we see the situation over here, lots in the gate of sod and the angels come there, he tries to get them to come into the house. And they didn't want to do that. At first he pressed upon them. And they did do that. So notice over here, and in verse four, he said before they lay down, the men of the city, the men of Sodom surrounded the house, both young and old, all the people from every quarter, and they call to Lot and said to him, where are they? Where are the men who came to you tonight? Bring them out to us that we may have relations with them. The no New Living Translation says that we may have sex with them.

Mike Roy  12:11
But light went out to them at the doorway and shut the door behind him and said, Please, my brothers do not act wickedly. And now one of the most inexplicable statements you ever read in Scripture a lot said Now behold, I have two daughters who have not had relations with man, please let them let me bring them out to you. And do to them whatever you like, will never understand the rationale there. Only do nothing to these men is it as much as they have come under the shelter my roof. But they said stand aside. Furthermore, they said this man, or this one came in as an alien. And already he is acting like a judge. Now we will treat you worse than them. So they pressed hard against lotman they came near to break the door. These spider mites are trying to get into the house, to have a sexual relationship with the angels, the men that came in there. And last step outside the house, shut the door and says don't do this. My brothers, this is evil. This is wicked. Don't do this. Take my virgin daughters, again can't even understand any rationale for that. Apparently, that did not happen. And so now he's outside. And these guys are trying to literally break the door down lots of dead man. But what does it say over here. But the men reached out their hands and brought lot into the house with them and shut the door. God was merciful to Lot. lots out there trying to negotiate with these wicked people. And they're not listening. And they had rushed upon this house, trying to literally break the door down. And these angels pulled light back into the house. And then it says that they struck the man who were at the doorway of the house with blindness, both small and great. So that they wearied themselves trying to find the doorway a lot could have died, could have been destroyed right there. God's grace was upon him and that did not happen. And the angels came to the rescue brought him inside of the house and instruct these people outside with blindness so that they couldn't try to make any more advances. So again, we will see like a series of actions on God's part reflecting his mercy and grace towards lot. Now continue in the account. And chapter 19, verses 12 through 14 says then the two men said to Lord whom else have have you here a son in law and your sons and your daughters and whomever you have in a city bring them out of the place for we are about to destroy this place because they're outcries become so great before the Lord that the Lord has sent us to destroy it. What went out is spoke to his sons in law who have to marry his daughters and set up, get out of this place for the Lord will destroy the city. But he appeared to be to appear to his sons in law to be jesting. Now here's a dire warning. God says, I'm going to destroy this place you bidding it out right now. And Lot communicates this message to his sons in law, they thought he was joking, or jesting. And look at the account in verse 15. says, When morning dawn the angels, the angels earn a lot saying up, take your wife and your two daughters who are here, or you will be swept away in the punishment of the city, what would you do? If angels came to your house and say this is going to be incinerated? And one hour, you get one hour to get you have to get out right now? What would you do? You had go? What does the text say? But he hesitated. He's a dead man. He is a dead man. But by the grace of God, he has another opportunity to get out. So the text says, but he has it. Why did he hesitate? God's gonna rain fire and brimstone burning software on this city, in lat hesitated. It's hard to imagine. So what happens? You could have been dead, or what happens to the angels again. So the man sees his hand and the hand of his wife and the hands of his two daughters. Angel said here, get out. They took him by the hand law was stuck. He was he was not moving. And what was the motivation? It says over here for the compassion of the Lord was upon him.

Mike Roy  16:52
So the reason God extended this rescue for law is because he's a compassionate and loving God. So because the man sees his hand is in the hands of his wife, God's compassion is on him. And they brought him out and put him outside the city. So they literally pulled him out of Sodom to save his life. In the universe, everything when they brought them outside once said escape for your life, do not look behind you and do not stay anywhere in the valley, escape to the mountains, or you will be swept away. And again, the warning Get out, get out, get out, go to the mountains, get out of here go. And what does lots say again, I can't do it. I just can't do too far too hard. So then he says, oh, no, my lords. Now behold, your servant has found favor in your site. And you have magnified your loving kindness which you have shown me by saving my life. So lot realize how much grace and mercy God has shown him repeatedly. Now, one more time, the angels are saying get out of this place is going to be destroyed not just Sodom and Gomorrah, but the region of the valley and all the cities around gonna be incinerated, get out of here. And so he said, but I cannot escape to the mountains for disaster will overtake me and I will die. Now behold, this town is near enough to flee to and it is small, please let me escape there is it not small that my life may be spared? And so what are the angels say, Behold, I granted this request also not to overthrow the town of which you have spoken, hurry escaped there for I cannot do anything until you arrive there. Therefore the name of the town was called Zophar. So again, we sit we look at this, this text over here. And several times in this, this impending disaster in destruction. The angels are saying get out, get out, get out in lat hesitated. And then they finally pulled him out of the city. He's safe outside with his wife. They're saying go get out of here completely. He said, I can't make it that far. You've shown me loving kindness. Now let me go through a small city. That's just not too far down the road. And once again, the angels say okay, I grant you this request not to overthrow the town of which you have spoken. Wow. It's amazing how many times God showed mercy and grace, to law and to his family. So he's given that provision, he goes to the town of Zoa. And then the rest of the text will look over here make some applications, says verse 23. That the sun had risen on the earth when lot came to Tsar, and since then the LORD rained on Sodom and Gomorrah, sulfur and fire from the Lord out of heaven. And he overthrew those cities and all the valley and all the inhabitants of the cities in what grew on the ground. But Lot's wife behind him look back, I think longingly and she became a pillar of salt Abraham went early in the morning to the place where he still had stood before the Lord. And he looked down toward Sodom and Gomorrah and toward all the lands of the valley. And he looked and behold, the smoke of the land went up like the smoke of a furnace, it was still burning the next day, fire in flames and smoke still smoldering the next day. So verse 29. So it was that when God had destroyed the cities of the valley, God remembered Abraham, and sent lot out of the midst of the overthrow. Well, this is an interesting text. And this is simply a different type of lesson for me. But it made me think about a couple things. I want you to think about this with me as well. The question is, why was God so gracious and so merciful? To lat? Yes, he was a righteous man, but had repeatedly made bad decisions, poor decisions, put his family in jeopardy lost, his wife could have lost a lot more why was gone so gracious, and merciful to law. And my take on that is because that's who God is. That is his character. He is a gracious and merciful and loving God. Psalm chapter 145, Verse eight says this, The Lord is gracious and merciful, slow to anger, and great in loving kindness. So as I was listening to this, I'm doing that more now these days, as opposed to reading a Bible plan, just listening to it in a different translation. I was just struck at the amazing grace and mercy that God showed lot in the midst of terrible decisions, the kind of a stubbornness and hesitation, all that type of thing.

Mike Roy  21:51
But really, the I think the more important application is for us, why is the Lord so merciful and gracious to you and to me, you got to think about that. And you're not lot. But we're not that different from lot. And we need to realize that it's that God is gracious and merciful to me, and to you, in spite of our repeated stumbles and slips and failures, that we might find ourselves involved in the same weaknesses and sins, over and over, and over, and over, and over, and over and over and over and over and over again. And all I can say is, thank you, Lord for mercy. And as we resolved that we're not going to live a life of sin. Love that song that we sang this morning with healing in his swing, so often do I fall, and yet you rescue me, you lift me up, you strengthen me powerful song to think about. So understand this, and this lesson this morning, that lot,

Unknown Speaker  22:59
received a lot of mercy, a lot of grace from God, I

Mike Roy  23:05
think we've received even more. And you think that he made some bad decisions. I've made bad decisions in my life, too. And I still struggle to make the best decisions. And so it's a reminder of how much grace and mercy that God gives to each of us. And I think because we realize God is so gracious and merciful to us, certainly we need to extend mercy and grace to each other as we strive to be the kind of people that God wants us to be. But make no mistake as we wrap up the lesson this morning, God punishes sin. And last verse I want to look at this morning Acts chapter 17, verses 30 and 31. In the midst of all the idolatry in Athens and Mars Hill theory OPIC Is this what Paul said, Therefore, having overlooked the times of ignorance, so God actually overlooked the idolatry in some ways, overlook the times of ignorance, God is now declaring commend that all people everywhere should repent, because he has fixed the day in which he will judge the world in righteousness through a man whom he is appointed, having furnish proof to all men, by raising Him from the dead. The reason that the angels haven't blown the final trumpet, ushering the Day of Judgment is to give you in the opportunities to change your lives, to make our lives right with God to obey the gospel of Christ, and to continue to be committed to living the kind of lives that we should live in all holiness and purity and honesty. And yet we struggle we all do I do. You do we all struggle to be the kind of people that God wants to be, but understand, the Day of Judgment is coming. And God did finally rain software and software and on burning software on Sodom and Gomorrah and destroyed that city for this ends and we say Judgment Day has come is coming and God extends mercy grace for us, we can be free Given of our sins, in the means of that forgiveness comes about through Jesus Christ, we must believe that He is the Messiah. We must be willing to repent of sin. That's the hardest thing for us to do as humans, we must be willing to confess our faith in Him, and then submit the Gods command to be baptized. Because in baptism, when it's followed, following faith and repentance, God washes away all sins. And so if you haven't done that, you have to do that before the Day of Judgment. We're here to assist you in that to that endorphin. You need to praise this congregation for your own struggles, which we all have. We're here to encourage you and help you any way we can't. We invite you to come while we stand and sing this invitation song
