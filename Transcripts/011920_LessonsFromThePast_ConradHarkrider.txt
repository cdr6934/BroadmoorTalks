Do you want to open up your Bibles to Joshua chapter four?

Conrad Harkrider  00:25
Tonight's lesson is going to be a little bit different than what I typically do what others may typically do, in that I want to share with you some lessons from the past. Recently, we've been making an effort to do some clean out around our house, going through closets and things like that. And down in the garage, there's a couple of large brown boxes that belong to me. And I went down there the other day, and I grabbed one of those, it's pretty heavy, and I brought it up into the house. And I started taking everything out of the box and putting it on the floor. And my wife came into the room and she said, What are you doing? I said, Well, I thought we could go through this box together, and lay it out on the floor was all of various things from my childhood. And she took a look at all that stuff. And she said, I think your childhood needs to stay down in the garage.

Conrad Harkrider  01:25
But see, what she doesn't understand is that these are not just random things. These are precious artifacts, things like my old baseball jersey, and my first teddy bear, and that old harmonica that the kids have now taken possession of, and they love that thing. We can't have a conversation in the house anymore. But they've really enjoyed playing with it. But as I was going through all this stuff, seriously, the memories just start flooding back, looking at pictures, and seeing things from a time when I was younger. And so what I'd like to do is just show you a few pictures of things from the box and share with you a couple of lessons from the past. Thinking about the past is an important part of life. God gave us the ability to remember he gave us the ability to reflect. And reminisce, we're different from animals in that respect. And so thinking about what's happened in prior years, can help us give context for where we are today and where we're headed in the future. Look in Joshua, chapter four, as the children of Israel are getting ready to cross into the promised land. Joshua tells them that he wants them to take stones from the middle of the Jordan River. And he's going to set those stones up in Gilgal. On the other side of the Jordan, he says that there should be 12 men from one from each tribe that take one of these stones and bring them to the other side. And the purpose of those stones was to serve as a reminder for the people look at Joshua chapter four, and verse 21. It says, Then he spoke to the children of Israel saying, when your children ask their fathers in time to come, sing, what are these stones, then you shall let your children know saying Israel crossed over this Jordan on dry land, for the Lord your God dried up the waters of the Jordan before you until you had crossed over as the Lord your God did to the Red Sea, which he dried up before us until we had crossed over. That all the peoples of the earth may know that the hand of the Lord, that it is mighty, that you may fear the Lord your God forever. He says that this is important for them to remember. In verse one, he says in verse 22, specifically, he says that your children would know what happened here. He wanted this to be a perpetual reminder for them something incredible that had happened, that they would know the significance and the meaning of this event for generations to come. They could look back and know what God had done for them here. reflecting on the past would give them perspective, for their present and for their future. So let me share with you a couple of things from my past. This is one of my baseball jerseys from early on, and I confirmed that it no longer fits. So it's gonna have to stay in the box. But growing up sports were a big part of my life. I played a variety of things baseball, football, basketball, anything that that had a ball where you had to compete against someone else I was into it. And thinking about my days of sports helped me realize and remember this Important last lesson, and that is that being young is a gift. Being young is a gift. You know, as you get older, you don't always realize what you have in that moment. And I think that was true for me playing sports as a kid. Think about it, when you're younger, mom and dad pay the entry fee. They buy all of the equipment, they take you to all of your practices, they come to your games, and not just mom and dad. But when we would have a game brothers and sisters, and aunts and uncles and even grandparents would show up, it was like the World Series was going on. When you become an adult, you can still play sports. But if you join one of those city leagues, the only people that show up at the game are the referees. And they're just there because they're getting paid. When you are young, there is so much support that's around you. It's not just sports, there are other benefits you have your family, you have your health, your strength, you have what seems like endless amounts of energy. Young people are incredible at remembering things, they have great memories, they can learn very quickly, my kids know how to use certain things on my phone better than I do. And that's after just a few minutes of tinkering around. You also have tremendous amounts of free time. Let me tell you a little secret, when you start working, there is no summer break. Right? There's no winter holiday. And if you're fortunate you get a couple of weeks, but when you're young, there's this unbelievable amount of free time that you have. And that's a blessing, that's a that's a gift. There's also a whole list of things that you don't have to mess with things like failing health conditions, and paying your taxes and messing with bills, managing a career or taking care of a family worrying about your house, all the stressful things that adults have to mess with. You're free of those things. And then there's these opportunities that are around you to be around other young people, other friends, you get to go to camps, you get to go to special events where there's all these people, you can build relationships very quickly. When you're young, you start at your job, you can go days without seeing another person that's the same age because your responsibility is to is to your work. And so what I'm trying to say is that this time in your life is unique. It's special. It's a blessing from God. In Ecclesiastes chapter 11, in verse nine, he says Rejoice so young man in your youth and let your heart cheer you in the days of your youth, walk in the ways of your heart in the sight of your eyes. But know that for all these things, God will bring you into judgment. This is a unique time in your life. It's a time that should be enjoyed, but it's not absent of any type of responsibility or accountability. And so although there are a lot of blessings that come with being young things like trips, and adventure and things of that nature, whether we're young or old, we still give an account to God for the things that we do. The NLT translation says it this way, young people, it's wonderful to be young, enjoy every minute of it, do everything you want to do. Take it all in. But remember that you must give an account to God for everything that you do.

Conrad Harkrider  08:48
Whether we're young or old, we will ultimately give an account to God. Ecclesiastes, chapter 12. In verse one says, Remember also your Creator in the days of your youth before the evil days come and the years Draw near, of which you will say I have no pleasure in them. The writer says that the evil days are coming. The evil days, the difficult days are coming. And that is he's talking about the aging process. You think it's difficult or hard to get out of bed now. Just wait until you're 7080 years old and your body is riddled with arthritis. And so he says you are blessed now, in your youth. You're blessed with strength. What should you do with it? He says to remember your Creator, give some of that strength back to the Lord. Don't forget about God. Don't tell yourself that. I'm going to start serving God and start doing all of those things when I get a little older. That's the time for being more serious. No make a determination to serve God. Like Joseph did even when you're young. Remember Joseph didn't have everything perfect in it. Live, his life was an absence of any type of challenge or difficulty. He was mistreated by his family, he was sold into Egyptian bondage. He was Miss misrepresented while he was there and ended up in prison. But in all those things, despite everything that was going on around him, he never turned his back on God. He continued trusting in God, he continued, following his word, he kept doing the right thing, knowing that the Lord was going to be with him. In Proverbs chapter 20, in verse 29, it says, The glory of young men is their strength. Young people, you have a lot of strength, and energy, those are blessings from God, your ability to learn quickly, but I would ask you what, what are you doing with those things? How are you using those abilities? And those blessings? So maybe you have the ability to memorize anything? How much of that? Are you using? For the Lord? Are you memorizing his word? Because you memorize a scripture once every month? Or could you do one scripture every week? That's 52 in a year? Or what about your strength? You have all this energy and this enthusiasm. But is that just directed towards sports and video games and friends and social media? And things that are centered around ourselves? Or do we spend that time do we spend that energy trying to help others? When you're 17 years old, if you walk into a nursing home, that has a different effect, than somebody who is 57, who walks into the nursing home, just by being young, there is a blessing there, there's an encouragement that people receive, and you can use your situation, and your physician, to help encourage other people. Being young is a blessing, it's an opportunity to serve God. But remember, just as any older person will tell you, this is a gift that will not last forever. The time is short, and one day it will pass. When I was a senior in high school, one of the teachers at the school where I went in my English teacher, Miss Ross, she had us do this activity where we wrote down on a piece of paper, different thoughts or comments about every person in the class. So there was 2025, little pieces of paper that we filled out, and you could write a reflection or a funny story of something that you remember, or maybe some advice or just something that you appreciated about that person. And as I was going through the box, I found an envelope in the box with those 2025 different statements. And I was reading through them, and some of them were humorous. Some of them were flattering, nice things. But I wanted to share these two with you. These are what some of my classmates had to say to me and as a parting word. This one says, although we never really talked, I always appreciated how calm and courteous you were in class, good luck in the future. And then this one, I wish we'd spoken more. You're a great guy who's going somewhere.

Conrad Harkrider  13:47
I'm not sure where she thought I was going. I was going somewhere. But as I read those, there's kind of a theme there. I don't know if you picked up on it. But it really struck me. Their perception of me was a person who, for whatever reason, didn't talk to them. Didn't say anything to them. And the lesson from the box that I took from this is that everyone has influence. Everyone has influence whether for good or for bad. What is people's perception of you? What do people think about you? Do they think of you as being a person who is loud and funny? Are you the quiet, shy one? Are you serious? Or are you silly? How do people perceive you? What do they think about you? Reputation is not everything but people's perception of us still is important. And when I read these notes, I thought to myself, What did they think? What did these people think? Have me. Why was it that I didn't speak to these people? Was it something that was intentional? Or was it related to some type of immaturity? Was it pride? Was it arrogance. But I can tell you looking back on it, that's the last thing that they were going to say to me. I wish we had spoken more. I feel sorry about that. I wish that their perception of me was different. relationships matter. Words matter. How we treat people, those things matter. In John chapter 13, in verse 34, Jesus said, A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another, just as I have loved you. You also are to love one another. By this all people will know that you are my disciples if you have love for one another. What does Jesus say about people knowing that we are His disciples? Is it because we tell people that we read our Bibles? Is it because we say that we go to church on Sundays? No, he says, people are gonna know that you're my disciples, by the way that you treat them if you have love for others. loving others means that you treat people with kindness and courtesy. It means that you care about other people, you show interest in the lives of others, it means that you don't make fun of other people to their face or behind their back. It means that you're unselfish, it means that you would give up your place so that someone else could go first. It means that you think of others, instead of just yourself. In Philippians, chapter two and verse three, it says, Do nothing from rivalry or conceit, but in humility, count others more significant than yourselves. Taking an interest in the people around you. It's not just about what I'm trying to do, what I'm trying to accomplish who my friends are. But what about the say the other people who are the same age as me, they live in the same city, they go to the same school, what is happening in their life? I like this quote, it said, You will never look into the eyes of someone God does not love. Always be kind. Isn't it true that if we could see people as God sees them that that would give us a more compassionate, more loving, more considerate attitude towards them? You know, what hits you when you think about these things is that there are people that come into your life that are the only there for a short period of time. Maybe you only have one class with them for one semester, and then they move away, you're never around them again. So what are we doing? What are you doing with those opportunities? Are you making the most of the relationships that are that are around you? Do people look at us and think that is a person that is respectful? They care about others? They're focused on godly principles, they have strong high morals? Or would they look at us and just think that's just they're like anybody else? I can't tell the difference, or I wouldn't know the difference based upon how they treat me. Everyone has influence, no matter how old you are. Well, how about this one.

Conrad Harkrider  18:52
There's actually lots of these in the box. This was just one but this is one of my trophies. And growing up, I had a lot of these in my room. They used to display them on the shelf. I've seen some of your rooms been been at your houses and seeing your trophies, and sports and activities are important when you're growing up. They are a place where you can learn about principles life principles, working hard discipline, teamwork, success and failure. But it's not the sport itself that is most important. It's the things that you learn when you're playing that sport, or that activity or that extracurricular, whatever you're doing, that will hopefully help you in other areas of your life. You'll be able to use those same principles and apply them to other areas that are more important things like finding a job providing for a family, being committed to a spouse, helping being committed and working as a team in a, in a church in a body of Christians. Those are things that have much more significance than scoring points or being the best at a particular sport. But the lesson that I took thinking about this trophy is what's important to you now, will not always be that important. The things that are your highest priority right now, will not always be at the top of your list when I was younger, and we would have a game and we would lose, I would get upset, I was invested, I was wanting to win the game. And so I'd be frustrated, I'd be angry, there was times when I would even cry, the emotions are just so high. And on the flip side of that, when we would when you would be ecstatic, you would be so thrilled to accomplish a goal that trophy really signifies obtaining the goal that you have for yourself. And so what could be better than obtaining that goal reaching what you had set out for yourself? Could there be anything that was more fulfilling. But what I thought was most important to me, the things that I valued, the highest when I was younger, those things are now sitting in a box in the garage collecting dust. As we get older, our priorities change. What matters to us most. Is is different. And so the accomplishments in the awards that we may have worked so hard to obtain, now they lose, they lose their significance and their meaning. Something that we wanted, so badly now doesn't bring us any joy, or happiness. In Matthew chapter six and verse 19, he says, Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves do not break in and steal. For where your treasure is there your heart will be also Jesus says that if you put your heart into treasures here on Earth, you're bound to be disappointed. The Earth is a place where moth rust there's things destroy, thieves break in and still. But instead he says our hearts should be fixed. Verse 20, on treasures in heaven, on something that is eternal, it can't be tampered with or destroyed. It never loses its value or significance. In Jeremiah chapter nine, in verse 23, it says this says the Lord led not the wise man boast in his wisdom, whatnot, the mighty man boasts in his mind. Let not the rich man boast in his riches. Whatever it is that you think that you are good at, that you excel at. That's wonderful. Those are blessings and gifts that God has given to you. But it's not something to boast in. He says, Let him verse 24, let him who boasts boast in this that he understands and knows me that I am the Lord who practices steadfast love, justice and righteousness in the earth. For these things I delight declares the Lord. No matter how old we are, it's important to keep things in perspective to not allow our successes or our abilities or whatever it is that we excel in, to become our focus to get in the way of our relationship, and our connection to God.

Conrad Harkrider  23:54
And so it's a reminder for all of us to never sacrifice that relationship with God, or with anyone else, for that matter with parents or friends or family or people that are close to us. In pursuit of some achievement, or goal. Don't give up the things that are most important, trying to pursue the trophies of life. In Philippians, chapter three and verse eight, Paul said, I count everything is lost because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ Jesus, my Lord, for his sake, I have suffered the loss of all things and count them as rubbish, in order that I may gain Christ, the surpassing worth of knowing Jesus Christ, the great value that that relationship has and placing that at the forefront of the thing that we are pursuing the things that we're pursuing. Well In conclusion, these are some of the notes from the box. This is where things get really interesting because you can, you can learn a lot from a note that someone else wrote to you. These are from various friends, girls, people that gave me a note, this is Social Media 20 years ago. So if you're, if you don't know what that looks like, this is your Snapchat iMessage, you actually had to write it down on a piece of paper and hand it to someone who's a lot more work. But there's all kinds of stuff in these notes. News about what you're doing that weekend, and the what's happening in your classes and drama with friends. And then there's a lot of stuff about relationships, who's dating who. And it's kind of, it's kind of painful to read some of these things, to remember how we used to think and talk. And some of these things, I don't know if I'd want to give them for my kids to read, for them to see what we were talking about. And the point is that whatever was said and done in the past, there's nothing that we can do to go back and change it. And so that brings us to our last lesson tonight. And that is that you can't change the past. You can't change what's happened in the past. When you're young, your life is like this giant white canvas. It is Bear and open. And there's so many different directions that you can go. There's all different types of things that you can choose to do. The possibilities truly are endless. And as you live your life, you start to fill up that Canvas, you start to put things on it. But what you come to realize or what you come to understand is that you are working with permanent paint. There are no redos or do overs, whatever you put on the canvas, is there to stay. Now, I'm not saying that to make you feel guilty about something that has already occurred. I'm saying it because we need to think about the choices that we make the decisions that are in front of us. Sometimes they will have consequences that can last for the rest of our lives. If you do something that hurts another person, even if it's a very close relationship, a close friend, it's possible that that relationship could never be restored. It can never be brought back together. It can be severed forever. Sometimes our actions have lasting consequences. And we look back on the past and we see things that we did and maybe it causes us a feeling of remorse, we can't go back and change it. In Hebrews chapter 12 And verse 16, it says See to it, that no one is sexually immoral or unholy like Esau, who sold his birthright for a single meal. For you know that afterward when he desired to inherit the blessing. He was rejected for he found no chance to repent. Though he sought for it with tears. He saw wanting to go back and make things right, he sought for it with tears, you know what we call that?

Conrad Harkrider  28:58
We call that regret.

Conrad Harkrider  29:05
If we were to go around the room tonight and ask every person here what's one thing that you regret doing when you were younger? I can guarantee you that we would all be able to come up with something because we're not perfect people. All of us make mistakes. But one of the goals of living through the challenging years of when you're a teenager middle school, in high school, and even into college is to come out of that time of life with as few regrets as possible. And so you don't have to break your leg. Jumping off the fence. You can listen to someone who says that's not a good idea. You don't have to experience everything. Just to come To know that I shouldn't get into that I shouldn't participate in that. You can listen to the wisdom and guidance and counsel of others. In Proverbs chapter five and verse seven, it says, And now sons Listen to me, and do not depart from the words of my mouth. Keep your way far from her, and do not go near the door of her house. What does the Father tell his son about avoiding adultery? He says, don't even go near, stay far away from her house.

Conrad Harkrider  30:47
Do you want to know the best way to get rid of an addiction to pornography? It's to never start watching pornography. Do you want to know the best way to not get dragged down by drugs and alcohol. It's to never start doing drugs and alcohol. It is so painful to watch people go into their 30s and 40s. And beyond struggling with things that they picked up when they were younger. Something that they decided to try just to see what it was like. And then they realized what was happening and they tried to turn back. But they were trapped. They were stuck.

Conrad Harkrider  31:45
They couldn't get away from it. And so what I want to tell you tonight is that you can't change the past. You can't unsee that movie, you can't unlearn the song. There were things that songs that I can still tell you every word, every chorus, every line, because I listened to it so many times when I was younger, and I can't get those things out of my mind. And so the caution is to be careful. God does offer forgiveness. But that doesn't mean that we don't still have to deal with the scars and the effects of our choices and our sin. And so be careful. Listen to your parents. Listen to people who are older than you. People are trying to help you avoid some of the same pitfalls that they went down that they found themselves in. Put your faith in God. And remember that no matter what happens or where you find yourself, the Lord will never leave you or forsake you. We're going to close tonight with an invitation song. If you haven't submitted your life to Jesus Christ, by obeying Him, being baptized and confessing Him as Lord and Savior. We want to encourage you to make that step tonight or if there's something else that we can do to pray for you or help you in your walk with Christ. Please come down to the front as we stand in seeing
