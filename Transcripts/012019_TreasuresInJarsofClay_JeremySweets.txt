Good morning. Certainly good to see everybody is always a good day when we can gather together and worship our God.

Jeremy Sweets  00:15
Get my mic situated. I mentioned often that our goal here at Broadmoor is to give God glory and honor and praise and all that we do. And I appreciate Evans comment that ultimately, that's where all of human history is headed, giving God glory and praise, and we will ultimately do that one day.

Jeremy Sweets  00:45
My first job out of college was with the state. And it was with a group called the Commission on children and youth, the Commission on children and youth. And what that agency did was look at the foster care system throughout the state, and in a sense, serve as an oversight or, or audits upon those that went into the foster care system. And so one of the things they did is they had these different regions throughout the state. And they would go and examine different cases or things that stood out, provide statistics on the types of children that were there, and the things that were face. And so most of the people that work, there were social workers. And they were examining those that were social workers, and social workers, like any other profession has good apples and bad apples. One of the things I noticed about those that were good is that they found they found value in what they were doing, because of the importance of the jaw. If they were there to check off a list or to get a paycheck, or to receive a lot of things, those things were pretty well absent. And those were the bad apples, those that didn't do such a good job, those that had forgotten why they were there, the care that they were to provide for children, particularly children in need, those that were outstanding at their job. Did it despite the many challenges that they face, like the low pay the thankless job, the tremendous workload that they had, and so they remembered why they were there, and what they were doing. And they were doing a very important job, because, again, the welfare of children was at stake. When I look at Paul, I'm amazed at his attitude. I think he had a similar attitude. He was there for the salvation of others, even greater job as he was looking to the souls of other people. But in many ways, it was a thankless job. We know that Christianity has spread to a great deal today. There are many churches throughout the land. There are many Christians that we see. But this was not the state of affairs in the first century. Paul had to face a great deal of opposition. He suffered, because of the message that he taught. He was persecuted. He was not given things. It was not a job that paid tremendously well. He was supported and able to live. But he was able to keep her perspective on what he was doing because he remembered why he was doing it. The job that he was doing it, it was not because of the perks, so to speak, of the job, but he found value in the very job itself. In Second Corinthians Chapter Four passage that we read for our Bible reading. We see in verse seven, he says, but we have this treasure, in jars of clay, to show that the surpassing power belongs to God and not to us. treasure in jars of clay, I love that imagery. And I see in Paul one that was able to keep the right perspective because he remembered who he was. He remembered what he was doing and why he was doing it. And he remembered the great God that he served. And he did that in his mission in preaching the gospel. And I would say and suggest that we have a similar we need to have a similar mindset as Christians. We might not all be preachers like Paul are traveling around as he did are facing the exact same situation. But as Christians, if we're doing it so called for the perks. So others might think well of us or so that we can receive Pat's on the back or any number of reasons. We're not going to be very good Christians. But if we remember what we're doing and why we're doing it and the great importance of that, then we'll be able to like Paul and your sufferings or do this despite whether it's a A thankful or a thankless job, we'll be able to do it despite all of those things. treasure in jars of clay, I'd like to talk for that about that for just a few moments this morning. treasures in jars of clay. This word first of all means earthen vessels. In fact, you may have a translation that says earthen vessels I believe the King James New King James New American Standard, and several versions use that exact language. Paul, when he talks about these jars of clay was talking about a very fragile, inferior common

Jeremy Sweets  05:45
piece of pottery was found in every household, throughout the Greek and Roman world. And I know that because I was there for most every household, I would guess, had these jars and plate they were very common. They were everywhere. And they were not fine china, but rather they were they were fragile. They were prone to breaks and cracks. They could be easily dented or broken. They were inferior like said there were bronze vessels or the equivalent of fine china the day that were special that were cared for. But that was not these common everyday vessels, these earthen vessels, they were also expendable. They were cheap, and common. And if it broke, it was merely discarded. People didn't save up all their broken jars of clay or earthen vessels, this pottery, but it was simply discarded. In fact, you may see when archeological digs are dug, this is one of the main things that are found pottery. And today they may preserve some of these things, but you can see the cracks and the the way that the pottery can deteriorate. You can see how fragile these things are. And so it is it is this word this this vessel, this picture that Paul chose to describe himself, all was not full of himself, saying, Look how great I am. He recognized that he was an earthen vessel. He was a vessel. Sometimes we might think about a channel. He was one that was doing a work fulfilling a function. And there was nothing particularly special or important about him. Paul did not step aside and say I have this great training therefore I am so great in my job. No, in fact, he says no, I'm willing to give up all of that. And I recognize that I am a fragile, broken, cheap, common clay pot. I find it interesting that this word earthen vessels reminds me of what we are as humans, and that is that we are dust. We are dust. In Genesis chapter two and verse seven, it says Then the Lord God formed the man of the dust of the ground. We are when we break it down. We have lots of organs we function away God has made us in an amazing way but the value of our bodies is not in its material components. Because we are dust in Genesis three verse 19, when when God was punishing or announcing the curses upon the first couple and the serpent, he says by the sweat of your face speaking to the man you shall eat bread, till you return to the ground. For out of it you were taken for your dust and to dust you shall return not only are we dust in our makeup, but that's exactly what we will return to we have no lasting value in our earthly body. Our bodies will decay and since they will disappear, our earthly bodies will not be here. And we may find bones and things like that and bones can be preserved and the right kind of climate but bones also decay and the right conditions bones can decay and from what I understand and even as little as a decade if it's in a moist or some other kind of conditions conducive to that our bodies are dust. We are literally aren't we earthen vessels. We are dust where the ground. We come from the ground. And so there is nothing A special in the makeup of our bodies and Paul recognize this. We are not to look down upon ourselves but we're cheap, common, earthen vessels were dirt. Now the way to say that is not to become people that are full of despair. In fact, I think you see, and Paul the exact opposite, but also not the not people that are full of themselves. Now people that are arrogant, you've heard the description of those that a man that thinks he's He's God's gift to women, or he's so important,

Jeremy Sweets  10:38
any woman would be lucky to have him. Sometimes we take that mindset really with life in general, we are God's gift to the world. We are so great, we are so special. And Paul says, No, there is a treasure but we are not it. We are not the gift. We are earthen vessels, I find that to be a particularly helpful concept. And I appreciate that, Paul, recognize this. We are Earth investments. Elsewhere in Scripture, we see that our existence our life is compared to a vapor, or a mist. It's compared to a breath and Psalm 144 chateau in Psalm 102. In Second Samuel 14, it says that it is like spilled water on the ground that soon disappears. And First Peter refers to our life as withering grass, or a flate. Fading flower. Our life is temporary. Our life is fleeting. Our bodies are flesh, blood, joints, and bones, but they will all decay and decompose. If you've ever seen a collection, maybe from an archeological dig, they often kind of a trash heap, you'll see this big collection of these clay pots, and they're broken. They're shattered in many kinds, they are decaying, they're going back to dust, isn't that really a description of who we are. That's what we are. We are dust. Now, many people without a vision of God and understanding of God will stop there and end in despair. There's no point to life, we're just a bunch of random component parts, we are all decay, there is nothing in this life and that you have to ignore that in order to live your life you find whatever joy you can. But it's a pretty dark view of life. There's no points. And there are many that have made that statement. Many smart people with PhDs, after they've examined things, if they remove God from the equation, they may have studied many great things. But they'll conclude in many cases that there is no point to life. Or if there is a point it's only to help one another or define joy or something along those lines. But ultimately, there is no grand scheme of life. And you can see very quickly how if you have that view, it will lead to despair. So is that what happens with Paul all says we're earthen vessels. Is Paul in despair. Is he going to be depressed? Because that is his condition? Well, I

Jeremy Sweets  13:43
don't believe so. In fact, he talks about what we have, and a great value of what we have. And he says what we have is a treasure. What we have is a treasure. We are containers are vessels for a treasure. A treasure is something that is stored up a treasure is something that is valuable. A treasure is something that is cared for that many people want. A treasure is something that people spend their entire lives seeking after. And you'll notice right away the great contrast. When we had treasures today, we put those in a safety deposit box or a protective case or we store those up. We may display those to others. We may guard those and want to pass them on to our children. But Paul says here that the container is an earthen vessel. And that shows us even more that the value is not in the container. The value there is in the treasure and the treasure. Now in First Corinthians second Corinthians chapter four, all says now we have this treasure, he doesn't exactly identify the treasure. But you'll find in the first several chapters of Second Corinthians Paul is making, in essence, a defense of his ministry. He's making a defense of his apostleship, that he is not seeking to speak the gospel, to tell them the truth of the Corinthians in order to gain anything. He's not doing this out of a state of arrogance, but rather he is seeking simply to serve God. And so he talks about his ministry. And you might even broaden that to think about the treasure as the gospel, the word of God what he was ministering with the tool of his trade. Also, as elsewhere in Second Timothy chapter one and verse 12, he talks about his confidence and being able to guard until that day what has been entrusted to me in there, I believe he's talking about the gospel is entrusted. We spent a year talking about being a faithful steward. And Paul was a faithful steward, entrusted with the gospel and earthen vessel, but with a great and grand treasure, a great and grand treasure, the value, and we see he makes this follow up statement immediately, the value is not in us. But the value is found in God. But we have this treasure in jars of clay to show that the surpassing power, there's not even, it's really not even a fair comparison. It's not something you say, well, the treasure is a little bit more now it's vastly superior. It really doesn't even belong in the same page. In a comparison, a clay pot and everyday clay pot, something that's discarded, put away, cheap, broken, compared to the treasure, all says, what we have is this treasure, we have the treasure. And I think this goes a long way and in building for Paul, a purpose in life, all does not despair. Because although he is an earthen vessel, he is an earthen vessel created by God, and to be used by God, he has a function or a purpose in our work. Although sometimes we don't want to work we enjoy time off. But our work is of great value and importance. It gives us purpose in many ways. And we can do that even in a secular so to speak, job or something like that. But ultimately, as Christians, we all have a work, don't we, we all have a work. And that gives us purpose. And we can find our value in that we do not need to despair. Because there are important things to do to occupy ourselves in there is work to do. We are Jars of Clay, but what we have is a treasure. What we have is a treasure. So how should we behave? You know, it's interesting that Paul was able to combine this purpose. And on both sides of that we find that he has humility and confidence. And that's a hard balance to have, isn't it? I think Paul shows us how we can have both humility and confidence. Some people would say those are competing

Jeremy Sweets  18:32
virtues, you can't lower yourself and have confidence. You can't lower yourself and think great of this. But I think Paul strikes that balance. And I think he shows us how we can strike that balance. First of all, humility. Well, Paul says he's an earthen vessel. Paul purposely chose this picture for himself. Is that how we think about ourselves? Do we lower ourselves, we say there's nothing special about me. But there is something special about the one we serve. We need to be those that humble ourselves. In Philippians chapter two it says Have this mind among yourselves which is yours in Christ Jesus, who humbled himself. It came to the earth and became a man lived as a man and died a horrible death, all humbled himself, but within this humility as he looked at himself and saw a person of humble means one who had sinned before God and was not worthy. You would use that language of the great grace that God had given to him. Paul lived his life with great purpose. In fact, it's because of the fact that he was unworthy that I think that that push this agenda purpose even further. He was one that says in Romans 11, verse 13. was an apostle to the Gentiles, he was called to preach and proclaim the gospel. So that he would say in Romans chapter one, verses 14 and 15, I am under obligation, both to the Greeks and to the barbarians both to the lies into the foolish. So I am eager to preach the gospel to you also who were in Rome. If all he felt was obligation, I'm not sure that he would be as great evangelist as he was, felt this duty. Sometimes we view jobs as drudgery, or something to check off, I simply want to get through with this, you might think about that social worker at the beginning, those that have forgotten what they're doing, and why they're doing it. It simply wants to get to the end of the day, or get through as many cases as they came because the workload is too great. They did not make the best social workers. And so Paul here says, I find it a duty but he goes on to say, but I'm eager to preach the gospel. I see the value in this and it's not easy, it's difficult, but I see the great value. As Christians, we have a similar purpose, do we not a purpose to serve God and give God glory and all things in First Peter chapter two and verse 11. It says, Beloved, I urge you as sojourners and exiles to abstain from the passions of the flesh, which wage war against your soul. Keep your conduct among the Gentiles honorable, so that when they speak against you as evildoers, they may see your good deeds and glorify God on the day of visitation. Those that hurl insults at us, as they fling things at US charges at us, these are charges that will not stick. We are to be people that are honorable, pure, godly, in our conduct, our greatest, our greatest check, our greatest responsibility. Our greatest judge, maybe that's the right word, is not the world. Our greatest critic is not the world. But it is the word of God and God Himself. And so we bear our own selves against that standard, less concerned with what the world thinks about us as we are pursuing righteousness and more concerned with what God thinks about us. We have a purpose, and because of that, we can live with confidence. And Paul found the right balance because he did not find confidence in himself. But he found confidence in his purpose, and the one he served. And I think that's why he was able to strike this balance. He didn't think that he was so great, but that he served one that was so great. And so he could have confidence in his God and First Corinthians one and verse 31, let the one who boasts both in the Lord.

Jeremy Sweets  23:18
We can be humble in ourselves and say we serve a great God. We can have all in what he has done, Praise His name, boldly, go before others, and talk about our great God, I'm nothing but God is everything. I'm an earthen vessel, a clay pots. That doesn't mean I'm useless. I have no purpose. No, I serve a great and awesome God. And when we have that view of God and confidence in God, and I believe we can also have confidence in our mission, our our job, our function, our life as far as what we are to do. We can have confidence in what we are doing. Paul said in Romans chapter one and verse 16, I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power of God. Salvation to everyone who believes to the Jew first and also to the Greek. God is powerful and his word, the Gospel is powerful. We can be confident in that. We can be confident without being arrogant. Because it depends on where we place our confidence. Our confidence is in God and in the power of His Word. We don't have to shrink away. We don't have to be a shame. If we were put on the stand, maybe we would do those things. But we realize the gospel is the true power of God. It is the god Last fall, that is his power to say, and so we can have confidence, confidence. As I read through Second Corinthians, I was impressed with how Paul brought these themes, this idea of humility, purpose, simplicity of life, having a life that is transparent to others of godliness, and confidence how he tied these things together over and over and over again. We're not going to study the whole book of Second Corinthians, obviously in this lesson, but let me read a few passages where he combines these things. I think it's wonderful to see his attitude there and his his mission, his purpose, in Second Corinthians one and verse 12. He says, For our boast is this, the testimony of our conscience, that we behaved in the world with simplicity and godly sincerity, not by earthly wisdom, but by the grace of God and supremely so towards you. Our boast is not in our greatness, but in our simplicity, our sincerity, our earnest desire to serve God. We're not boasting about great accomplishments, Paul says, but in the simple service of God, usually that was looked down upon all says, We can boast and fulfilling our purpose. In Second Corinthians two and verse 14. Notice the way he describes what he is doing. And I'm reminded again, he saw the value in what he was doing. Second Corinthians two and verse 14. But thanks be to God who in Christ always leads us in a triumphal procession. And through us spreads the fragrance of the knowledge of him everywhere, For we are the aroma of Christ to God, among those who are being saved, and among those who are perishing. Notice he goes later in the verse 17. He says, For we are not like so many peddlers of God's word, but as men of sincerity as commissioned by God in the sight of God, we speak Christ. Notice because he had confidence in the gospel. He says here that we don't have to be peddlers. It's not some trick. The Greatness is not in the presentation, so to speak, the greatness is not in trying to pull one over. It's not that Paul is a great salesman. And he can convince anybody sell ice to an Eskimo, so to speak, something that's not needed. No, that's not Paul. He doesn't have to pedal the Word of God. He's not doing this, because it's useless. He's not doing this because he can gain something from it.

Jeremy Sweets  27:55
As you continue on in chapter three and verse four, notice what he says, Second Corinthians three and verse four, such as the confidence that we have through Christ toward God. Not that we are sufficient in ourselves to claim anything is coming from us. But our sufficiency is from God, who has made us sufficient to me ministers have a new covenant, not of the letter, but of the Spirit for the letter kills, but the Spirit gives ly notice verse for the confidence that we have, through Christ toward God, it's not us, but our sufficiency comes from Him. In chapter three, verse 12, since we have such a hope, we are very bold. We are very bold. Paul and his ministry could say we are bold, can we say that as Christians? We are very bold in verse 18, of chapter three, and we all with unveiled face beholding the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from one degree of glory to another. This comes from the Lord who is the spear, we see that Paul was one that found great confidence in God great value in what he was doing. And second Corinthians chapter four and verse one, as we begin with what was the scripture reading this morning, and verse one and two, therefore, having this ministry by the mercy of God, we do not lose heart. But we have renounced disgraceful, underhanded ways we refuse to practice cunning or to tamper with God's word, but by the Open statement of the truth, we would commend ourselves to everyone's conscience in the sight of God. When Paul recognized who he was, who he was serving, and what he was doing that affected how he approached his ministry that Oh, no need to change the gospel so that others accepted it. He saw no need to make it more flattering or To alter it so that more people would accept it. That was never his intention. And it shouldn't be ours is confidence was in the Gospel. And so he sought the space to speak it plainly. And simply, I've heard the statement and I believe this in many ways, my job as a preacher is to get out of the way and let the message shine forth. I want God's word to be spoken. I know Mike wants that. I know Conrad wants that. I believe this congregation wants that it is God's word. And that is our focus. That is our focus. We don't want to be center of attention. God's word is what is center of attention. And so we don't have to change alter becoming pull one over on people. We don't have to attract people with something else and pull a bait and switch. No, we simply speak the word of God plainly, and simply. That's what Paul did. And verse five of chapter four, he says, For what we proclaim is not ourselves but Jesus Christ as Lord with ourselves as Your servants for Jesus sake. reminded of Matthew five verse 16, let your light shine in such a way that that people may see your good works and glorify your Father in heaven. We're not attracting for ourselves glory and praise, but we're deflecting, reflecting and deflecting, we are trying to point people to go and we are vessels in that we are not the treasurer. Our goal should not be to get the Pat's on the back, to receive the many things to have people think well of us to people praise us. That is not our goal as Christians, but rather, to praise God to praise God. Paul had confidence and that's why he could say in Second Corinthians four in verse eight, we are afflicted in every way but not crushed, perplexed, but not driven to despair, persecuted, but not forsaken struck down but not destroyed. Paul did not despair, because he was an earthen vessel.

Jeremy Sweets  32:21
He says, No, it's difficult, there is suffering to face and Paul mentions that several times in his letter, but I'm not crushed. There is discouragement, but not Ultimate Despair. There is persecution, but we will not forsake God and we are not forsaken. We are struck but not destroyed. As he goes through this letter, and we can continue on particularly through the first seven chapters of Second Corinthians we see this purpose, combining humility, and confidence. And I really appreciate that message. I need to hear that message. I see him Paul a life that was driven to serve God. Well, as we continue in second Corinthians chapter four, notice what he says in verses 10 through 12. Paul talks about what he bears, and I think a similar point could be made about Christians. He says, always carrying in the body, the death of Jesus so that the life of Jesus may also be manifested in our bodies, for we who live are always being given over to death for Jesus sake, so that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our mortal flesh. So death is at work in us but life in you notice what Paul said he carried with him, or he carried in his body, he carried in this earthen vessel. In many ways, he reflected our great Savior, it became an earthen vessel for us, and Paul says, I carry in my body, the death of Jesus, he did this, as we mentioned in his suffering, and his suffering. In Philippians, chapter three, in verse seven and eight, he talks about the fact that he gave up all things he counted them as rubbish in order to serve Christ. And he mentions and to share in verses 10 and 11, and to share in His suffering. Paul saw suffering as a necessary component of being a follower of Jesus, of bearing in his body, the suffering and the death of Jesus Christ. He also I believe, talked about carrying the, in his body the death of Jesus as a self denial. Galatians chapter two and verse 20, says, I have been crucified with Christ and it is no longer I who live but Christ who lives in me, but Christ who lives in me, it's not me. Oh, I am not the one directing the show, calling the shots seeking what makes me happy. I am not living in that sense, but it is Christ who lives in me. Paul carried the death of Jesus with him in his suffering, and his self denial. And he did that so that he could carry the life of Jesus as well. What a beautiful picture that we could be earthen vessels for the very life and death of Jesus. We are to carry in our bodies are manifest in our bodies display in our bodies, also the life of Jesus. I want to notice in First Peter chapter two verses 21 through 24. I think this passage shows us in many ways, how we manifest the life of Jesus in our bodies, First Peter to 21 through 24. I believe that Jesus appeared to highlight some of the elements that that showed who he was, he lived a godly life. He was dependent upon God. He was focused on other people. And First Peter to in verse 21. There it says, For this, you have been called because Christ also suffered for you, leaving you an example so that you might follow in his steps. He committed no sin. neither was deceit found in his mouth. When he was reviled, He did not revile and return when he suffered, he did not threaten but continued and trusting himself. To him who judges justly. He himself bore our sins and his body on the truth that we might die to sin and with and righteousness by his wounds you have been healed. For you were straying like sheep, but have now returned to the Shepherd and overseer of your soul. It's not just that he did what was right. But he did what was right in the face of great opposition. When many people will retaliate, when many people will feel justified in returning evil, because they did it first. Jesus didn't do that.

Jeremy Sweets  37:17
He was godly in the face of persecution in the face of suffering in the face of difficulties, and so must we be. And he did that by entrusting Himself to His great father. And so must we do interesting our lives ourselves to our great God. And because of that he was focused on others giving his life so that others might die to sin and live to righteousness. Jesus gave himself so that we might do that. So let us fulfill that mission, first of all, but then also extend ourselves to other people. Yes, we bear the life and death of Jesus Christ. This year, we're talking about being raised with Christ. And all of those things are encompassed in that picture. Those that are raised with Christ put to death, the old man, they carry, we carry in our bodies, the death of our Lord, but we're raised to walk in newness of life, and we carry in our bodies, or we seek to display or manifest the very life of Christ, and godliness and dependence upon God and in focusing on others. It's a great theme. It's something we need to think continually about. And this passage, I think, points us to that facts. We are earthen vessels, Jars of Clay, clay pots, but we have a great treasure. And we can take confidence in that in serving God. What about you? Are you serving God as you should? Are you here this morning and you're not a Christian, you have an opportunity to obey the gospel message, believing that Jesus is the Christ, repenting of your sins, confessing that Jesus is the Christ and being baptized in the water for the forgiveness of your sins. That's a starting place. Because you commit your entire life. That's when you begin to walk each and every day in his service. Maybe you're here this morning, and you are a Christian, and you're not living as you should. I think we all need to be reminded of this picture of Paul, I think it would do us all good to think about that. But maybe you're continuing in sin in such a way that you are jeopardizing your soul or you're straying from the Lord, do not delay and making that right this very hour this very moment. If you're not living as you should make your life right. There's any subject to the invitation. Please come as we stand and sing at this time.
