Do you have your Bibles that want to be turning to Romans chapter seven?

Conrad Harkrider  00:23
When I was a little boy, one year for my birthday, I received a coin, a half dollar coin, it's got a picture of President Kennedy on one side and then an eagle on another. And there's nothing really that significant, it's worth 50 cents half $1. But they're not as common as most coins, you don't typically get them back when you're at the grocery store, whatever. And so to me, it was significant, it was special. And I carried that thing everywhere. It was in my pocket when I would go to church and to school and to the grocery store. And whenever I was out, or at home, I had, my 50 cent piece is what I called it in my pocket. There was one afternoon that my dad went to get some gas. And he took me and my brothers with him. And after filling up, he went in to the convenience store to pay for for the gas. And while I was in there, I saw some of those giant sweethearts. They come for in a pack. And my eyes got real big. And so I went and asked my dad, I said, Can we get some of those? And he looked at me and he said, Well, how are you going to pay for it? And that really was the problem because I didn't have any money with me. Except for my 50 cent coin. So I went up to the attendant and I asked her, I said, Well, how much for the sweethearts? And wouldn't you know they were 50 cents. I put my coin on the counter, I took my candy. And I went back and got in the car. It must have been like, I don't know, five minutes. I was too sweet tarts into the pack when it hit me what had just happened. And I burst into tears. And I started crying and I'm begging my Dad, can we go back to the store? Can we try to get it back? And you probably know his answer. He's like, it's it's gone. Now you made your decision. And that may seem like a very childish illustration. But we do that all the time, don't we? Where we give up something that is valuable to us. And we find ourselves doing something that we would have never intended to do. We do the very thing that that we hate that we despise. How does that happen? This morning, I want to talk to you briefly about the nature of sin. And kind of focusing on the aspect of sin that Paul describes in Romans chapter seven and verse 15. When he talks about doing the thing that we hate doing that thing that is abhorrent to us. Read with me in Romans chapter seven, beginning in verse 14. It says, For we know that the law is spiritual, but I am carnal sold under sin. For what am I for what I am doing, I do not understand for what I will to do that I do not practice. But what I hate that I do. Paul speaks about the nature of sin. And he describes the struggle that is going on inside of us. There's this contrast between our flesh, and then those things and then the Spirit. And he says in verse 15, I don't really understand my actions. He's not saying that he's unaware of what he's doing. He's not saying that he's in some type of semi conscious states and he doesn't know what's happening. But instead, it doesn't make sense to him. That is why am I doing this? Have you ever felt that way? You look back on something that you did in your life and you you think to yourself, was that me? Was I really the one that was there that was partaking in that or going forward with that? What was I thinking we can't really even believe that that was us. We end up doing the thing that we hate.

There are different kinds of sins that are discussed in the scriptures. Sometimes we sin because we are ignorant. And an example of this is the apostle Paul. Before he came to Christ, he made it his goal, his mission to persecute Christians. He was ignorant, he was unaware he was misinformed, and it was causing him to do terrible things. And that's sometimes is the case with us, we are ignorant. Sometimes we sin because of indifference. James chapter two talks about If a brother or sister is in need of food, or clothing, and we see them, and it makes no difference to us, it doesn't affect us, we don't really care. It doesn't cause us to move or to take action. Then James says, not only is that sin, but that our faith is dead. It's a sin of indifference. But then there's also this idea of the sin a sin of indulgence. And maybe that's what we're focusing on here. Something that we know to be wrong, but yet, we indulge in it anyways, because of our our desires. Look at verse 19, Romans 719, he says, For the good that I will to do, I do not do but the evil I will not to do that. I practice. It here is good that I want to do, it's what I'm desiring to do, and here's evil that I want to stay away from, and yet, I completely reverse it, I find myself doing the evil instead of the good. So I want to explore that for just a few moments. How does that happen? Why does that happen? And then, more importantly, how can we overcome that? Or at least how can we better fight against those tendencies and those desires? Well, let's go back to the very beginning. Turn with me, in Genesis to Genesis chapter two. Genesis chapter two. Just as God has created the world, he's made man he's put him into the Garden of Eden given him this place where he can live. And look what he says in Genesis chapter two, beginning in verse 15. It says, Then the Lord God took the man and put him in the garden of Eden to attend it and keep it. And the LORD God commanded the man saying, Of every tree of the garden, you may freely eat, but of the notch, but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, you shall not eat, for in the day that you eat of it, you shall surely die. First of all, notice when we think about the nature of sin, and this desire to do the things that we despise, realize that we have free will. God created us with free will. Here we see God puts Adam and Eve in this beautiful garden. It's got lush trees, there is food and fruit that they're able to eat. The animals are there. They have a perfect relationship with God. They have safety and protection. But then God gives them this commandment, this directive, he says, that there is a tree in the middle of the garden, the tree of knowledge, of good and evil, and that tree is off limits. It's not to be touched. Now, if you think about why did God put that tree in the garden? Why didn't God just put it on the other side of the world where they would never go? Or why not put a flaming sword around the tree to guard it so that there was no way that they could have access to it instead, he puts it right in the middle of the garden in plain sight with full access. And I believe what we see here is the the gift or the blessing of freewill, we have the ability to choose.

Conrad Harkrider  09:48
If the command had not been given, then there would be no choice there would be no decision that they would have to make you think about how animals are different animals act up based upon instinct, they smell something, they see something, they hear a noise and they react. And you see this with people who tried to keep exotic animals as pets, they may have that from the time that it's very small, and they raise it, they've been around it for years and years. And then there comes a time when they are with the animal. And all of a sudden, there's an incident, there's some type of attack, because there's only so much training that you can do. You can't take the wild, out of the animal. But we are different humans are different. God created us in His image. And we have the capacity to determine our path. And our direction, we have the ability to choose whether we are going to do what he's said, or if we are going to follow a different direction or path. And in this case, Eve is is tempted and listens to the whispers and the lies of the devil. But we are we have been given free will we have a choice. We'll look at chapter three, and verse one that the text we looked at, during the Lord's Supper, it says, The serpent was more cunning than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made. He said to the woman has got indeed said you shall not eat of every tree of the garden. And the woman said to the serpent, We may eat the fruit of the trees of the garden, But the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God has said, you shall not eat it, nor shall you touch it, lest you die. Then the serpent said to the woman, You shall not surely die for God knows that in the day you eat it, your eyes will be open, and you will be like God knowing good and evil. So when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, that it was pleasant to the eyes that the tree was desirable to make one wise. She took its fruit and ate it. She also gave to her husband with her, and he ate. Here, we find this exchange between Eve and the serpent and the serpent. He basically says, I know what God has told you. But let me tell you the rest of the story, let me give you a better deal. If you eat this fruit. Here are all of the great things that are going to happen in verse four, you will not die. Verse five, your eyes will be opened and you will be like God. And he presents a totally different picture of what's going to happen to Eve if she takes this fruit. And what we see playing out here we think about the nature of sin is that we have these cravings, we have these desires, these appetites, Eve is drawn away by a desire for more. It wasn't that she was lacking fruit in the garden. But yet, she wants the fruit from this tree. She has a relationship with God, she has a connection, there's no shame, no fear, no guilt, but she wants more than that. She wants to be wise she wants to be equal with God. And we see the same thing in our lives, even after we make the determination that something is wrong, that it's off limits, that doesn't just necessarily take all of the desire away. It doesn't magically remove the appeal of that sin. James chapter one and verse 14, says that we are tempted and lured and enticed by our desires, we desire things that are pleasurable, that are satisfying. Look at the way that verse six describes the fruit from the tree here. It says so when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, that it was pleasant to the eyes, it was desirable to make one wise, it was a delight to her eyes. Can you imagine if, instead of a tree with fruit, God said, you shall surely not eat from the pile of rocks, of knowledge of good and evil, or you shall not touch the cactus of knowledge of good and evil. Now I'm sure at some point in the history of man, someone would have walked over and swallowed one of the rocks just to see what would happen. But the point is, the devil doesn't use things that are unappealing.

Conrad Harkrider  14:49
He takes things that he knows will be of value or benefit or desire to us. And that's what he puts In our path, and we have these cravings. Also, consider that we are easily persuaded. This is her Creator that has given her this instruction. Now not some unknown source, some distant being or authority, but this is the one that fashioned and made her and how much connection and interaction that she had had with God, but she understood and knew where he stood on this what they were supposed to do. And yet in a conversation with the serpent, it appears to be a first time attempt by the devil. She goes in, he presents this before her, and she is easily easily convinced or persuaded to give in. And what we see with the nature of sin is that no matter how adamant, we may be that we are not going to do something, oftentimes, we are very quick, to change our minds to go in the opposite direction. Look in Exodus chapter 19. And another example of this, Exodus 19, as the children of Israel have come out of Egypt, and now they are camped at Mount Sinai, and God is delivering the law to them, he's about to make this covenant with them. Exodus chapter 19, and verse four. He says, You have seen what I did to the Egyptians, how I bore you on eagles wings, and brought you to myself. Now therefore, if you will, indeed obey my voice, and keep my covenant, then you shall be a special treasure to me, above all people, for all the earth is mine. And you shall be to Me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation. These are the words which you shall speak to the children of Israel. So Moses came and called for the elders of the people and laid before them all these words which the Lord commanded him. Then all the people answered together and said, all that the Lord has spoken, we will do. So Moses brought back the words of the people, to the Lord. God says, I've taken you out of Egypt, I born you on the eagle's wings, I provided for you. And now I'm about to deliver you into this land, I'm going to make a covenant with you, you're going to be my special treasure and the people say, Yes, that's what we want. We agree, Lord, we are going to hold up this covenant and obey your commands. Turn to chapter 32. As Moses goes up to the mountain to receive the commands from the Lord, chapter 32. And verse one. It says, Now, when the people saw that Moses delayed and coming down from the mountain, the people gathered together, gathered together to Aaron and said to him, Come, make us Gods that shall go before us. For as for this Moses, the man who brought us out of the land of Egypt, we do not know what has become of him. And Aaron said to them, break off the golden earrings, which are in the ears of your wives, your sons and your daughters and bring them to me. So all the people broke off the golden earrings, which were in their ears and brought them to Aaron, and they, and he received the gold from their hand, and he fashioned it with an engraving tool and made a molded calf. Then they said, This is your God, oh, Israel, that brought you out of the land of Egypt. Wow. Moses has been gone, not even two months, he goes up on the mountain for 40 days, and that people start to get discouraged. And they say, We don't know what's happened to him. We need another God. We need something that's right in front of us that we can see with our eyes. And so they decide to take action. They ask Aaron, to make them this God. And ironically, they take the gold the earrings that the Lord had allowed them to plunder from the Egyptians and this blessing that God had given them now they're using it to create an idol. Six weeks earlier, not even six weeks earlier, they were saying we want to be a covenant. We want to be your people forever.

Conrad Harkrider  19:50
And now they are bowing down to a statue of a cow. How does that happen? We are a people who are easily persuaded. And it's important to acknowledge or at least to realize, because when dealing with sin is not something where it's just a light switch that we can flip off and say that's I'm done with it now. There are temptations and struggles and issues that that we that we deal with. That sometimes will be a battle that we face for years and years. And it often comes back to the fact that at any moment we could change good or bad. So let's think about breaking out of some of these tendencies. Notice, in Proverbs 26, and verse 11, Proverbs 26 And verse 11. It says, like a dog that returns to his vomit is a fool who repeats his folly. That's such a powerful image. That analogy or that illustration, that the writer gives a dog going back to something that is vile. And for us thinking about the need to see the reality of our sin? Do we acknowledge our sin as something that is repulsive? Do we see it as something that is disgusting? Do we view it as vomit like a dog returning to vomit? Or have we accepted our sin and dress it up or disguised it as something that is, is not so bad, it becomes our little pet that we bring out every now and then when we feel like we need a break. I find myself calling it something else. I say it's catching up with friends. And really, it's gossip. We say I want to provide for the family. But really the driver behind that is is greed. It's covetousness. We think to ourselves, this isn't hurting anyone. But yet we commit adultery in our heart. And we minimize and rationalize sin. It doesn't seem like a big deal to us. But as Paul said in Romans chapter six, and verse 23, The wages of sin is death. That's ultimately the path that it's leading down. And even though the serpent tried to convince Eve that she wouldn't die, there were consequences for her actions. When my tongue tears, someone else apart when my heart becomes filled with anger, or wrath, or my eyes get filled with jealousy or envy of someone else, you know what's happening to me in those moments as I am becoming a slave, we become enslaved to our sin. In Romans chapter six, in verse 16, it says, Do you not know that if you present yourselves to anyone as obedient slaves, you are slaves to the one whom you obey either of sin which leads to death or of obedience, which leads to righteousness? That's the reality of what's occurring, we become captive, we are controlled by our desires. And we think, Well, this is just isolated, it's small, it's not a big deal. But things that are left unchecked, things that are left alone are not addressed. They continue to grow and grow. complaining and bitterness and pry. If those things are watered, they lead to more complaining bitterness and pride, they become stronger. And thinking about the reality of sin, it's not something that just affects me. Often. I think this is just my struggle or my issue, but sin almost always has a ripple effect. There are people that are in the

Conrad Harkrider  24:47
in the area around us that are being impacted by that. Family, friends, other members at church, our spouses, They are affected or impacted by the things that we choose to do. Acknowledging the truth about sin should change our minds about it so that we see it in a different way. When we see the reality, it should cause us to say, this is a big deal. This is a problem. And something that I once enjoyed doing, or I didn't mind so much should now become something that is a pourraient. It's repulsive to me. When I was in college, there was a local pizza place that we used to go to. And on Sundays, they would have an all you can eat buffet of pizza, which for a guy in college, unlimited food source, that's a pretty good deal. And I remember one Sunday, we went there to eat dinner, and I was doing my my typical routine, loaded up on the pizza hammer, and on the pizza rolls, they had this dessert pizza that you could get, and I was filling up as much as I possibly could. I went home later that night, went to bed. And about an hour after falling asleep, I woke up and I was horribly sick. And no details necessary, right. But it whether it was food poisoning, or the stomach bug, but I was up the entire night. Now, after I recovered and felt better, the next time someone said, Hey, let's go to the local pizza place. What do you think my response was? I don't eat at the local pizza place anymore. Right? And nothing had changed about it. They were still making great pizza, they were putting cheese on it and it was all you could eat. But you see my mindset, my attitude towards it had changed. I viewed it differently. I saw it in a different way. And can we view our sin in the same way? That's really the challenge to view something that once brought us delight and pleasure, we now see it as something that makes our stomach turn. We say I can't eat that anymore. That makes me sick. Seeing the reality of our sin. Also, notice what Paul says in Galatians chapter six and verse nine Galatians six and verse nine. Let us not grow weary of doing good for in due season we will reap. If we do not give up. In the struggle against sin we need to remember to not give up, don't give up. Stick with it. We often think about being stubborn as a bad trait. We don't want to be stubborn people. But there's a sense in which Christians must have an element of stubbornness of stick to itiveness where we say I'm not going to quit on this I'm not going to give up or stop trying or continuing to make the effort to get this right. In first Corinthians 15 In verse 58, Paul talks about being steadfast, and immovable, that doesn't mean that we're perfect, but our direction and our leaning towards God it continues we stay on that path or we we continue moving towards God despite wavings or mistakes that we make. Keep in mind that making change in our life is extremely difficult. It's extremely difficult. It's not like I can wake up one morning and say okay, all bad thoughts are gone and now only good thoughts. It's more difficult than that. We've maybe spent years of our life in graining ourselves in some type of habit or behavior or indulgence, those roots are sinking deep into our heart. And it's going to take time to remove those things. Our attitude should be that we have died to sin that the old man is no more but that doesn't take away from the reality of having to remove those things and try to deal with them on a daily basis.

Conrad Harkrider  29:35
So the point is when you get in there and you're trying to pull out the thornbush of sin, don't be surprised when there are cuts and scrapes and there is pain along the way sin is difficult to remove. But don't give up. Don't give up When Peter asked the Lord, he said, How many times should I forgive my brother, if he sins against me? Peter said seven times, Peter probably thought he was being generous by offering more than a couple. You remember what Jesus responded 70 times seven. He wasn't giving him a specific number. He's basically saying, as many times as it takes, that's how many times you should forgive your brother. You ever thought about where Jesus got that standard from where that comes from? It comes from the throne of God. That's exactly how God deals with us, and we should deal with others. But sometimes in my struggle against sin, I get to the fourth or fifth time of stumbling, and I say I'm, I'm going to quit. I'm giving up on myself. There's no more forgiveness. Peter is not your Lord, Jesus Christ, who offers immeasurable grace, His grace can cover any sin. And as long as we are willing to get back up and to continue on, and serve Him, He's there to help us. He's there to forgive us, and provide the strength we need, don't give up. And finally, Acts, chapter four and verse 32, we look at the early church, the full number of those who believed were of one heart and one soul, and no one said that any of the things that belong to him was his own, but that they had everything in common. We think about overcoming the struggles, we need to remember to build relationships with other Christians. What you see in the early church, after people accept the gospel, they come to Christ. There in the faith, there is this amazing bond that is formed, he says that they are of one heart of one soul, they are unified, they are joined together, they're sharing everything, and that points to a relationship. Their lives now become interconnected. Part of building relationships is surrounding ourselves with good influences. We need to be around people who are trying to do what's right. Trying to serve God trying to make good decisions, trying to follow his will, when you're the only person who's trying to stand for what's right, it becomes difficult. So building relationships that are positive, and that will increase our faith is important. We also need to build relationships, because in the fight against sin, isolation, and secrecy are some of the devil's greatest weapons. When we try to face our struggles alone, our chances of success go way down. We need others to encourage us to lift us up. And that starts by attending service. This is a time where we hear God's word we sing songs, we pray together, we have fellowship, it's a time of of encouragement, we need to come together. But it's extends outside of the church building, where we interact and we connect with people on a on a personal level to build that, that trust and that support. And so I encourage you to ask somebody to go to lunch, invite someone over for dinner, take time out of your schedule to connect with other Christians to build those relationships. When I played sports, we used to have to do these really intense workouts. We call them circuit workouts.

Conrad Harkrider  34:23
And typically it was early in the morning six o'clock, you had to be there and they would set up different stations. So you'd be doing push ups and then you jump up on a box and then you'd have to do sit ups and jump rope and whatever it was and about five minutes into that you were starting to feel like I'm through with this. I'm done. I'm gonna quit but you never did. You moved on to the next station and you kept going and looking back on it and thinking of addicts. Why didn't we give up? Why don't we just throw in the towel and say I'm not doing this wasn't because of the coach yelling at us. It wasn't my desire to get in shape and be stronger. It was because of the guy next to me. The people around me they weren't giving up. They were pushing through they were going on. And so if they can stick with it, then so can I. That's important for us to have those relationships, to not isolate ourselves to continue to fight the battle against sin together. It's not something to be waged alone. We're going to conclude this morning with an invitation. And it's an opportunity. It's a an opening for inviting people to ask for prayers to draw closer to God. And if it's not something that you do publicly, then reach out to someone privately. make that connection with a brother or sister and build that relationship so that you can overcome sin. Jesus has made a way for us by giving his life on the cross. If we come to God and humility in repentance that we can be forgiven of all wrong, and stand before the Lord blameless. There's something that we can do to encourage you in your walk. Please come down to the front as we stand and see
