One an uplifting period of worship that we've engaged in this morning. This is what God created a sport, to shout his praises to give him the honor and the glory that is due his name to study his word. We're encouraged that we studied this point to see the gospel spread through the Roman Empire as we've been studying the book of Acts that the God The Gospel is spreading people obey the gospel churches are being planted. So God is a powerful God, appreciate the songs were led this morning, the message at the Lord's table, we need to be reminded that we serve an awesome God, we're here to honor him to glorify Him, and all that we do this morning. What would you think if I told you that you could have perfect peace? We say that again. What would you think if I told you you could have perfect peace in your life in spite of the trials and struggles, the temptations, the burdens, the sicknesses, all that stuff? You could have perfect peace, Pease, like we just saying a minute ago. But who wouldn't want that? We all want that several of us on Friday night heard art Adams, down in Franklin addressed a very common issues of anxiety and depression, to the very good job with that he reminded us that not only these things common in the world are common in the Lord's church, the common among us too common in me, I have to work very hard to train myself not to be anxious about my life, perhaps you feel the same way. Jesus admonished us in the Sermon on the Mountain not to be worried not to be fearful not to be anxious, yet we can struggle with all these things. Well, Isaiah, chapter 26, God makes a remarkable promise to his people, as they would be coming out of captivity, returning to their land, he promised them perfect peace, and actually as a promise that God gives to each of us today. And so this morning, I want to focus on this idea of achieving perfect peace from Isaiah chapter 26, verses three and four. And so what we're going to do this morning is just look at this text, the really the, the brief text over here, and look at the messages or the message that God is trying to communicate to each one of us. This is my favorite type of preaching. Where we just mind the scriptures, just let God's word speak to us. This is called expository preaching, or exegetical preaching. That's to sound too fancy sounding word for me. So we just want to look at the word of God and let it let it speak to us. And so in Isaiah chapter 26, and just a few verses over there, Isaiah gives a remarkable promise to the people of Judah, coming out of captivity, that they can have this type of peace and comfort and assurance that they're looking for. And again, by extension, we can have the same we can achieve the same promise today receive that today in terms of having the perfect peace that helps us in the difficult trials that we face. So let's look at Isaiah chapter 26. I'm going to read a few verses here, the first five verses, they're going to put this the text up on the screen, as we discuss that this morning. And so this is a song of trust for God's protection. It says in that day, the song will be sung in the land of Judah. We have a strong city he sets up walls and ramparts for security. Open the gates that the righteous nation may enter the one that remains faithful. In verse three the steadfast of mine, you will keep in perfect peace, because he trust in you trust in the Lord forever. For him God the Lord, we have an everlasting rock, where he is brought low, those who dwell on hide the unassailable city, he lays it low, he lays it low to the ground, he cast it to the to the dust. So this is our text this morning. And I'm going to abbreviate that just two verses three and four. I've got the ESV up on the screen, I just read the New American Standard Version But the basically saying the same thing. So I want you to focus with me this morning, by just a couple of verses in Isaiah chapter 26, as it gives us a brings us a very relevant message relating to the peace that we so often forfeit, and often because we don't carry that to God and prayers me sometimes sing, but this is a text we're looking at. Isaiah chapter 26, verses three and four is used. Look at that kind of outline naturally on Scripture. We're gonna basically look at each of these lines. And notice the message that God is giving you and me That's it was a message for Judah, who would eventually come out of captivity, but it's really a message for you and me today. So he said you keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on you because he trust in you. Trust in the Lord for ever. For the Lord God is an everlasting thing rock, think about what that means. The first thing I want to suggest to you that God is the source and provider of this piece, this is not something that we do ourselves. That God is the one who provides us with this piece. Again, look at the text over here in verse three. It says, you keep him

Mike Roy  05:19
in perfect peace. It's not something that I do myself, because I have great faith. I don't don't have that great faith often. But this is something that God provides to us. And for the ones who are putting their trust in God. It says it's you keep him in perfect peace. It was reminded that this is not our own doing. We've been studying the book of Philippians, on our Wednesday night class, the well known verses scriptures, Paul deals with adversity in trial and poverty, in abundance and all that in Philippians, chapter four, he makes that statement to be a second do everything, right, that can do everything. Nobody says I can do everything. Through Him. That's how we live. That's how I live. We do everything through God by His power. So when we look at Isaiah chapter 26, it says, The steadfast of mine, you will keep in perfect peace. That is DoD is the one who provides the peace that we really need. And one other pass that we've been looking, in fact, this past Wednesday night or a class. Paul said, Therefore, my beloved, as you have always obeyed, so now not only as in my presence, but much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling, for it is God who works in you both to will and to work for His good pleasure, reminder, that is, as these Christians at Philippi, we talked about that this morning in our class, as Livia in the Philippian jailer, we're growing in their faith, they need to understand that God was working in them. And the truth is, God is working in you, and God is working in me, and God provides ultimately, perfect peace. So we need to recognize that principle. Sometimes we think there's no way that I can get perfect peace. That's true, if you're the source of that peace. But if God's the source of your peace is perfect, is complete, its whole. So that's the first point I want us to realize that God is the source of this peace. And then secondly, I want to suggest that, that God provides total and complete peace. Again, going back to our Texas as you keep him in perfect peace. We can read that and we're blue in the face, but we got to stop and think about that. So what he's saying over here is that God gives us total and complete peace of mind. That's perfect peace. We just sang that song appreciate Trevor leading that for me this morning. I want to just read a few of these verses again, there's so compelling to think about, it says Peace, perfect peace in this dark world of sin. The blood of Jesus whispers peace, within verse three peace, perfect peace with sorrows surging round, on Jesus bosom, not but calm is found in verse for peace, perfect peace with loved ones far away. In Jesus keeping, we are safe. And they first five P's perfect peace, our future all unknown. Jesus, we know and he is on the throne. And then a verse six, it is enough, Earth struggles, she soon shall cease. And Jesus calls us to heavens, perfect peace. And we sang this one we see Him face to face, we see the face of God, we touch the face of God, we embrace our Father in heaven. And so we look at this passage over here. We realized that a God provides not just a small amount of peace, He gives us perfect peace, complete peace. Again, I'm going to be making some references to the book of Philippians that we've been studying on Wednesday night. So Philippians chapter four, verses six and seven. This is what Paul says to these Christians at Philippi would be anxious for nothing, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God, and the peace of God, that were Tamati and the peace of God which surpasses all comprehension. This is I believe, the perfect piece that Isaiah is talking about. So Isaiah through a God is promising through Isaiah, his people receive perfect peace in Paul says the same thing, that you get perfect peace, the peace that surpasses all comprehension. guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus. So as a reminder, secondly, that, that God provides total and complete peace. I know you've got lots of question marks sorting swirling in your mind, say, Mike, I just, I see what you're saying, How do I get that? What

Mike Roy  10:19
do I do to get that? What's the process of getting there? Because the reality is very often we were not filled with complete peace, we're filled with worry and doubt and fear and anxiety and all those things. But we're looking at a text that is giving us giving us some instructions about this perfect peace. And we want you to see, though, by terms of motivation for us that the type of peace that God gives us is complete, it is total. Now the third point I want to make is that the requirement for us is to fix our eyes on him to fix our eyes on Jesus. So go back to the text, it says you keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on the is what the King James Version says, you keep him in perfect peace whose mind is fixed on you, Oh, mighty God. And when our minds are fixed on God, then we can have the peace that surpasses all comprehension. We're talking about developing a steadfast mind some other translations put it that way. It's a mind that is focused on God. It is a result of conscious daily choices and decisions. It doesn't come easily. But it comes through intentional living and wholly living and taking God's word and pressing it into our hearts this year. Our theme is what a conda, congregational theme is seeing Jesus in 2020. Well, this passage is right in the middle of the row that this is, this helps us to achieve that very thing. This is how we see Jesus with clear vision and 2020. We have our minds that are focused on Him fixed on him and not swayed away. Now, I want to say again, being transparent and relevant at times in my life, I have this the steadfast thinking I'm fixed on God. But many other times I'm not My mind wanders away from that in the trials and the temptations come my way. And all of a sudden, I'm not I don't have that piece. And I'm anxious and worried and all that type of thing. So we realize that the requirement then is for us to to fix our mind, on God that means a daily activity, a daily decision. James reminds us in chapter one, verse eight, that a double minded man is unstable in all his ways. So we don't want to be double minded brethren. We want to be single minded we but we must have a steadfast mind and a single focus. I want to just very quickly, not going to read this but just kind of recounting the story in Matthew chapter 14, where Jesus had was with his disciples who was going to go across the lake, but he wanted to spend time in prayer. So he goes up on a mountain he's in the evening time he's praying is all by himself. The boats halfway across the lake. And what happens is now battered by the storms arise and a boat is rocking. The disciples are terrified about maybe drowning, their lives are going to come to an end. And Jesus is walking on the water. And they said, it's a ghost. It's a ghost. They're terrified. And Jesus says, Take courage. It is I do not be afraid. And then Peter, the, the compulsive one in lots of ways and but a man with with a strong faith in leadership, said Lord if it is you command me to walk on the water. And Peter stepped out of the boat. Well we sometimes we make fun of Peter and we give him a hard time because he sank and all but Peters the only one that stepped out of the boat. Everybody else was sitting in the boat afraid and terrified. So he said to Jesus, if it is you command me to walk in water Peter stepped out of that boat and started walking on the sea. walking and walking and all of a sudden you saw the wave probably heard the saw the windy heard the waves, and then he started to sink in doubt and fear. The paint the reason I say that is because Peter story is your story. Peters faith is your faith. Peters failures are your failures. Peters COURAGE is your courage. The story is told for us because we are just like Peter, at times I say Lord commanded I walk on the water, and I'm strong and courageous and preach God's word to help save souls. And then there's times I'm fearful and anxious about my life. It's terrible to go for those extra but that's that's human nature. But that's why I say Peter story Is your story.

Mike Roy  15:01
And we relate to him in so many ways. And so the challenge is for us, if we're going to develop, you know, this perfect, we want to receive the perfect piece, this is a promise from God. How do we achieve that? Well, we've got to develop a stead fast faith. That means reading God's word, worshiping, like we're doing together, memorizing God's word. But from a technology standpoint, we need to lock our radar on Jesus. So radar, what that does in different types of radar technologies, so the radar will send out a signal, and it will kind of scan the horizon and they want to find this object that locks on it. Now when I was in Japan, many years ago, I was a radar technician and we were servicing the p3 aircraft, this a kind of a big aircraft, and it would basically around the island of Okinawa, there would be Russian submarines would come around, and they would, you know, circle the island. And so would send the the p3 aircraft up in the air and the radar technician up there, the operator would actually be sending out the signals, and it did locate a submarine that dropped the son of boys every time they get a location, that kind of kind of pinpoint where the where the submarine was. He one time I think I was talking to a radar operator, I was a radar technician, but when the time was talking to radar operator, and he said that they had locked on to a submarine Russian submarine for 48 hours. That's a long time back. This is 40 years ago, a long time ago. But that's what radar done. So we're saying, that's what we need to do. We need to lock our radar on Jesus, and on God, our Father in heaven. And so that's the whole idea that the requirement for us to achieve this type of perfect peace is a steadfast mob, we can't be wishy washy. We can't say I'm going to serve God today. And then tomorrow, I'm not going to serve God, we can't do that type of thing. So this is the requirement that we need to have. Again, going back to Philippians chapter four, just making a lot of references since we've been studying then on a Wednesday night class. Now this what Paul says to these Christians at Philippi says finally brothers, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is just whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is commendable, if there is any excellence if there's anything worthy of praise. He said, think about these things. What are you thinking about? What are you dwelling on? What do I dwell very often not these things, things that are not wholesome, that are not always true listening to gossip, and all the stuff that we all do from time to time. But he says that we need to be thinking about these things, Other translations say, let your mind dwell on these things. And he said, what you have learned and received and heard and seen in me, practice these things. It was the result of that. He said, and the God of peace will be with you. So we achieve perfect peace, by this trust, and basically fixing our minds on God looking unto Jesus Hebrews chapter 12, and verse three, looking after him, we're fixing our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of our faith. When we do that type of thing, we can receive that peace. And so again, I want to make a connection here is that Philippians chapter four, verses eight and nine, is really a picture of what the steadfast buying of Isaiah chapter 26, verse three is all about. So when Isaiah says, The steadfast of mind, you will keep in perfect peace. What does that look like? This is what it looks like right here, thinking on God's word, things that are wholesome, pure, right, just all those things and practicing these things. So the steadfast of mind is a person who does all these things. On a regular basis, none of us do it perfectly, obviously. But that's this is a good picture of what Isaiah is talking about. So the, the requirement for us is been to, to fix our eyes on Jesus, to look unto Jesus to see Jesus in 2020. That's our theme this year, to see Jesus every day as a glorified Christ in our lives, but the fourth point I want to bring out from this text this morning. Again, another key the key to perfect peace is endless trust and a powerful God. So again, look at this text with me. It says you keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on you because he trust in you. So trust is the basic requirement that we have when need and serving God and in achieving the peace. But in verse four, he says,

Mike Roy  19:55
Trust in the Lord for ever. I will stop right there before we get to the last Verse, the last part of the verse. So the the requirement or the key to perfect peace is this forever trust, trusting in the Lord always, not just an easy time, but in bad times, hard times difficult times. So again, perfect peace will be achieved when we have endless consistent trust, and are powerful in mighty God. And so, if we want to have perfect peace, that means that we need to develop this constant, endless trust in God. If we want to have constant peace need constant trust, another verse that we might look at to give us some more reinforcement here, reinforcement in First Chronicles chapter 16, verses nine through 12. The writer says, sing to him, sing praises to Him, tell us tell, of all his wondrous works. glory in His holy name. Let the hearts of those who seek the Lord rejoice. Seek the Lord in His strength. And then in verse live and seek His presence continually seek His presence continue to remember the wondrous works that he has done, His miracles and the judgments he uttered, God wants us to remember all of the ways he has delivered his people throughout all history. And if he delivered his people throughout all history, guess what? He will deliver you we seen this, and sometimes he is able to deliver the and that's why it's so important to recite the constant works of God and see his power in creation and all the things that he has done, has done throughout history. One of the aspects though, is to seek His presence. And that's what we're doing this morning. And that's why we'll try to come back this evening. And then Winston, we seek God's presence, continually because that's where your pieces bound. And when we first say God's assembly and forsake His Word, we get ourselves into a heap of trouble. So piece perfect piece is achievable. And and the reminder is that we need to have a continuing trust in God one of the points that I want to make before we wrap up the lesson this morning and extend the invitation, I want to again suggest that from the last part of verse three, that our God is eternally steadfast, unchanging, immovable, I want you to think about that for a second. Our God is eternally steadfast, unchanging and immovable. So it says, you keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on you, because he trust in you trust in the Lord forever. So what image does Isaiah give us of God in this verse? For the Lord God is what is an ever lasting rock. That means he doesn't change, he doesn't crumble, he doesn't fade, he doesn't fail, he doesn't vanish. He is unchanging, he is steadfast, he is immovable, which gives us great confidence and hope. And a God who is so unchanging. And so because he is an everlasting rock, I can rest on Him. I can put my hope in him, I can trust him, he's not going to change. And we don't have to worry about our lives. We don't have to live in fear and doubt and anxiety, which is what so often I do, or you may do as well. But But God is an eternal rock with a powerful image, we sometimes sing a song called Rock of Ages, Rock of Ages, cleft for me, let me hide myself in the not much more powerful image there. Rock of Ages, for all eternity, God is an everlasting rock. No one else is not you don't mean we're all weak, we have our struggles, but God's is God is an eternal rock. Wow. So it gives such some such comfort to me and encouragement. So I hope this passage in Isaiah chapter 26 has been helpful for you. Again, the challenge the question is, as we extend invitation this morning is this question is your mind stayed on him?

Mike Roy  24:36
Is your heart fixed on Jesus Christ? Are you seeing Jesus in 2020? That's the challenge for each one of us. Maybe that you're here this morning and you've taken your eyes off Jesus and turned away looking at the world looking at work or whatever it might be. We encourage each each of us to keep our eyes turn our eyes back onto God back on to Jesus Christ if you want to be saved more stems. We've got to look at Jesus. Look is where we must obey the gospel of Christ by believing that Jesus is the Christ repenting of our sins, confessing our faith in him and then submitting to God's command to be baptized to have our sins forgiven. If you've done that you need prayers for your struggles, and maybe they just help you keep your eyes on Jesus. We're here to assist any way that we can. You might come always stand and sing the invitation song
