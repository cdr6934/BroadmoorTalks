Just turn to the book of Luke, chapter five. So before we start, I'd like to talk a little bit about curiosity. So as most of you know, my family is rather large. And it was one day we were particularly curious about something. So in some sort of book, and we were homeschooled, so we write all sorts of different things, and many different places. And we had a hobby farm, in which we tried a whole bunch of different things had big garden had a bunch of animals. And so we had an electrical fence. Now, an electric fence basically keeps the cows in, and there's a shock that goes through each of it. If you take a piece of grass, just the blade and put it against it, you just have this nice little switch that you fill. Well, we had this very interesting idea that we read in some book that if you create a chain of people, that every everybody in between, except the last person would not feel the shock. So after coaxing all of my siblings, and the youngest, of course, being at the back, created a chain, which I was at the front and, yeah, it was not what the book said.

Unknown Speaker  01:43
We all

Unknown Speaker  01:47
had tears, we'll just say that. But I think the element of curiosity is something that's really important, and something that we'll see here in John. So or, in lieu, I will probably interchange the name for some reason, my brain has the association with that. So I just apologize in advance. So by the seed, we follow. So let's start by reading Luke 5123. On one occasion, while the crowd was pressing in on him to hear the Word of God, he was standing by the leg of canasta breath. And he saw two boats by the lake, but the fishermen had gone out of them, and were washing their nets, getting into one of the boats, which was Simon's he asked him to put out a little from the land. And he sat down and taught the people from the boat. So what we see here first is this is early in Christ's ministry or Jesus's ministry on the earth, he had just come from cat perineum, and he was in that air area to heal people. And we see that he had the number of confrontations and healing, which obviously stirred a bunch of buzz in the area. There were casting of unclean spirits. And it was also run out of his home, as Luke 416 30 says, which obviously created some sort of buzz, people were interested into seeing what was happening and what was occurring. Who is this Jesus, this prophet, this son, you know, follower of John, this, maybe manifestation of Elijah, and it attracted a great crowd. And when Jesus had a big crowd, he would speak the word of God. And as we continue, we have to think about John, so he obviously had been all night, on the or on the sea, Lake of Nazareth. And it was a frustrating night for him. He hadn't caught any fish. He had been there all night, and he had just finished. And now you see that Jesus wanted to use his boat, and he was pushed out he was taught there. Now we could say that he would have automatically gone home, but due to the fascination of this, Jesus, he continued on and listen. And so we go, Luke four through five. And when he had finished speaking, he said to Simon, put out into the deep and let down your nets for a catch. And Simon answered, Master, we toiled all night and took nothing. But at your word, I will let down the nets. Now we see Simon here, he is a bit reluctant, but he continues to fall in. Obviously, Peter was interested. If he wasn't and he could have used any would have excuse. He could have said, well, I'm exhausted and frustrated. I worked here all night, and I'm ready to go home. It could have been unnecessary work, he realized that the hedges cleaned the nets. And if he threw it out, and being that he was a professional fisherman, was going to have to prove Jesus wrong. He obviously could have used that as an excuse in life, he needed to get back home, or here was a prophet, he might not have been a whole lot of interests, he was just the guy from Nazareth. But we do see that Simon had a causative attitude and wanted to know more. Even though we see a Peter might not have completely believed Jesus. He knew what he was doing. After all, Jesus was a carpenter and not a fisherman. And we think about people in the entire testaments, we think of Moses, before he went in to lead the people out of Israel. He was skeptical, he was reluctant about what it was that he was to do. Exodus three, this is just as Jesus or as Moses had been at the burning bush and had been called, good reads, But Moses said to God, Who am I that I should go to Pharaoh and bring the children of Israel out of Egypt? Here we see, of course, Moses being a great leader, and yet he was skeptical about it.

Unknown Speaker  06:38
And skepticism, skepticism or reluctance is probably a good thing to have. For all of us. We shouldn't just take everything at face value, we should always study, we should always know and be approved of ourselves, of what we are reading and what we are learning and what we are teaching. In Philippians, Paul coins it as their form of Beloved, as you have always obeyed. So now, not only as in my presence, but much more in my absence, working out your own salvation with fear and trembling. So we continue on and Luke five, six, and seven. And when they had done this, they enclosed, a large number of fish. And their nets were breaking, they signal to their partners, and the other boats to come and help them. And they came and filled both the boats so that they began to sink. We can say, listening and do doing can surprise us. But what's most important is the wiggling heart. It's the willing heart that God will work in. Otherwise, if we find no interest in him, he really cannot help us. Early in his ministry, when he was in Nazareth, teaching the people and Luke Luke four, he was run out of His own hometown, because they were enchanted or in charmed by the way that Jesus was healing people, and reads the love for 28. One they had heard these things all in the sacred synagogues were filled with wrath. This was after Jesus had told them that he was not going to perform any miracles in the town that he says, And they rose up and drove him out of the town and brought him to the brow of the pill on which their town was laid, so that could could throw him down the cliff. And obviously, he's escaped from that. But obedience can really surprise this. If we think about in the case, we see Jesus use the miracles to essentially sink the boat and break the net nets. There's an element of shock that is used to knock us into wrong sentences. Sometimes it takes shocking events to for us to see our past or our own insufficiencies. Sometimes we get stuck in our everyday lives letting our lives being set on autopilot. And this shock that we see is, not only did they catch a whole lot of fish, they caught so many fish that it was to the point of sinking the ship and their nets being broken as well. And we see the same thing with naman in Second Kings 511. We see that he coming from Syria was told by one of his slave girls, that there was a prophet in the land of Israel, who was able to heal him who had leprosy. Now he goes down there and of course he, as a commander felt that he deserved the ability to have a one on one confrontation with Alicia however it In this case, Alicia uses his servant to speak to him and say, go down, dip yourself seven times in the Jordan. And namens response was, while he was angry and went away, saying, Behold, I thought that he would surely come out to me and stand and call upon the name of the Lord his God, and wave his hand over the place. And here the leper are not too bad on five par, the rivers of Damascus, better than all the waters of Israel, could I not wash in them and be clean. So we turned and went way into rage. The servant came and calmed him down and eventually went down to the Jordan and dipped himself seven times and was cleaned.

Unknown Speaker  10:51
Listening and doing can surprise us. It is through obedience that we will find surprising things that occur in our lives. Now, this is not a true statement all the time. Sometimes that's not true at all for many years. But it's obedience in which we find our way to God. Continuing in the story, but when Simon Peter saw it, he fell down at Jesus knees, saying, Depart from me, for I am a sinful man, oh, Lord, for he and all who were with him were astonished at the catch of fish that had been taken. So we see two reactions. One we see, Simon Peter, say, Woe is me, I am a sinful man. Now, this was a reaction of, or maybe a realization of his unworthiness when it comes to light of God. It enables us to have a sense of humility and bowing of our wills that allows us to give to the will of God and the ability to accept God's ways over others. It was this miracle that just was performed that had an impact on his life, not only did he probably have the biggest catch of his own life, he had probably the biggest catch recorded in the entire sea of Nazareth, which had a lasting effect on him and those around him, we see a similar response by job. After a God showed him all the elements of the world, he said, I had heard of you by the hearing of the ear, but now my eye sees you. Therefore I despise myself, and repent in dust and ashes. The second reaction was astonishment and fear. As we saw earlier, experiencing a miracle might be unsettling. It brings light to the authority of God and has control of nature's elements of the earth. And the gospel should place into us a position of realizing that only our God has the power to create or destroy. When we see that there is something outside of this world in front of us and realize it. We see that Zachariah had the same reaction earlier in the book. And when the angel came down to tell of the birth of John, even though he was old. It says Zachariah was troubled when he saw him and fair fell upon him. But the angel said to him, Do not be afraid Zachariah for your prayers have been heard and your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son. And you shall call his name John. And we see the same sort of reaction to this power, this divine power when Mary was greeted by an Angel Gabriel and she says it came to her and said greetings a favorite one. The Lord is with you. But she was greatly troubled that the same and tried to discern what sort of greeting this might be.

Unknown Speaker  14:21
Then it looked 510 We see something and I read so also are James and John sons of Zebedee who were partners with Simon. And Jesus said to Simon, do not be afraid for now on you. From now on, you will be catching men. So what we see here is after this great miracle that Jesus had performed in front of them He asked them to go with him. And what happened? Well, they brought their boats to land, he left everything and followed him. Hard to understand for us nowadays to think that that was left. But if you think about this miracle, where your boat was just filled with as many fish as you probably possibly could ever have, and probably the market was probably not even large enough to hold these many fish, they realized that Jesus was have something that they did not. And it had an effect on them that they essentially followed. And I think what we can do is we can make a good parallel to this. When one hears the word, they're going to hear it either through coming to church were through Bible studies, or a random radio show or a conversation they had with a college roommate or anything of that nature. And it's in the same sense. Here in the story, we see that they heard the word Jesus had spoken the word to them. Then. Similar to fill up what he saw, in Acts 830, Philip had ran to the unit, he was on the road and there was a Ethiopian eunuch on his way back to Ethiopia, Ethiopia, and had been reading the book of Isaiah. And it reads, so Philip ran to him and heard him reading Isaiah the prophet and asked, Do you understand what you were reading? And he said, How can I, unless someone guides me and he invited Philip to come up and sit with him.

Unknown Speaker  17:24
Then we see, in verses four and five, we see Peter was reluctant. But he was skeptical enough and interested enough that it was going to ask on and then the same way, part of that road salvation is us asking more questions, we've been hooked. But now we have to continue to understand what is going on. And so we listen. Then, listening and doing can surprise. So in the same way that Peter and his fellow fishermen were surprised by the catch that they had. Also, we can continue to gain better understanding. And that is by sort of starting to pay attention, starting to listen starting to maybe obey what the gospel is saying. And then we have the reactions to the miracles. We saw that Peter was awestruck, and also full of realization of his insufficiencies. And there comes a point after we have learned God's word that we become convicted by it. It's in the conviction that we essentially become aware of our insufficiencies and become aware of our person in our lives. And then Jesus call Simon Peter, in verse 10, Jesus calls us to repentance as well. Luke, Peter, we see Peter and his disciples follow. And I think the question that we have to ask ourselves every day is what will we do?

Unknown Speaker  19:36
If we turn to x x two we see the same man. Peter, who had been a fisherman and probably very rambunctious sort of rationality, we see him give a lesson at Pentecost in Jerusalem. And essentially, he makes the case on why Jesus is here to stay, and that Jesus opened the gate for all to come not just for the Jews, but for everyone. And we would go to x to 38 is reads, And Peter said to them, Repent, to be baptized, every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ, for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. And that is a question or a call for all of us. We are called to follow Christ, to be baptized and to refer and repent from our sins. And it is a call for everyone here today. And something that we should clearly take note you try to understand or try done. So in closing, I want you to think about the question, What will you do? Will you follow Christ and give up everything that you have, that doesn't mean that we have to give up our jobs and then we start walking in the desert without anything. But it does mean that we start giving up our will completely and taking on a new will and that knew will is the will of God and what He has written in his word for us to understand and for us to follow and for us to ingest every day of our lives so that we can become more like Him so that we can be pleasing to Him. And so now the invitation is open to all here as we're about to see. Are you ready to take on that? And if not, you might have but you have been struggling with just ask that you open to someone and let them know that you are struggling so that you can follow and continually continue to follow that path that Jesus's life for us so that we might one day be with him and Heaven bless me try
