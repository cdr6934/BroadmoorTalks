Good morning, I certainly have a good crowd here today. It's always good when we can come in and worship our God appreciate very much. The fact that you're here helping me to worship God. And one of the things that a child can count on should be able to count on is that their parents hear them when they cry. We've experienced this a little bit lately, kids have had colds and been waking up at the night stuffing and they cry out, mom, dad, we've often joked even that, throughout the day, they cry out, mom, Jessica is thinking about changing her name for mom, because she hears it so often Mom, mom, as your will get in that little rut where other people are talking, he'll start Mom, mom, mom. And he won't stop telling myself a little bit here. I remember one time, when, you know, when kids are beginning to open and close doors, they, they can't always get it. But they they're starting to. And I remember one time when Clara had gotten into a room, and she couldn't open the door. And I was upstairs, I was somewhere away. And so she was crying out my name. And I wasn't there. Now remember, when I found there, it was about five minutes later, but I'm sure it seemed like an eternity to her crying out. And I wasn't there. I wasn't there to hear. And I vividly remember her tears and her feeling of desperation, and crying out and no one is there. Just as children should be able to count on their parents to hear their cry. I believe that God hears our cry. So I'd like to talk for just a few moments this morning about the fact that God hears God hears in Exodus, chapters one and two. And if you go ahead and open your Bibles there, and that's what we'll be spending the majority of our time this morning. I believe we see that powerful point that God hears God, here's in the first seven verses of Exodus, an Exodus we see that it lists the names of the sons of Israel who went from who came to Egypt. And it mentions the fact that that Joseph, who if you remember from the book of Genesis was one that rose to power in the second

Jeremy Sweets  02:35
seat of authority there in Egypt, because of the way that he had saved them during the famine, by interpreting the dreams of Pharaoh and the words of God. And it says in verse six that Joseph died, and his brothers and all that generation, and within them, verse seven, it says that the people of Israel are fruitful and increase greatly. They multiply and grew exceedingly strong, so the plan was filled with them. You'll see this way that the Hebrew text emphasizes a repeats over and over to make the point, the Israelites grew strong. And that is something that is familiar to us because in Genesis chapter 12, God had promised Abraham that he would make him a mighty nation. Well, here you see that coming to fruition, they are increasing, they are multiplying, they are becoming more and more and more, but notice verse saved. Now there are Rosa king over Egypt, who did not know Joseph, the Egyptians had been favorable towards Joseph because he had saved the people. They had appreciated what he had done. But now one grows up who either did not know his history, or more likely did not appreciate the work of this so called foreigner. In verse 19, said to his people, Behold, the people of Israel are too many and too mighty for us. Joseph has changed from one who had provided a benefit to now being a threat, Joseph and his family, the people of Israel. So notice what the king says, Come, let us deal shrewdly with them less they multiply, and if war breaks out, breaks out, they join our enemies and fight against us and escape from the land. Here we see that again, the king says, they may become too mighty for us, so we need to deal shrewdly with them. We need to deal shrewdly. In Exodus one and two, we see the outcome of this shrewd dealing that the king of Egypt places upon them, and you see that really in three different ways. First of all, he says, and it says in verse 11, therefore, they set taskmasters over them to afflict them with heavy burdens. They built for Pharaohs store cities Python, and Ramsay's Verse 12, but the more they were oppressed, the more they multiplied and the more they spread abroad, and the Egyptians were in dread of the people of Israel, verse 13. So they ruthlessly made the people of Israel work as slaves and made their lives better with hard work and mortar and brick, and all kinds of work in the field and all their work they ruthlessly made them as slaves. The first tactic or plan that the king of Egypt deals shrewdly with the people is he's going to make them work hard. In fact, he's going to work them so hard that it's going to diminish their numbers. Now, we see that his plan is foiled. When they increases the work, they actually increase in number, but his attempt here is to decrease the people or subjugate the people. And we see that in this first section. As I mentioned, that doesn't seem to work. So he moves on to plan to notice in verse 15, he talks to the Hebrew midwives. Then the king of Egypt said to the Hebrew midwives, one of whom was named shifren, the other Puah. When you serve as midwife to the Hebrew women and see them on the Birstall, if it is a son, you shall kill him. But if is a daughter, she shall live. So here's plan number two, he talks to the midwives, you need to simply kill the male sons that are born, that will help decrease the population that had already suffered through

Jeremy Sweets  06:32
difficult labor, extremely difficult labor. And now genocide is the plan, we will simply put them to death. Now, these Hebrew midwives that says in verse 17, feared God, and so they would not allow themselves to follow after the evil and wicked plans carrying out murder. They instead believed in God, and so they did not carry on with this plan. And it says that God dealt dealt well with the midwives in verse 20, because of what they did. And in verse 20, it also says in the people multiplied and grew very strong. Playing number through number two is foiled. His plan to put them to death is foil. Pharaoh is running the show here in chapter one. Well, in verse 22, says, Then Pharaoh commanded all the people, every son that is born to the Hebrews, you shall cast into the Nile, but you shall let every daughter live. And so here's the third plan, the Hebrew midwives didn't do their job. So now he's going to talk to the all all the people, and you need to simply throw or cast the sun in to the Nile. And so his evil plans really know no bounds. It's hard to put yourself in the place of the Hebrew people here, but can you can you imagine the suffering and the pain that they're experiencing, from someone that is seeking to hold them down, and they do it through ruthless work, slavery, and then through simply murder, genocide? Chapter Two, we see that that plan is foiled. In one sense, this Levites man and woman, when they have a son, they do put him into the Nile but not thrown to the death. In fact, it's just the opposite. Notice in chapter two and verse one, now a man from the house of Levi went and took as a wife took eight as his wife, a Levite. woman, the woman conceived and bore son and when she saw that he was a fine child, she hit him three months, when she could hide him no longer she took for him a basket made a bull rushes and dad that was bit Bitterman and pitch, she put the child in it and place it among the Reeves, by the reeds by the river bank. You'll notice that the word here and maybe some translation, say this is actually Ark, instead of basket. There's really only two times that that word Ark is used, and you'll probably remember the other one. In Genesis chapter six, the ark was the boat of safety for Noah, and here the Ark is this little boat of safety for Moses. We carry on through the story and the sister goes along with this baby as it is in the river. And notice what verse five says. Now the daughter of Pharaoh came down to the bay that the river while her young women walked beside the river, she saw the basket among the reeds and sent her servant woman and she took it. And when she opened that she saw the child and behold, the baby was crying. She took pity on him and said, This is one of the Hebrew children. And his sister said the Pharaoh's daughter, shall I go and call a nurse from the Hebrew women, the nurses child for you. And Pharaoh's daughter said to her go, so the girl went and called the child's mother. Here is the third plan cast all the children into the Nile River. But we see that this plan to is foiled. This plan is disrupted, and it's disrupted on many accounts. First of all these, this Levite couple that refuse to of course put their own child to death, they set their sister to watch some distance. But ultimately, this plan is foiled by the very daughter of the king, who looks upon the child and instead of throwing the child into the river to its death, she has compassion on the child. This throttling this foiling of the plan really will be carried out through the rest of the Exodus. First plan the heavy work that was foil because they continue to increase the second plan asking the midwives to put them to death that plan to was foiled because of their faith in God. And now we see this plan to put to death, to subjugate the people would result in Moses, who would lead his people away, lead them out of Egypt. And so not only was his life saved in that one particular plan foiled, but we see that he would foil the entire plan for the nation of Israel, to subjugate them.

Jeremy Sweets  11:28
What we see in chapters one and two, and Moses is actually after this, he is going to grow up and flee away because of an incident that occurs with him, flee away to the land of Midian. But what we see in chapter one really is Pharaoh calling the shots, he is moving the action, he has the plan, and he is seeking to carry it out, and we don't see God planning. We don't see God responding, at least it doesn't explicitly state that I do believe we see God in the text there. God is favorable to the midwives, God in Crete, or it says that the children visual increased in spite of the labor I think God had a hand in that. But Pharaoh is the one driving the action. He is the one speaking here's my plan. Let's do this. Here's my plan. Let's do this. But notice that the end of chapter two in verse 23, that says, during those many days, the king of Egypt died, and the people of Israel groaned because of their slavery, and cried out for help. Their cry for rescue from slavery came up to God. And God heard their groaning. And God remembered his covenant with Abraham, with Isaac and with Jacob, God saw the people of Israel and God knew the Israelites had suffered terribly through heavy labor, and also through attempted genocide, and possibly, there were those that were actually put to death. And they cried out to God, I wonder if they thought is God there? Is God listening? I wonder if they thought he must not be because we continue to suffer. We continue to face these problems. But notice what it says in verse 24, just as the text emphasizes that they grew and multiply and grew mightily, it uses the repetition of the words, it says that also about their labor, they were ruthlessly subjected to labor, all kinds of difficult labor, but now it's going to emphasize the point that God hears, God heard their groaning. It's going as mentioned for things in verse 24, and 25. This is not God distantly hearing. This is not God just using one of his senses, but God is going to experience and feel what they feel and hear what they cry out to Him. God heard their groaning it says, God remembered his covenant with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. God saw the people of God or of people of Israel, and God knew God knew God took note of God, notice them God did not ignore. You say that God, it almost uses all of the senses to incorporate the fact that God hears it's not just as ears hear, but God hears God remembers his promise. And so he's going to act upon that God saw the people of Israel and God knew God took notice of them.

Jeremy Sweets  14:56
Just as children rely upon their parents To hear them. When we open up the Bible on the text in Scripture we see that God hears God hears that is not only found in this passage, although I think it's very poignantly pointed out, it's really found all throughout Scripture. God hears his people. In Genesis chapter 16, in verse 11, you see that the first child of Abraham was called ich my L. You may have heard of the term the Shema from Deuteronomy chapter six. And that simply starts with the words here, oh, Israel. So you see that S H M A Shamar? Well, you see that in the name of ich my L, that s H M A, and that simply means God here there's an Israel was named that because God saw the affliction. It says, God, here, God heard, we see also when the temple was dedicated in First Kings chapter eight, that during the dedication, and will not go there and read that, but Solomon has a dedication of the temple. And one of the purposes or functions of the temple was when the people would pray, that God would hear when the people repented of their sins, and then they turn to God and pray, God would hear them and it mentions it over and over and over again. God hear God here. We see in Jeremiah, chapter 29, and verse 12, after the, the period of captivity, that the people would cry out to Him and He says, If you cry out to Me, I will here I will hear, ultimately, the prayers of those that go up to God are heard, are heard. And we need to be a people that are praying like that, and relying upon God because He is one that hears, and problems 15 In verse 29, a very general statement says, The Lord is far from the wicked, but he hears the prayer of the righteous, God, here, God here. Well, what can we learn from all this? I think there's a lot that we can take from this. And I want to look at simply four points as we consider this point that God hears. First of all, we need to trust in God trust. When we see a God that hears, and a God that cares and a God that loves we need to trust in his character and who he is, we need to know that about him. And it's one thing to mentally know that and it's another thing to trust in Him with your life. In First Peter chapter five, verses six and seven. First Peter, chapter five, verses six and seven, I believe there it connects our attitude with our how we will call upon God. First Peter five, verses six and seven, humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God so that at the proper time, he may exalt you, Casting all your anxieties upon Him because He cares for you. When we see God's greatness and His grand year, the tech says that we are to humble ourselves. Arrogant people don't pray, or they certainly don't pray like they should. They've got things figured out. They've got things under control, but those that humble themselves, the tech says, humble yourselves, therefore under the mighty hand of God. It goes on to say in verse seven, Casting all your anxieties upon him, those that are arrogant have no need or they think they have no need for God. But those that humble themselves, that trust in the Lord will cast their anxieties upon Him because He cares. In Proverbs chapter three, verses five and six, there it says, Trust in the Lord with all your mind. And do not lean on your own understanding. Do not lean on your own power, strength, wisdom, but rather trust in God. When we see a God who hears I think the first thing we need to do is trust, trust. The second thing we need to do and this may be the most obvious point of the lesson is pray.

Jeremy Sweets  19:38
For God to hear us, we need to be a praying people. We need to pray to God. First. Thessalonians five and verse 17, says pray without ceasing. So a question is, is there a time when prayer is not needed? Paul says no. pray all the time. Pray at all times. Pray Thanksgiving when things Sir Well, pray Thanksgiving when things are not well pray when you're facing trials and tribulations pray to God. Our prayers do a great deal of good in James chapter five. James chapter five and verse 16.

Jeremy Sweets  20:25
Prayers found throughout this passage, even starting in verse 17, as those that are sick, call upon the air elders to come there and pray. Verse 15 says the prayer faith will save the one who is sick and the Lord will raise him up verse 16. Therefore, confess your sins to one another and pray for one another that you may be healed. Now notice the end of verse 16. The prayer of a righteous person has great power as it is working. It has great power simply for the fact that God hears the power is not in the prayer. The one who prays the power is in the one who is prayed to. And that is Almighty God. Prayer is powerful because we pray to a powerful gong for 17 says Elijah was a man with a nature like ours and he prayed fervently that it might not rain in for three years and six months it did not rain on the earth. Then he prayed again and heaven gave rain and the earth bore its fruit. Pow, pray, prayer is powerful. We need to pray regularly, consistently. And we need to call out to God. We see throughout the scriptures, that God hears the prayers of those that call upon Him. So let us be those that call upon Him. Let us be those that praying. God hears but he can't hear a silent prayer or one that is not uttered, I should say. He must hear our prayers. And so let us pray. Third, I would suggest that we need to comfort others comfort others. God is one that hears us. God is one that hears and can provide comfort to us. And notice what Paul says in Second Corinthians chapter one, verses three through six, that that should have an impact upon us and how we treat other people. God hears us and maybe we can hear others and help others in their time of need. Notice in Second Corinthians one and verse three. It says Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies, and God of all comfort, who comforts us in all our affliction, so that we may be able to comfort those who are in any affliction, with the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted by God. For as we share abundantly in Christ's suffering, so through Christ we share abundantly in comfort to we are afflicted is for your comfort and salvation and if we are comforted, it is for your comfort which you experience when you patiently endure the same sufferings that we suffer our hope for you is unshaken, For we know that as you share in our sufferings you also will share in our comfort. Now Paul has a very particular idea of the comfort here provided this for those that are in suffering, and I think particularly suffering for their fangs. But I believe we could extend this in a general term to any type of suffering that we would face in the text says And Paul says that God has comforted me and one of the outgrowths of that is that Paul could comfort those that are suffering. God hears us. God hears when we pray, but we should also be listening. We should have our ears open to our brothers and sisters in Christ, those in the world that are reaching out to God and maybe we can provide comfort to them. Maybe we can provide a help to them. If God hears let us imitate his character, when we can't do everything God does. We don't have His power. We can't answer prayer like he does, but we can certainly lend a helping hand where we can and we can comfort. So let us trust Let us pray. Let us comfort but let us also respond. Let us respond to the gospel. There might be someone here this morning that's not a Christian. The Bible says that you need to call out to God call out to God and there's a particular way that you do that, that you call out to God in Acts chapter 22. Acts chapter 22.

Jeremy Sweets  24:58
And verse 16 As Paul recounts the time when he was when he saw Christ and when he was converted, and and is instructed, Paul saw the time when he came to him. He says, Now why do you wait, rise and be baptized and wash away your sins, calling on his name, those that would respond to the gospel message and submit themselves to the god and the great message of Christ. Here it says, they do that when they they call upon Him, when they are baptized into him. And I believe that encompasses really that whole process of being, submitting yourself to God's plan for salvation is a call to him. It is a calling out to him and for him to hear your prayer and wash away your sin. And so we do that by believing that Jesus is the Christ by repenting of our sins, confessing that Jesus is the Christ and being baptized into water for the forgiveness of our sins. No single step there is highlighted as the extremely important one, that whole process is needed. That whole process is a submission. That whole process is a calling upon God. That whole process is not an arrogant step where we expect to God to save us because we have committed some great act. And now he must save us, because of our goodness, that whole process instead is a submission. It is a calling out to God. And I believe God hears that calling out. And God will wash away your sins and wipe away your sin. And they may be that you're here this morning, and you are a Christian, and you're not living as you should. We see that the apostles instructed Simon, there that he would, after he had sinned, pray to God, God would here we also see in First John chapter one, First John chapter one, that those that are Christians have an avenue for forgiveness, and that is found in praying and reaching out and calling out to God and First John chapter one and verse seven. We walk in the light as He is in the light, we have fellowship with one another and the blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us from all sin. If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves and the truth is not in us. If we confess our sin, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness as Christians, we need not hide our sin from ourselves or deny that we've ever seen. But if we sin, the text says that we need to simply confess that, not hide it. That's our tendency, isn't it? To hide it, to bury it to act like it never happened? But here the text says, We must confess our sin, and He is faithful and just to forgiveness. God, here, God here. Is there someone this morning that's subject to the invitation? It's either not a child of God and needs to respond to the gospel message or someone that's not living as they should make your life right this very morning. Do not delay. There's anyone subject to an invitation please come as we stand insane at this time.
