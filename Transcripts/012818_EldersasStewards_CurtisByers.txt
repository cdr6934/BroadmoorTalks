If you would please open your Bibles to Acts of 20th chapter, we'll be reading a fairly lengthy selection for that chapter in just a moment. But first, let me again, welcome all who are here, it's good to see each of you today, it's always a special thing. To be able to come with God's people, the worship panel on this day, the first day of the week, at the beginning of the day at the beginning of our week, so glad you're able to join us to do that very thing. Let me begin reading first 17 Oh, read through the end of the chapter. So please follow on with me, we'll be taking a good part of our lesson from this chapter. So you might just want to keep your finger there throughout the course of our study. Paul is completing his third journey. He is in a rush to get back to through Islam and time for the feast. And he comes to the city of Meletus was just south of Ephesus. He could have stopped in Ephesus, but he doesn't want to do that, because he had been there for many years. And he knew the people there. Well, he knew that if he had stopped there, his his time would have been delayed. And so to avoid loss of that time, he goes to Miletus. But he calls for the elders of the church from Ephesus to come joining there. Yes, that is what I want to read about this morning. So beginning of verse 17, the text says and Acts chapter 20. Now from Miletus, he said to Ephesus, and call the elders of the church to come to Him. And when they came to him, he said to them, yourself, know how I lived among you the whole time, from the first day that I set foot in Asia, serving the Lord with all humility, with tears and with trials that happened to me through the the plus of the Jews, how I did not shrink from declaring to you anything that was profitable, and teaching you in public and from house to house, testifying both to the Jews and to Greeks, of repentance toward God and have faith that our Lord Jesus Christ, and now behold, I am going to Jerusalem constrained by the Spirit not knowing what will happen to me there, except that the Holy Spirit testifies to me in every city, that imprisonment and afflictions await me. By then I count my life of any value, nor has precious to myself, If only I may finish my course, in the ministry that I received from the Lord Jesus to testify to the gospel of the grace of God. And now behold, I know that none of you, among whom I have gone about proclaiming the kingdom will see my face again. Therefore, I will testify to you this day, that I'm innocent of the blood of all, Frontier, I did not shrink from declaring to you the whole counsel of God. Pay careful attention to yourselves into all flock, in which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers to care for the Church of God, because he obtained with his own blood. I know that after my departure fear fierce wolves will come in among you must bear in the flock, then from your own cells will rise, man speaking twisted things to draw away the disciples after them. Therefore be alert, remembering that for three years, it did not cease night or day to admonish every one with tears. And now I commend you to God went to the ward of His grace, which is able to build you up and to give you the herons, as among all those who are sanctified, a covenant no one silver or gold, or apparel, yourselves know that these hands minister to my necessities and to those who are with me, and all things I have shown you that by working hard in this way, we must help the weak and remember the words of the Lord Jesus, how he said himself, It is more blessed to give than to receive. And when he has said these things, he knelt down and prayed with them all. And there was much weeping on the part of all they embrace Paul, and kissed him. Being sorrowful, most of all, because of the word he has spoken, that they would not see his face again. And they accompany him to the ship. That is a sad passage that brings tears to your eyes, I think, to read of Paul's love for the brethren, and their love for him. And yet, although he in light of the fact that he clearly thought that he would never see them again, and whether he did or not, I really don't know. It kind of depends on how you read First Timothy and when you think that was written, but in any case, he believed that he would never see them again. But he had one thing more he wanted to tell them. And it must have been pretty important because my lead us was two days by journey from emphasis. So Paul is asking these men to take a week of their time to travel to him there in Meletus to listen to his words and to travel back home.

But he did not think that they would think it was about or, rather, he knew that it would be of joy to them, but more importantly to be a benefit to them. I want this morning to talk about the work of elders. And I think that looking at the things that are recorded here, within the middle portion of our reading, we can get a glimpse of what an elder is to do. In fact, I'm going to suggest that the terms that are used to describe elders, there are three different terms explicitly or implicitly, in this passage, that refer to the elders in their work. And I think if we understand those terms, we have a better understanding of who elders are what they are to do. The first term is elders is the term elder itself. In verse 17, Paul or Luke one calls for the elders there at the church of Ephesus, because we're the Greek word press, breeder us. And is, it was a normal word that would have been used to refer to older men and even older women. But it also had a technical side to it. Every Greek city was ruled by a body of elders, Jewish synagogues, had a group of elders who were over the synagogue. So it would not be unusual, then it was not unusual then to think that the Christians when they named those who would have some sort of leadership among them would also use the term elders. And that says, it refers to an office of elders. Now there are some people and even brethren who do not believe that there is anything any such thing as an office of an elder. They believe that this term elder only refers to the fact that there are older men and do their wisdom that they can exert some influence. Now you might can get away if you read this passage, you might come to that understanding, or at least not be contradicted and understanding. But if you go back a few chapters back to X chapter 14, they're in that place, Paul, and Barnabas has completed their first missionary journey, and they're going back to the cities. And we read their verse 23, that when they had appointed elders, for them in every church, with prayer and fasting, they committed them to the Lord and whom they had believe. Now, you don't appoint people to be old man, right? Time and calendar will take care of that for you. But you do appoint people to an office, you point people to a task and to a responsibility. It's always in that sense that I want us to think about the term elders, as that body of people who are given a special task or a special responsibility. And that culture, even more so especially more so today, than our culture, respect was given to one simply because they were older. One would refer to an older person simply because of their age, not necessarily because they were right or not necessarily because they were asking something that seemed reasonable, reasonable, you would defer to an older person, there's respect that will be given to an older person. And as but age, should bring with it, some experience, it should bring with it maturity, it should bring with it some lessons that people have people have learned and the wisdom to be able to deal with people in a good way. So when Paul, for example, gives the qualifications over First Timothy three and Titus one, he gets the qualifications for an elder from other those qualifications he says that they have to be married men, and not only married men, but they have to have children. And not only that, they have to be able to have children they have builded up have children who are faithful, or bleeding children and Titus, or children who are in subjection the way it reads in First Timothy, the third chapter. In other words, they have to be older children, having older children of necessity, bring some age, within that some experiences and some some learning to it. And when it also in First Timothy three, not only must a person have some experience in life, but a person to be an elder must have some experience as a Christian. And so Paul says that an elder is not to be a recent convert, not a novice, according to the way the King James, we translated it. So in some though the elder is one and the term elder suggests one who has maturity. One who has wisdom that comes with living.

Curtis Byers  09:57
Sometimes this word is also trans Slavery by the term presbyters was a transliteration of the Greek term. And that term is not trans used in any of our translations that I've done I'm aware of. And it's probably good because it's really not a better term. It's not when you read that, or we read the word or think of the word presbyter. It hides the fact that you're talking about an older person. And beyond that the term presbyter is used these days by different people in different ways. Among the Catholics, a presbyter is equivalent to a priests, the term is used interchangeably. And among the corpse of the Presbyterian Church, they refer to use that term to refer to their particular rulers or body rulers. So the term elders would be preferred. And so we'll just leave that other one all. There's another term though that's used in this passage as well. And actually 20 They're in verse 28. The text says, pay careful attention to yourself and to all the flock, in which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers, to care for the Church of God. Paul uses the term overseers in this passage to refer to elders. It comes from the Greek word Pisco pause, was the English Standard Version always translates as overseer, but the King James Version was just as likely to translate the word as bishop. But for the same two reasons, I believe overseer is the preferable term. I think the English Standard has a right in this case. It's transparent. The word itself tells you what a over overseers to do and overseers to oversee. And to the term bishop has been co opted by others to mean different things than what the Bible describes. And so it'd be best to stick with the term overseer. And understand that the overseers responsibilities have oversight. There are certain amount of understanding that brings to the process to understand that there is a job of overseeing of oversight that elders are to exercise within God's church. Now as the term overseer was a pretty general term, even in that day and time, it was been used in a wide variety of reasons. So it's not a term that was unfamiliar to the Christians. And so they wouldn't have a natural understanding of what the term would involve. Now, there's three things in this passage. There's any connection with overseers that we probably should take note of the first incidence there in verse 28. He says, that the Holy Spirit is the one who has made them overseers. He doesn't tell us how the Holy Spirit does as a naturally asked a question but wonder, well, how did the Holy Spirit make these men overseers? Well, I can think of two possible ways that he could have done that. I guess the Holy Spirit could have all could supernaturally identified these men to serve as overseers. He could have directly revealed the names of the means that he wished in this particular instance, that he would want to serve in that capacity. But I don't know if anything in the scriptures to support that idea. You know, we go back to the x 14 passage, when we read a Paul and Barnabas going from church to church to appoint elders, nothing is said in that context. So Holy Spirit, directly, telling Paul, who those elders would be. And but more telling, I think, is in first, when we have the qualifications of elders given over First Timothy three and Titus one. Why would you give qualifications, if you're going to be naming people by names, the very fact that you give qualifications suggest that you had a need to have a basis of which that selection can be made. So I simply take it, that the Holy Spirit appointed the elders in the sense that they revealed that overseers were needed. And they revealed on the basis of which overseers were to be selected. Suddenly, in this passage, it says that the elders are, are made overseers of the flock of which they are apart. You know, a lot of trouble has happened to the in through the time, when elders have one congregation start to take concerns about other congregations. That's not the Lord's will. That's not the Lord's Way. Elders are to be elders within their group, within the congregation of which they are part. They have no role, no responsibility beyond that. And the third thing that we see in this passage,

Curtis Byers  14:49
it says there in verse 2028, again, that overseers are to care for the Church of God. That's helpful, I think, was understand what elders are do but it's somewhat generic. And we're going to come back and ask and see what that term means more in just a moment. But in some this term, overseer is helpful, I believe, because it does suggest to us that there is some oversight that elders are to exercise within a local congregation. Now there's another there's a third term that's not explicitly given in our passage, but it is implicitly but first, if you turned over Ephesians, the fourth chapter in verse 11. There Paul uses the term effect is the only time that Paul uses the term in this way. He says they're in visions, the fourth chapter, he's speaking about the gifts that Christ gave to the church, when He ascended back to heaven. And his gifts were for the benefit of the church for the further growth of the church. And he identifies the gifts that are verse 11, he says, And he gave the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, the shepherds, and the teachers. The term Shepherd there comes from the Greek word, Point Main. And I believe he's referring to the elders, King James translates this term as pastor. That word is is is good, at least in the sense that it kind of has this this pasture feeling to it, it kind of suggests that there's a flock involved somewhere. But again, since that term has been kind of CO opted by others to mean things different than what the New Testament means it's probably best not to really use that term either. And so the use but the term Shepherd, though, is to be preferred. And it's useful for several reasons. But before we get to that, just notice the way that this passage is punctuated. And notice the use of the article, the he's given a list here, the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, the shepherds and teachers. Notice he does not repeat the article. And I'm told by those who know the language that suggests that both shepherds and teachers are considered as one in this passage. Shepherds are teachers. And that's the best important point that this passage is trying to drive home. The shepherds are teachers in part of the responsibility of teaching is that they should or shepherding is that they should teach the flock.

Curtis Byers  17:40
We go back to verse two in our chapter in verse x 20 and verse 28. The passage we're just looking at a moment ago, you'll see that this is although the term Shepherd is not used, the role of a shepherd is clearly implied because in verse 28, the passage says, pay careful attention to yourself, and to all the flock, to which the voice God has made you overseers. Now, the English Standard says to care for the church, as we noted a moment ago, but the King James Version is actually to be preferred here. It translates more literally the term to feed the church of God. shepherds take care of the flock by feeding the flock. feeding the flock is something they take care of by teaching. So I think this passage long with Ephesians four passions, highlights the fact that elders are to teach. The primary responsibility they have within the Lord's body of people is to be teachers of God's Word. And if you think about if you consider the qualifications that are given over First Timothy, the third chapter, most of those qualifications we might recall, are moral character type qualifications, you have to be a good person. The only qualification that really is not that sort is the qualification that they be apt to teach, according to the King James Version are able to teach. A teaching is undoubtedly one of the most important responsibilities that an elder has. So we have these terms. Excuse me one more thing, instead of this passage, we go to verse 29. The passage goes on to say that I know that after my departure fierce rules will come in among sparing the flock. So in addition to teaching, there's also the idea of protecting those within the flock from elsewhere, which are without, but even in this aspect, I believe the focus is still upon teaching because false teaching can only be countered by true teaching. So we have these, these three terms that are used, and it's interesting. I think that if we go to First Peter, the fifth chapter, we find the same three terms using given by Peter, not just Paul. So they're First Peter, the fifth chapter, verse one, Peter rice. So I exhort the elders who are among you, as a fellow elder and a witness of the sufferings of Christ, as well and partake in the glory that is going to be revealed, Shepherd, the flock of God that has among you, exercising, oversight, not under compulsion, but willingly as God would have you. So we have these three terms, elder, overseer, and shepherd, which describe the work of an elder, and the type of role that he has to play in God's peak God's kingdom. And I've heard of these terms, and I've heard this exposition much better than when I've given my entire life. But there's another term, there's a fourth term as using really the reason for this lesson. And Titus, the first chapter in verse seven, there, when Paul begins to give the qualifications for an elder, he says this, For an overseer, as God's steward, must be above reproach, and then he gives the other qualifications. You know, I've never really have thought in terms of the elder being a steward of gods. In fact, I've, I searched the My Library, the books that have to do with eldership, and kind of RAM ish through those runs through those ramming them to if you want to. And it didn't really find any discussion about this, this voted, this verse will be quoted, but it never was used as a basis of reflection. And as I reflected upon it, I continue to think there's a lot to be said a lot to greater understanding can be achieved by thinking of an elder as a steward of God's people.

Curtis Byers  22:00
And as a word as a word that they would have naturally understood, maybe more so than we would, because stewards were everywhere, in the first century, Roman world. Now, not all households has sewers, and small household might not have a steward. In those cases, it was the wife, the woman of the house, who ran the affairs of the house. There was never any record of her being called a steward. But any larger household would have would have had a steward a man who had the responsibility for running the house and the affairs of the house. In nearly every instance, that steward would have been a slave. Now, in that day in time, that's not that surprising because slaves had very important positions. In the Roman world. 1/3 of the population probably were slaves. They were doctors, they were lawyers, they were city administrators. They were they had great responsibilities placed upon them, and they were given great respect for the work that they did. You might recall over Romans 16 Verse 23, when Paul was sending greetings, on behalf of Erasmus, a Rasta Rastas were told was the city treasurer. That were treasurer is the same word for steward. He was the city steward. And undoubtedly and most likely, Erasmus would have been a slave as well. Where are they going either same stewards is that people didn't didn't apply to be a steward. There wasn't a you know, some application form you filled out stewards were chosen. In fact, they were even compelled to take on the role of steward and says most stewards were slaves, they had no no choice, but to take on the role that was assigned to them.

Curtis Byers  24:03
Excuse me. Stewards had complete authority within their household. They acted in the place of the owner. In fact, showing disrespect to a steward was one of the same thing as showing disrespect to the owner. The first and foremost, the steward had to act in the best interest of the owner. After all, it wasn't his possessions over which he was overseen. It was the it was the possessions of his owner. And there was always a day of reckoning, when a steward must give an account. The parable of talents that Jeremy spoke to us about a week or two ago, highlights the fact that there is a day when the motor comes to the steward and ask for reckoning. And in First Corinthians, the fourth chapter in verse two, Paul, speaking of his own stewardship as an apostle of Jesus Christ says moral Over is required as stewards that they be found faithful that is the desire of every steward upon that day of reckoning to be found faithful. So what can we learn about the work of an elder from them being called stewards? Well, before we can answer that we need to be probably clear as to exactly what are they stewards over. Now in that, First Corinthians four verse one a verse mediately, prior. Paul, speaking of his stewardship says that he and the other apostles, Apollo's to such like we're stewards of the mysteries of God, we still have spoken of how important it was that elders be teachers and teachers of the word. And so it could be, it could be that what Paul means there, and Titus one when he says, elders are God's stewards, it can be that there are stewards of the word that they are to teach the word faithfully. They are to convey it without bias or prejudice they are to teach it fully, and to forcefully proclaim God's will. That could be the meaning of it. There's another passage I read your attention to over Hebrews, the 13th chapter in verse 17. The text says, Obey your leaders, and I believe the leaders, our elders are some dispute that but obey your leaders and submit to them, for they are keeping watch over your souls, as those who will have to give an account, let them do this with joy and I was groaning for that would be of no advantage to you. It could be that when the elders are spoken of as stewards, it could be that what Paul has reference to has in mind is what the Hebrew writer has in mind when he talks about those who've given account. And that is that the elders are having watch over the souls of those with whom they have been entrusted. That is a terrifying thought. So humbling thought, you know, when when the writer says that there ought not being author ought not be meaning teachers, knowing that you're going to be held account for your teaching. In one is I guess what could correlate that to say there might not be milling many elders or for fearfulness of the responsibility which you they have been entrusted as well. But there is a there is a job that needs to be done. And there is a job that must be done as a job that the Lord wants to be done. There's one more thing I think this idea of steward helps bring clear perhaps, and the other words, to use to describe elders. Over First Peter, the fifth chapter, beginning of verse one, I want to read this entire section. It says, though, I exhort the elders among you, as a fellow elder to witness the sufferings of Christ, and as a protector in the glory, there's going to be revealed shepherd the flock, there's among you, exercising oversight, not under compulsion, but willingly. You know, that idea of compulsion took on a different meaning to me when I understand that stewards in general were compelled. The slaves were compelled to be stewards, they had no choice. But Peter doesn't want not want elders to feel that same sort of compulsion. Rather, they he wants them to do it willingly, as God would have you not for shameful gain, but eagerly, not domineering over those in your charge, but being examples to the flock. And when the chief Shepherd appears, he will you will be received the unfading you will receive your unfailing crown of glory. You know, stewards need to understand and would understand that

Curtis Byers  29:05
the things over which they are watching are not theirs. And if they are have if there are other slaves over whom they have responsibility, it is their job to see that the other servants Serve the Master. And how can they do that if as a servant in the household, they also don't serve the Master? How can one be a steward to owner, faithful steward to an owner without without exhibiting those qualities and those characteristics for the other members of the household? They set the standard. They become the standard and in terms of the responsibility and the care that should be taken over the Masters business. So I think this term steward is helpful. One day We ought to reflect upon maybe when we're thinking about a work of an elder, it gives us a little bit broader meaning of the term and the role that they play. And also it kind of think it helps with the god, this whole idea of, you know, God deals with elders rule. We balk at that term rule. And I'd think we've should at times balk at that, because again, notice, a steward is not the one who sets the rules, the rules have been set by the master, the steward is simply carrying out the rules, carrying out the duties, the responsibilities that the mastery, elders do not have any authority to create new rules, they have the authority to, to see that the rules of God are being exercised in the church or with their members. I say, you know, a lot of this, I'm sure has been familiar to you. And hopefully, though, is refreshing, is always beneficial. I think it's helpful as an elder in to reflect from time to time upon the work of an elder, I think it's good for our congregation to reflect upon the role of elders in terms of their expectations of the men that serve them as elders. But also, most pointedly would want to make the observation that we have many young men in this congregation, we have many men of all ages. And I'm particularly thinking of the young man. At this time. The church of the Lord has always needed elders in the church, the Lord will always continue to need elders. And elders are not made overnight. The character that's required of an elder is something that takes a lifetime to develop. And ever, as a young man, that should be of importance to you now, as you consider the future, and what roles that you might can play in the kingdom of God. And I will also highlight the fact that, as I have already tried to highlight that a primary responsibility of an elder is to teach, but you cannot teach that which you do not know. And you cannot know, unless you give diligence, to studying the Word of God. I hear good things from you are young men. And I see good many good things about the time and effort you spend with their families. And I think you're, you're careful not to spend your time at work unnecessarily, because you see us understand the importance of spending your time with your children. But let me suggest that you have another family, besides your immediate family is this family. And this family needs elders as well. Maybe the day and certainly in the future, you know, so I would encourage you give time to study, give time to prayer, give time to preparing yourself, because the day will come. When the church the Lord will be looking around for elders, and they need to be found. This lesson has been kind of a ad for elders, to draw people to want to do that work those who are young men. So it's not really been designed to convert someone who's not a Christian. But we want to give the opportunity at this time as we do every time. If there's someone here this morning, who needs to become a Christian, who knows what they need to do to be one and two, in the responsibilities and obligations of being a Christian, we would encourage you to do that today. There's no better time than now to do that which we know that ought to be done. Or if there's someone who in some other way needs to

Curtis Byers  34:03
repair to remove some other flaws, and you want to help other brothers and sisters of this congregation, we'd be more than glad to help you. If there's any way that we can assist you at this time. We would encourage you to do that as we stand
