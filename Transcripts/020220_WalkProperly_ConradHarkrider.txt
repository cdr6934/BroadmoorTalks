What a blessing it is to be able to come together on a beautiful Sunday morning and worship the Lord together. I want to invite you to open up your Bibles to Romans, the 13th chapter. Romans 13, we're going to spend the rest of our time looking at a passage from this great letter that Paul wrote to the church in Rome.

Conrad Harkrider  00:37
A couple of years ago, our oldest daughter started preschool. And one of the things that they taught them early on, one of the first things that they had to learn was how to walk in the hallways. And that's important lesson for little kids to understand. Because when you're trying to get from place to place, you can't be grabbing things off of the walls, or touching the people that are next to you or making lots of noise. And so the technique that they taught them was this duck tails, and a bubble in your mouth. Now, when she told me about that, I had absolutely no idea what she was referring to, when I was a kid, it was just keep your mouth closed. But DuckTales are holding your hands behind you, like little tails, or like handcuffs. And a bubble in your mouth is putting air in your cheeks like this, because you can't talk and have a bubble in your mouth at the same time. And so that's how they go from class to class, I have to tell you, it's very effective, we might look into implementing something similar here after our services. But it's important for them to learn how to walk. In the book of Romans, Paul uses a number of images, analogies, illustrations to make his point about the gospel. And one of those images that he uses is this idea of walking. In Romans chapter four, he says that we are to walk in the footsteps of faith, like our father, Abraham. In Romans chapter eight, he says we are to no longer walk according to the flesh. But instead according to the Spirit. In Romans chapter 14, he says that we are to walk in love in how we interact with our brothers and sisters. And in here in Romans chapter 13, he's going to talk about another type of walk, which I think really sums up all of these different ideas, when he tells them that they are to walk properly. Now walking is not referring to putting one foot in front of the other. This is not literal walking, but rather, how a person conducts themselves, how they live their lives, how they are to respond, and go about their life in this world. So let's think for a few moments about walking properly, the Christian life, that's what it's about. And what does that look like? What are the implications for us? Read with me in Romans chapter 14, beginning in verse 11, excuse me, Romans 13 In verse 11, it says, And do this, knowing the time that now it is high time to awake out of sleep. For now our salvation is near than when we first believed, the night is far spent. The day is at hand. Therefore, let us cast off the works of darkness and let us put on the armor of light. Let us walk properly, as in the day, not in revelry and drunkenness, not in lewdness and lust not in strife and envy, but put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh to fulfill its lust. In the first 11 chapters of Romans, Paul is presenting his doctrine, his teaching about the gospel. And he lays this out in in great detail. Trying to help people understand what the gospel is and what it's supposed to do. It's supposed to deliver safe people from their sins. But in chapters 12 through 15 of Paul's letter,

Conrad Harkrider  04:49
there is a shift there's this transition, and he moves away from the the teaching or the doctrine about the gospel on to the application. What is this gospel message mean? It's more than just accepting that Jesus is the Christ. How does this change our lives the way that we walk in this world. In the section that we just read, the first thing to notice is that Paul uses a ton of imagery. He talks about things like sleeping, and night, he refers to darkness. And to waking up, he speaks about the armor, and he uses analogies, like put like dressing of putting off and putting something else on. And these images help us to understand what he's trying to convey. First of all, notice that in order to walk properly, we must be watchful, and alert. Notice what he says in verse 11. He says, knowing the time that now it is high time to awake out of sleep, for salvation is near now, for salvation is near than when we first believed. He says in verse 11, that you know, the time you understand the situation that it is time to wake up, it's not time for sleep. In the Bible, sleep is often used to refer to death. But in this instance, he's not talking about dying or being dead or taking literal rest. But instead, he's telling them that they need to awake out of this spiritual drowsiness. He's calling them to, to be aware, to open their eyes, to see what's in front of them, no longer living in a sit in a state of sin and darkness. But he says, you understand you are aware of the time you have received the truth about God, and you're not in in the dark, you understand what's in front of you. And that's one of the benefits of receiving the truth of God's word is that we're no longer in darkness. We have understanding and wisdom about what this world is all about, about what is up ahead of us what is coming. And that knowledge changes us when we realize that the Lord is one day going to return. being alert was something that Jesus often emphasized in his teaching. He told several parables about the necessity of being prepared, of being watchful, of being ready. In Matthew chapter 25. He tells a parable about the 10 Virgins that are waiting for the bridegroom to come. And he speaks of five wise virgins who were able to go into the feast because they had taken extra oil they had made preparation. But on the other hand, the five foolish versions are shut outside the door because they were not ready for the feast. Being ready and watchful is critical. Because we don't know when the Lord will return. We don't know when the Lord will return or when our life is going to come to an end. Last Sunday, the world was shocked to hear the news of the tragic death of Kobe Bryant and his wife or his daughter, and seven others in the helicopter accident. It's interesting when something like that impacts our culture in our society, and even us, because we know that death is a part of this world. We understand that it's a part of life, but when it impacts someone, so suddenly, without any warning, and it happens to a person who is so well known and so young. It takes the breath out of us. It's like a cold douse of water. It's a sobering reminder that life is precious, that life is short. And it can be ended in a moment's time.

Conrad Harkrider  09:11
And so when Paul talks about knowing the time and awaking out of sleep, part of that is to realize what a blessing we have. That life is a gift from God and not to take it for granted, to make the most of the opportunities that we've been given. Because we don't know how much time we have. We don't know when we're going to leave this earth. And so the warning is to put first things first, to make sure that our priorities are in order. Jesus said that if a man gains the entire world and loses his soul, what profit is it to him? What does he have for himself if he loses his own soul? Paul says that salvation is near to us now. than when we first believed. Stop and think about that for just a moment. Our salvation is closer now than the day that we accepted than the day that we first professed faith in Christ. And Acts chapter 17 In verse 31, when Paul is giving his defense at the very obligates on Maurice Hill, and he's talking to the Athenians, and he tells them that God has set a day, he has fixed a day in which he is going to judge the world. And so if that day is set, if it's fixed, that every night that we go to bed, and we wake up the next day, we are one day closer, we're one day closer to that time, when we are going to stand in judgment before the Lord. We are closer now. This is an amazing thought that our salvation our redemption is, is near of all the things that we might anticipate in our lives, graduating from school, getting married, having that new promotion, building, that new house, all these things that we might look forward to. Paul reminds the Christians here to set their minds on the greatest blessing that we have to look forward to. And that is our salvation. Our salvation is near to us now than when we first believed. This is the hope that we hold on to we are closer to realizing this blessing. This is meant to be an encouragement to keep going to not give up to not lose hearts. If you know that the race that the finish line is almost here, and you are so close, then the admonish and encouragement is to just press on, to not lose heart. But it's also a warning, and that is to say that the time is approaching. So don't ignore it. Be watchful, and alert that's part of the Christian walk is to look around us and to be aware of the time. Also notice verse 12. In verse 12, he says that the night is far spent, the day is at hand. Therefore let us cast off the works of darkness and let us put on the armor of light. If we are to walk properly in this world, we must also cast off the works of darkness. Being a Christian and walking properly, is more than just believing doctrine. Paul spends a lot of time in the first part of the book, laying out the essential beliefs that Christians must hold. And he wants them to understand those things. But being a child of God is not just the things that we believe and know in our minds, but it has to penetrate down into our hearts and change our behavior. It changes how we live, it has to go deeper than just a thought. In Romans chapter six and verse 13.

Conrad Harkrider  13:11
He says, do not present your members to sin as instruments for unrighteousness. But present yourself to God as those who have been brought from death to life, and your members to God as instruments for righteousness. When we come to Christ, there is this total transformation that happens. And the way that he describes it here, it's like a person who was dead, who was buried in the ground, and now they have come and they have been restored to life. It's a complete 180. And in practical terms, what that looks like is that we are to no longer be using our bodies, our members as instruments of unrighteousness as fulfilling our desires, but instead focused on doing what pleases the Lord. And in order to do that Romans 13 says we have to cast off, we have to put off the works of darkness. Remember that he's using this imagery here. Darkness. And that is helpful. When he compares these things with darkness because he is describing them he is depicting them for what they really are. He's pulling back the curtain to show their true nature. In Ephesians chapter five and verse 11. Paul says take no part in the unfruitful works of darkness but instead expose them. Notice how he describes these things. He says they are unfruitful. He says they are works of darkness. Not to be tolerated or ignored, but rather to expose them. You know, we have a tendency to gloss over sin. It's easy for us to, to minimize it, to disregard it to justify we say things like, Well, it's, it's not a big deal. I might say something that's not true, but it's not affecting anyone or doesn't really have that much of an impact. But did you notice how Paul refers to these things? He calls them darkness. When sin is concealed, when it's covered up, when it's justified or ignored, the problem doesn't just go away, but rather it grows stronger and stronger. And that's why he says here, it needs to be exposed. It needs to be brought out into the open think about David and Bathsheba. What started out as lust, one night on top of the palace, ultimately led to adultery. That adultery then caused David to bring one of his soldiers in and make him get drunk. And then he developed this whole conspiracy and ultimately participated in having Uriah murdered. Sin has a tendency to build it sinks its roots deeper and deeper. It gets harder and harder to remove from our hearts. Unless it's exposed unless it's brought out into the open. When we identify it, when we call it what it really is. That's the first step in removing it from our lives to say this is darkness. This is evil. It's wrong. In verse 13. He lists some of these sins, he says, were to walk properly, not in revelry and drunkenness, not in lewdness and lust not in strife and envy. The first four things that he mentions there have to do with excess. They are unrestrained indulgence. He says carousing and revelry on any uninhibited, unrestrained drunkenness and debauchery. He's talking about things where a person is just fully giving themselves over to sin. And that's what the world is selling us. The world is saying if it feels good, do it. If it's something that you want, then take it. Just giving yourselves in to whatever your desires may be, as the writer in Proverbs said, it's like an ox who goes to the slaughter just fully following these things.

Conrad Harkrider  18:03
Sexual immorality, and sensuality, unrestricted out of control, the passage that we read, to begin our worship, from the book of Exodus talking about the children of Israel, what was going on there, they put together all their gold, they build this golden calf. And when Moses and Joshua come back down into the camp, it's not the shout of war or the shout of victory or defeat that they hear but it's this sound of singing and just giving themselves over to pleasure, unbridled, unrestricted and giving themselves over to this desire. These are the things of the world. It's interesting that he doesn't just touch on the big sins. He talks about drunkenness and sexual immorality, and lust. But then he also mentions strife and jealousy, contention. bickering and fighting, creating some type of wedge or issue between two people, by the things that we say, either to a person or about another person, creating jealousy and envy within our hearts. We look at another person we see the things that they have or the position that we hold and we envy that person. Paul says that's not just having a bad attitude that is one of the works of darkness. This past summer, we were staying at a friend's house. And one afternoon we decided to use the grill and so my friend was out there taking off of taking off the cover. And underneath the grill. He found a black widow. I've never seen one of those in, in person before. But he said they're pretty common around their house. He said that part of the they live out in the country and they find them frequently. Sometimes they'll even find them in a boot or a shoe that's been left in in the hallway or one of the closets. And so for the rest of our trip, every time I went to put my shoes on, it took about five extra minutes because I was shaking those things out checking meticulously making sure that there wasn't some type of poisonous spider that was going to get on my foot. I want you to imagine if one of those things crawled up onto your hand, or crawled up onto your arm, what would be your reaction? Would you would you turn away from it? Would you just ignore the fact that it's there would you softly nudge it away? Our response would be to swat it, to throw it to flick it off, to cast it away as far as possible to run out of the room. Because we understand how dangerous it is. Sin is not something that we that we should tolerate that we should be okay with having in our lives, we have to see it for what it is. It's poison. It's danger, it harms us. And Paul says to walk properly, we must cast it for from us. Also notice what he says in verse 14. In verse 14, he says, to put on the Lord Jesus Christ and make no provision for the flesh, to fulfill its lust and walking properly, we must make no provision for sin. What does it mean to make provision for something? It is to provide or supply the needs. When you make provision you are planning, there's four thoughts. There's four sight involved. If you make provisions to have people into your home for a meal, you have to go and buy the food, you have to clean the house, you have to set out the chairs and prepare the table, you get everything ready.

Conrad Harkrider  22:34
And so how often do we create and set up an environment that is perfect for sin to come in and take hold. Instead of fleeing from temptation, we invite it into our hearts. We click on the link, we look at the picture, they will have no business in pulling up. Or we surround ourselves with people we put ourselves in a situation that makes it very difficult, very challenging to do the right thing. We get into a conversation and we introduce a subject that stirs up that strife that incites that jealousy. We drop a little bit of information that causes someone to feel that resentment. We are making provisions for sin. It's like taking fuel and adding it to the fire Paul says we have to cut those things off. If we're honest with ourselves will realize that sin often creeps through a door that is intentionally left open. It's coming through the back because we haven't closed it off. We haven't shut it out of our lives. We need to be honest with ourselves, why am I looking at this? Why am I going here? Why am I spending time with these people? Instead of heading down a street where sin lives hoping that it doesn't invite us to come inside we need to avoid it altogether to choose a different path and direction. Sometimes we kid ourselves and we think well I'm just gonna watch a little bit. You know, I just want to see what it's about. Everybody is talking about this show. It's very popular. And and I just want to see the general idea or theme. And we fool ourselves and begin to head down a path that's difficult to get off. In Psalm 101. In verse two, David said, I will ponder the way that is blameless. Oh, when will you come to me I will walk with integrity of heart within my house. I will not set before my eyes anything that is worthless. I hate the work of those who fell who fall away. It shall not clean to me a person Verse heart shall be far from me, I will know nothing of evil. Do you see the resolve, and the absolute terms that David is speaking with? He says that he's going to walk with integrity, he's not going to set anything evil, before his eyes. He says that he hates these things. And in verse four, I will know nothing of evil. If we are going to overcome sin, we have to have a certain amount of determination and resolve. We have to believe that is possible to remove sin from our lives. We have to trust that when God said that he's not going to allow us to be tempted beyond what we are able, but that he can provide an escape for us that He is faithful and true to His promises. And once we believe that the Lord can deliver us, then we've got to as David did set our hearts to ponder the way that is blameless. And to not set before our eyes anything that is worthless to have this absolute resolve and determination. One of the things that was so impressive about Kobe Bryant's NBA career,

Conrad Harkrider  26:29
if you've read about his time, as a pro, was his absolute commitment to being the very best. It wasn't something that happened by accident, or just by chance, or because he was so talented. You read about him spending long hours of practice, training himself working diligently, so that when he was put into the test, when he was faced with the opposition, he would be successful. And I think for Christians, we have to have a similar type of mentality of commitment and intensity not to winning basketball championships, but to being faithful to the Lord, in our service to God. And so that means that no matter how difficult it may be, are we putting in the time are we putting in the hours? Are we putting in the sweat? And and the effort and the energy and the attention? Are we making the sacrifices if it means changing jobs, or removing a relationship from our lives, or getting rid of a cell phone or whatever it may be? Are we willing to put in the effort and make no provision for the flesh. Finally, in walking properly, it's not just about avoiding things that are bad, but in this text, he talks about what we need to put on what we need to clothe ourselves with. Notice verse 14, he says, Put on the Lord Jesus Christ. He also talks about in verse 12, he says, let us put on the armor of light and walking properly, we need to put on the Lord Jesus Christ. We must dress ourselves in righteousness, the armor of light, verse 12, that's our protection. That's our, our defense against evil. In Ephesians, chapter six, Paul describes the armor of God. He says, the belt of truth, the breastplate of righteousness, the shield of faith, the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God. And why is it that we need this armor? Why does Paul use that imagery? It's because we are involved in a battle, we are faced with an attack that is going on. There are forces of evil around us and Satan is constantly looking for ways to find a gap in the armor to see a place where we are susceptible. Putting on the Lord Jesus means being proactive. It's preparing ourselves. When armies used to come and attack a city before they began their attack, what they would often do is they would look for a place that would be easier to breach the wall someplace that was lower or that was compromised. And they were trying to start there to begin their attack and Satan is doing the same thing. He's trying to find ways to drag us down to trap us an area of vulnerability or weakness. But putting on the Lord means that we when we see those things, we we add reinforcements. We ask for help we look for guidance, we seek Godly counsel. It means that we're reading and studying and praying and meditating God's word, spending time with people who are moving in the same direction, trying to seek and follow God, and not people who are going to bring us down who are tearing down, or making it more difficult for us, to serve Him. When we fill our hearts up with these good things, when we put on the Lord, it leaves little room or space for evil and sin, to come in. Putting on the Lord means that we imitate him. It means that we have the same desires that we have the same commitment as him. We want the same things that Jesus came to this earth to accomplish. And so when people look at our lives, when they describe us, would they use the same adjectives that were used to describe Christ? Do people see us as someone who has put on the character of Jesus, a person who is compassionate? Someone who is willing to make sacrifices for the good or benefit of other people, someone who is interested in those who don't know about God,

Conrad Harkrider  31:11
someone who shows kindness, and love someone who is humble, who's not interested in elevating themselves, but rather that God would be glorified. You see, being a Christian is not just about going to church or being around a certain group of people. It's about walking and living away. That's different. And we are seeking to follow in the footsteps of the only person that has ever lived on this earth. As a sinless man, we are seeking to imitate Jesus Christ. In First Peter chapter two and verse 21, it says, For to this you have been called because Christ also suffered for you leaving you an example, so that you might follow in his steps. Are we walking properly in this world, God help us to remove those things, to cast off the works of darkness. And not just to remove but then to clothe ourselves to put on the Lord Jesus Christ. If there's something that we can do to encourage you, or to help you, in your walk with Christ this morning, we're gonna leave this as an opportunity for you to respond to the gospel. If we need to pray for you, or if you are if you need to submit yourself to Christ this morning by putting on the Lord, in baptism, whatever it may be, you can use this opportunity now as together we stand and sing
