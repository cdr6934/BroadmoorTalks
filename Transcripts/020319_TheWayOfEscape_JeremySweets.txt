Good evening. It's good to see everyone tonight, and certainly good that we could gather together and worship our God, I appreciate the fact that you're here. You may be well aware of the fact that you have other options tonight, but you've made the good choice and being here to worship God. And I appreciate the fact that you are here. And I've not been in a lot of situations that I would consider truly hopeless, not been in a situation where I felt completely trapped, at least I was racking my brain trying to think of one. So the best I could come up with as I thought about that concept was Aladdin, Disney's Aladdin. I don't know if you remember Aladdin, but he gets trapped in the Cave of Wonders when he goes down into the cave, and it kind of closes up over top of him, and there's no way out. There's no way that he can get out of that situation. There's no way of escape. And ultimately, he finds the Aladdin right, and he gets on the carpet and ultimately through those means there's a way of escape. But before that, there is no way to get out. There is nothing that you see there. I thought about also talking about national treasure at the end where they go down at the bottom, but I'll not do that.

Jeremy Sweets  01:20
The way of escape, if you are in a situation where there is a hopeless situation where it feels like you are trapped, it would certainly be a relief to find the way of escape. In first Corinthians chapter 10. Paul talks about the fact that sin can be that way. It can feel as if you are trapped, and you're in a hopeless situation, and there's no way out. But Paul reminds us in First Corinthians chapter 10, and verse 13, that there is the way of escape. And that way of escape has been provided to us by God, himself. So I'd like to talk for just a few moments tonight about the way of escape. Before we get down to verse 13. Or talks about the fact that there is a way of escape from sin. Let me frame really how we got to verse 13. In the text, we're going to do that by looking at at Paul's instruction on meat sacrifice to idols, we're going to really see the discussion is found in Chapter eight through 10. And 10 is kind of the end of that discussion. So we'll talk about what Paul has to say regarding meat sacrifice to idols. In first Corinthians chapter eight and verse one. In the book of Corinth, it seems, Corinthians It seems like Paul is responding to inquiries from the Corinthians. And so sometimes they'll say Now concerning this, or that subject, and he does that in chapter eight and verse one, he says, Now concerning food offered to idols, we know that all possessed knowledge, this knowledge puffs up but love builds up. If anyone imagines that he knows something he does not yet know as he ought to know. But if anyone loves God, he is known by God. There seems to be a question at Corinth about whether one could eat meat sacrificed to idols. Now this seems to be the common practice in the the city of Corinth, that they would offer their meat and sacrifice to the polytheistic gods that were there. And so the question comes up whether people could go and partake of this, is this something that they should do. And I'm sure that some of the Christians there were arguing, saying that we know that these gods are false. They're not real, there is nothing to this meat sacrifice to this false idol. And so I can carry on in this activity. But Paul wants to remind them of a few things in regards to that matter. And the first thing he wants to remind them of is in chapter eight that they need to be concerned for the week. Yes, you may have knowledge about the meat sacrificed to idols and the fact that the idols really are nothing. But there are those that may be torn about that there are those that are new in the faith, that may be troubled about that matter. And so he says you need to be concerned for the week. In verses eight and nine, he says, food will not commend us to God, we are no worse off if we do not eat and no better off if we do, but take care that this rite of yours does not somehow become a stumbling block to the week. So you're not the only one and your knowledge is not the only thing to be considered. You must also consider others and so he says in chapter eight be concerned for the week. He says in chat After nine that you need to really follow my example, Paul had displayed a lifetime of giving up his rights in order to serve others. And Paul says, As a Christian, that's what you need to do, you may have the right to eat meat. But if that's the cause of brother to stumble, then give that write up, it would be much better to preserve what is good for your brother, than to avail yourself of your right. And so he says, give up your rights. In chapter 10, he's going to change the discussion a little bit. And that's where we're gonna get down to verse 13, which is our text for tonight. But he's gonna say not only be concerned for other people, but he says, you also need to be concerned about your own self, you need to be concerned about what will happen to you. It may be that if you participate in going to these places where meat is sacrificed to idols, even though they're not true, if you associate with these types of things, you may be led into sin. If you take idolatry and sin lightly, you may fall. And Paul is going to make that point in chapter 10. So let's look a little further into the details of chapter 10. Notice in the first four verses, the first four verses of First Corinthians 10. Here it says, For I do not want you to be unaware of brothers, that our fathers were all under the cloud, and all passed through the sea. And all were baptized into Moses in the cloud and in the sea, and all ate the same spiritual food and all drank the same spiritual drink, for they drank from the spiritual rock that followed them, and the rock was Christ. Notice a few things about this introduction, as he talks to these Corinthians, Corinthians were Greeks, by and large, and I have to assume that the makeup of the congregation was largely Greek, but he says, Remember our fathers. It's not a national here, father of the Israelites, but as Christians, that was now their heritage, not just a national heritage, but a spiritual heritage. And so he points these Gentile Christians to their fathers, the Jews, the Israelites. And he goes on to say, and point out and three or four different ways, the blessings that the Israelites experienced. And he says that they all experienced that you might notice that as we read through those sentences there, he uses the word all three or four times, what did they all do? Well, they were all under the cloud and pass through the sea. And all were baptized and Moses in the cloud, and in the sea, your may remember that they crossed over the Red Sea is the the waters parted, they pass through that, you may remember that they were led by the day by the cloud, and at night by the pillar of fire. And so we see that through that passing through, in a sense, they were baptized. Now, baptism simply means an immersion. And so they were those that had water all around them. And the cloud on top, you may understand as being a sense of water. And so they were baptized into Moses when they crossed over the Red Sea and left behind Egypt. That was when they were becoming the people of God as they went to Mount Sinai. And he says that they were baptized, in a sense, now this would have had a clear connection to Christians wouldn't. They were baptized to become the people of God. He goes on to talk about their time in the wilderness when he says in verse three, that they all ate the same spiritual food, what spiritual food that they have, well, food from heaven, quite literally, manna came down from heaven, and the Israelites all partake of that food. They were also given drink by God himself in a miraculous fashion. When they cried out for thirst, God provided them water and so they drink, a spiritual drink. This would have had a clear connotation for Christians at that time, who were not only baptized into Christ, become the people of God, but for took a spiritual food and drink the Lord's Supper. They enjoyed those blessings. He goes on to say in verse four, for they drank from the spiritual rock that followed them and that rock was Christ. There is reference to God himself being a rock for the people in the Old Testament as they went through the wilderness. And I'm not exactly sure what specific references has, but you can see that he says that they had the rock. God was with them. Rice was their rock that followed. And so the analogy is you think about the Israelites, they had all of these blessings, and they experienced all of these blessings. And so we would step back from that and think they were accepted by God. But verse five says, Nevertheless, with most of them, God was not pleased, for they were overthrown. In the wilderness. All of them enjoy the spiritual blessings of baptism, all of them ate of spiritual food and drink of spiritual drink, all of them had the rock which is Christ, but God was not pleased with them because of the because of their disobedience. And so Paul is beginning to point to the fact that, yes, you may be a Christian, and you may have a tremendous amount of blessings. But that doesn't make you immune from sin. That doesn't give you an automatic approval by God.

Jeremy Sweets  11:02
But rather, you must pay attention to dangers that are present, Paul is going to use for illustrations to really make this point. And we're going to see that he frames that in verses six and 11. By saying now, these things took place as examples for us. And he says that again in verse 11, now these things happen to them as an example. Now, I know that Kevin Bane has been talking to us about Christ in the Old Testament, and one of the things he's talked to us about is types and Anna types. Christ is a type of what we find are there are types of Christ in the Old Testament, Christ being the enter time. And that simply means that there is a model or there is a a picture, prefigured there have Christ of who he is. Well, it's interesting, as you look at verses six and 11, this word example is that word type. So he says, Now these things took place as types, these things are examples, these things are a pattern of what happened to them, and this could happen to you. Now, I think we can look at this and apply this very generally to our lives to see how sin can affect us. But keep in mind that Paul was specifically talking about the question of meat sacrificed to idols, and the danger that that could present for the people. And so it's interesting the examples that he uses to say, you can look just like these people in the Old Testament, verse seven, do not be idolaters, as some of them were, as it is written, The people sat down to eat and drink, and rose up to play. In Exodus chapter 32, and verse six, there's a quotation that we find there that they rose up to eat and play that took place right after they had built the golden calf. And they had really worshiped there. And the text says that after they did that, they sat down to eat, and drink, and rose up to play the word play. There's not, I don't think idea of like a hopscotch, but it's more of a revelry that took place. So notice the connection that Paul was is making here, says, Be careful about going to places where meat is sacrificed to idols, notice the connection of idolatry, eating, drinking, and then he says, and then revelry takes place. And so you need to be careful of that because notice what happened to them. There was the idolatry, the eating the drinking, and that led to revelry. And so that is an association with idolatry and you must be careful about that. That's the first example. The second example is found in verse eight. We must not indulge in sexual immorality as some of them did, and 23,000 fell in a single day. We must not indulge in sexual immorality. This references Numbers chapter 25, verses one through nine where the Israelites committed in Morality with the women of Moab. And in numbers 25. In verse two, it says, These invited the people to the sacrifices of their gods, and the people ate and bow down to the gods. The Septuagint translation says that the people sat down sacrifice to their idols, and the people ate of their sacrifices, Paul's making a connection here, between the idolatry and the eating and the immorality that was often associated with idolatry. So he points out to these things, be careful. Be warned, we must not commit sexual immorality. That's his second example. Notice this third example that he gives In verse nine, he says we must not put Christ to the test, as some of them did and were destroyed by serpents. He's made the connection between idolatry and revelry and immorality. He's also going to talk about grumbling or complaining, which the people may have been doing because their rights were being violated or they were not able to engage in the rights of eating the meats, or it may simply be against Paul, because he was instructing them not to, to eat if it would cause others to stumble.

Jeremy Sweets  15:38
This references here, numbers 21, when the Israelites grumbled in the wilderness, and God sent fiery serpents as punishment to them, the text says that they did this. And they tested God in their heart by demanding the food they crave. That actually comes from Psalm 78 And verse 18, as it reflects on this story, they tested God in their heart by demanding the food that they craved. This reminds me as we go back to verse six of chapter 10. Now these things took place as examples for us that we might not desire evil as they did. This evil, this evil desire in their hearts, led them to grumbling, complaining, negativity. And so he warns them about that and tells them that they were destroyed by the serpents. The fourth example is a continuation of the Third, there, he says in verse 10, nor grumble as some of them did, and were destroyed by the destroyer. I don't know of a specific reference to the destroyer, except for what we see happen that the, for the Egyptians, the the angel of death, but we do know that there's White's complained often in the wilderness. And on one occasion we find in Numbers chapter 14, after their complaints, God punished them, saying that they would not be able to enter into the land of promise. And so they were destroyed, not necessarily by destroyer, but by God's judgment there. So notice that in the wilderness, they all experienced these blessings. They all had these spiritual blessings. But God was not pleased with most of them because of the way they acted. Because they allowed idolatry into their life. And that affected them when it came to revelry, it affected them when it came to immorality, and their attitude of grumbling. And Paul saying they are types for you, Corinthians, you need to be careful about your own life, that you do not fit the same description that we read in the Old Testament. Now, we might not be discussing meat sacrifice to idols today. But I think we need to take Paul's instruction to heart just as much just as well, we cannot take sin lightly. It's not something to be trifled with. But rather, it is dangerous, and we need to treat it in that manner. Notice that Paul has a couple of conclusions in verses 12 and 13. And then also in verse 14. And the text continues there. There's more to talk about. But we'll we'll stop there as we consider our points. But notice in verses 12 and 13, he says, Therefore, therefore let anyone who thinks that he stands take heed lest he fall. No temptation has overtaken you that is not common to man. God is faithful, and he will not let you be tempted beyond your ability. But with the temptation, he will also provide the way of escape, that you may be able to endure it. So he tells them take care how you think, how you think about sin. And then in verse 14, he says, Therefore, my beloved, flee from idolatry. We need to develop the right attitude and mindset about sin, and how we approach sin. And then we need to flee from it, get away from it take action when it comes to temptation. And yes, we're also going to look at the fact that we do have a way of escape, and that's been provided to us by God. So it helps me to see that flow of the passage to understand what Paul is talking about as we go through this as we come to verse 13. To talk about this way of escape, and talking about sin. There are a few things that we can learn about sin as we look at this passage. First of all, sin is destructive. Sin is destructive. He says No temptation has overtaken you. She's noticed that language, the words their sin is something that can overtake you hear those words I think about maybe a tidal wave that would come up and overtake a city or overtake a street or house or town. It's something that completely demolishes completely comes over top of, and often there's nothing left in its wake. Sin is destructive. Romans chapter six tells us that sin brings forth death. It is the ultimate destruction. Sin is destructive, it can overtake you. And it's also something that requires an escape. It requires an escape.

Jeremy Sweets  20:40
When you're talking about escape, you're talking about something serious. You don't say something like I escaped from that single ant the other day was single Lance, not not a threat is it? You don't say I escaped from a feather. You know, unless you have some kind of weird fear feathers are very ticklish. You don't say things like that those things aren't dangerous. But you would say something like, you know, I escaped from that hurricane. I escaped from that lion that was on the loose. I escaped from something that I almost lost my life. You say you use the word escape when you're talking about something serious. Sin is destructive. It is serious. The text also tells us that sin is common. In verse 13, No temptation has overtaken you that is not common to man. Cause sin is common in that people commit sin don't. We've all sinned, and that way it's common. But we also see that every particular sin, the types of sin that are committed, are not unique. And we do ourselves a disservice when we begin to tell ourselves that I'm the only one facing this sin. This is only happening to me, I'm the only one. Paul says that is not the case. No temptation has overtaken you that is not common demand. It is common these are these are things that happen we need to be aware of them and prepared. Sometimes we talk about dangerous things like something was a hand of God, kind of emergency in the world. And that's something that happens once in a lifetime. But Paul is talking about not something that's once in a lifetime, but something that is common. So he calls us to a state of preparedness, a state of awareness. If it was once in a lifetime, we might say well, I'll just simply wait for that or not have to pay that grade of attention to it. But Paul says no, this is common sin is common. And we need to treat it like a common threat, a regular danger. Not only that, but we also see that sin is a choice. Sin is avoidable, it can either be committed or avoided. You know, we are not robots in this situation to where we are programmed to sin and we have no choice but to sin. That's not the case. No, Paul says nope, beyond the alert. Be aware, there is a way of escape now seek that way of escape. Sin is a choice. And we need to be very much aware of that facts.

Jeremy Sweets  23:44
Not only that, but we learned some things about God as well. God is good, and God is faithful. In James one in verse 13, it says, Let no one say when he is tempted, I am being tempted by God, for God cannot be tempted by evil, and he himself tempts no one. God is not attracted to. He does not desire evil, God is good and pure. He wants what is good and pure. In the beginning, when God created all things when he stepped back and looked at his creation, the product of his will, he said, It is good. That which is good comes from a good God. Now when we think about God and His goodness, we see that he doesn't desire sin for himself. He doesn't desire sin for anyone else. He's not going to try to get you to sin either. He doesn't tempt you. He doesn't desire that you would fall. He doesn't want you to stumble. But rather, he wants you to find a way of escape. And so God is good. In our text in First Corinthians 10 Verse 13, we see that God is faithful. Now how is he faithful? Well In many, many ways, right? But in this passage, he says God is faithful and that he will not allow you to be tempted beyond your ability. But with the temptation, he will also provide the way of escape. God not only wants you to do what's right, but God is actively working for you. God provides the way of escape. God shows you there is another way. When it comes to sin, we often lie to ourselves and say that, that, you know, I have no choice in this, I had to do this, I feel like I have no control. And that's what Satan wants us to think. But God tells us that he has provided a way of escape. God is working for you. God is good, and he wants good things for you. So what should we do? As people as we address him, well, we need to develop the right perspective, the right attitude towards sin, one of the things I've noticed about sin is that we are often very, very poor evaluators. That is we tend to underestimate the danger of sin and overestimate our ability to handle it. We say things like, it's really not that big a deal. Or we say things like I can handle it, I can stop anytime I've want. Maybe you've heard that about those that are addicts, those that are alcoholics, I can control this, I'm in complete control. We do the same thing with sin, don't we? we kid ourselves light ourselves and say that we are in complete control of this. But instead what we need to do is see sin is very dangerous. Sin is very dangerous. And we need to, to evaluate our own lives and take take those threats as a serious threat. We need not minimize it. You know, it's kind of like there's a lion on the loose, but we're treating that lion like it's a little bitty house kitten. And we want to take that kitten and cuddle with it. pet it. This isn't that big a deal. That's what we think it is. But in truth, it's that roaring lion seeking to devour us. And so we need to develop the right perspective about sin, and about who we are before sin. And we need humility. We need humility. We saw from this passage in verse 12, that anyone who thinks that he stands he needs to take heed lest he fall. You've probably heard this statement pride comes before the fall. That's actually found in Proverbs chapter 16, verse 18, at least the loose translation, Pride goes before destruction and a haughty spirit before a fall. In Proverbs 18 And verse 12. It says before destruction a man's heart is haughty. But humility comes before honor. When we are arrogant, and say I can handle this, this is no problem. I'm strong enough. I'm big enough to handle this sin. I can get as close as I want. I'm in complete control.

Jeremy Sweets  28:27
That type of arrogance that type of Pride goes before the fall before the fall. So we need humility. We need humility. We also need perseverance. When we are tested with sin, it's likely not something that's going to happen once in our life. Satan is not that foolish. He's going to test us over and over again. So we need to overcome and endure sin. But we need to do that on a continual basis. So we need to be ready and prepared to persevere and spend a lifetime devoted to godliness and seeking God's will. We need perspective, humility, and perseverance. Well, there's a lot of things we can think about with this. Those are some pretty quick points. But I would like to close our lesson tonight as we think about some ways of escape. In first Corinthians chapter 10 And verse 13. It says that God is faithful. He will not let us be tempted to beyond our ability but with the temptation will provide the way of escape. There is another choice to make. There is another avenue that we can take that does not lead to sin. And God I believe has provided us many benefits, many avenues many helps. That can help us when we face temptation, and so I like to talk about a few of those tonight. First of all, flee and that's exactly what Paul says in first Corinthians 10 And verse 14, therefore, my beloved flee from idolatry. The question was, should I go and you know, I can eat the meat I can go where they're sacrificing to the idols and they're eating the meat. I know that's nothing but you know, I can go in, it's not that big a deal. Paul says flee. When it comes to anything that might lead to sin, or anything that could be dangerous, any kind of association with pure ungodliness, don't tiptoe there. Don't say this won't affect me. Don't get close to it and say it's not that big a deal, but he says, Flee, flee. This is actually a pretty common instruction in Scripture. In first Corinthians six and verse 18, there is he talks about immorality, he says, Flee from sexual immorality, and morality as a sin that is committed against the body. When he's talking about the love of money in First Timothy, chapter six, verses nine and 10, he says, But as for you, oh man of God, flee these things. Flee from these things and pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, steadfastness, gentleness, fight the good fight of the face. It's interesting as he talks about fleeing there uses the imagery of a fight. And I think that's what it is, when it comes to sin often isn't, it is a fight. And we're going to have to fight the good finds. In Second Timothy two in verse 22, he says, So Flee youthful passions and pursue righteousness, faith, love and peace, along with those who call in the name of the Lord from a pure heart, flee from sin, flee from idolatry. Flee from sexual immorality, flee from the love of money and everything associated with it, flee from sin. Get away from it. Don't flirt with it. Don't get close. Don't minimize its danger, but flee. Flee. You know, that's exactly what Joseph did. In Genesis chapter 39, Potiphar, his wife saw that Joseph was a man of handsome reform and appearance. And she said, why with me, she was not very subtle. She was very direct. Often that's how sin works. Why with me, and he refused. Attack says that she spoke to him day after day. She didn't let up after once. But she continued to to make advances toward him. Why with me, and he didn't. And so she caught him one day when they were alone by his jacket. I don't, I'm not sure what would have gone through my head. It may have been something like, you know, this is boss's wife, I'm gonna get in trouble. You know, I don't know what he was thinking. But I know what he did. He realized that sin was dangerous. And he fled. And he got out of there and he left his jacket. There, he left his cloak. Joseph fled, we need to flee from sin.

Jeremy Sweets  33:16
Well, the thing we need to do, and this is really the flip side of the coin of fleeing is cut it off. Sometimes we need to simply get out of there. Other times, we may need to remove the temptation or cut it off, get it away from ourselves. In Matthew five, verses 27 through 30. Jesus says, You have heard that it was said you shall not commit adultery. But I say to you that everyone who looks at a woman with a lustful intent has already committed adultery with her in his heart. If your right eye causes you to sin, tear it out and throw it away. For her, it's better that you lose one of your members, then your whole body be thrown into hell. And if your right eye causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. for it. It's better that you lose one of your members than your whole body go into hell. Those are very true statements, aren't they? I don't recommend cutting out your eye or cutting your handle. But I do recommend thinking in drastic terms when it comes to sin. It's not something where you need to tiptoe to solution sometimes we may need to take drastic solutions, we may have steps in order to deal with sin. It is life threatening, life threatening, and we need to treat it in that way. So we need to cut it off. Is there something in your life that you've kept around and feel like I've got to have this here this is just as part of part of my work or this is part of my job. This is part of my family life. You know, this is something here I've got to have it here. But if it's leading you to sin and then cut it out I cut it off, put it away. We also need to pray about it. God is the one that will provide the way of escape. So let us go to God Almighty in prayer about our sin. Jesus modeled prayer for his disciples. And in Matthew chapter six and verse 13. He said, as he was praying to God, lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Be careful with our steps, he calls upon God. And this was clearly for the benefit of disciples as Jesus did NOT SIN himself. But I'm also sure that he did not invite temptation is something that he wanted. And so he says, lead us not into temptation, deliver us from evil, or even the evil one, the one who tempts Matthew 26 and verse 41, as Jesus was, at the Garden of Gethsemane, He told His disciples Watch and pray that you may not enter into temptation. The spirit is indeed will willing, but the flesh is weak. There are many things that we need to be praying about. But certainly temptation is sin needs to be on our list on a regular ongoing basis. We need to be praying to God about that, that we will be able to the temptations will stay away, when they come our way we can face them, we need to be praying for purity and godliness of heart, we need to be pursuing it. Cast your requests upon God, certainly if that is one of our requests. God will help us and aid us and we need to go to him on a regular basis, pray about your sin, you can do that in general terms and also very, very specific terms. You know, when it comes to sin, we often talk in general terms. I've got this weakness. But when it comes to prayer, God knows, you know, we say face with other people sometimes, but God knows, be brutally honest with him. There's no need to save face, so to speak, God knows your heart. So talk about sin directly and openly. Talk in a way where you may not talk to anyone else in that way, but talk to God. Bring that to God pray to him about it. We also need to use scripture. This is something I see Jesus doing in Matthew chapter four, Jesus was tempted three different times before he began his ministry in earnest. And each time he was he responded with a statement it is written.

Jeremy Sweets  37:48
Well, that's, that's a great model for us. We need to use scripture. We can use scripture against sin. It may be that we struggle with lost we need to quote, job 31 verse one, I've made a covenant with my eyes, how then can I gaze at a version? It may be that we struggle with with anger, we need to quote the proverb, A gentle answer turns away wrath, or be angry and do not sin, watching our actions as it goes along with anger. It may be that we're very selfish, or we have a hard time with forgiveness, use Ephesians 430, to be kind to one another, tender hearted, forgiving one another as God in Christ has forgiven you. And we could go on and on and on. Whatever your problem is fine scripture, memorize scripture, quote, scripture, fight Satan with scripture, just as Jesus did use God's Word. We also need to remember the consequences. One of the things we tend to do when we face temptation or sin is we look at the very narrow time that that might provide some brief moment of pleasure. And we block everything else out. But we need to remember the consequences. And this could fill our minds in a far reaching way, first of all, the eternal consequences. We are committing a sin that will separate us from Almighty God, the Creator and Source of all life. Why would we do that? There's even more consequences than that there are people that look up to us, we could let them down. There are people that depend upon us we could devastate their trust and bring great pain and harm to them. Why would we do that? Fathers remind yourself of your daughters. Husbands, remind yourself of your wives, wives, remind yourself of your husband and your children. Remind yourself of your fellow Christian friends, remind yourself of your co workers who you You've been trying to talk to the gospel Val, they've been looking up to remind yourself sin has consequences. Galatians chapter six and verse seven says, Do not be deceived, God is not mocked. For whatever one sows, that will he also reap. Don't be deceived. Sin brings great and tremendous consequences remind yourself of that fact. We also need to use fellow Christians God has given us in a sense one another. And we need to use one another for strength and encouragement. And Ecclesiastes four in verse 12. It says an old man might prevail against one who is alone to will withstand him. A three fold cord is not quickly broken. Use fellow Christians for encouragement. We need to use fellow Christians and reach out to fellow Christians to help them. Proverbs 27 Verse 17, says iron sharpens iron and one man sharpens another. We need to ask our fellow Christians, our brothers and sisters in Christ about their larges about their spiritual health, ask them how they're doing, give people opportunities, to talk about things that have been bothering them. So you can talk about the game yesterday or tonight or whatever, that that's appropriate. But don't let that be the sole content of the discussion or your hobbies or things like that. With brothers and sisters in Christ, we need to be able to talk about things that affect us like sin. And so ask to be held accountable to another, I'm struggling with this. I've been angry, I use swear words, I, I you can go down the list whatever it was, talk to someone else say I want you to ask me about the sin because I don't want that to take hold. Or it may be that you ask someone else. Is there anything that I can help you with? Anything that you need to be held accountable for? I know I do. And I don't suggest approaching that in an arrogant way. You've got a long list, maybe let me help you keep accountable. Now we're seeking to help. We're seeking to help so us, fellow Christians, US fellow Christians, use those that are older and wiser. Those that have faced us our elders use the older men, the older women here, seek wisdom. Seek wisdom.

Jeremy Sweets  42:39
US fellow Christians. Not only that, but we need to look to Jesus. We've already mentioned the fact that we look to God we pray to Him. We remember that God is faithful. We treat God like our father, I certainly don't want to let my earthly father down. And I, even more than that don't want to let my heavenly father down. But we also need to look to Jesus, look to Jesus, and Hebrews chapter 12 And verse one and two. There it says Therefore, since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight and sin which clean so closely. And let us run with endurance the race to the set before us looking to Jesus, the founder and perfecter of our faith, who for the joy set before him endured the cross, despising the shame, and is seated at the right hand of the throne of God. When it comes to this Christian life. And everything that we do, we need to be looking to Jesus our perfect example. And that's also true when it comes to sin. And Hebrews two verse 18, it says For because he himself has suffered when tempted, He is able to help those who are being tempted. Look to Jesus, Jesus was tempted, He came here and faced temptations, and he overcame, we need to rely upon him for strength. Look to his example, look to what he did look to Jesus that will keep our eyes where they need to be. Instead of looking around at the nations, the people around us, the world and the fun they seem to be having, but really is a trip to nowhere. Let us look to Jesus. I'm sure there are many other ways of escape that God has provided. These are a few that came to my mind. Are you facing sin tonight? Is it something that's taking hold in your life? If you're here tonight, and you're not a Christian, there is no hope outside the gospel message of Jesus Christ. There is no hope outside what God has done for us in Jesus Christ, but thank God there is hope in Christ. And that's what he has provided for you. And so if you're not a Christian, you have an opportunity to accept the invitation of God, believing that Jesus is the Christ, repenting of your lifestyle of sin and turning away from that, turning to serve Him. confessing that Jesus is the Christ and being baptized in the water for the forgiveness of your sins. When you do that you can be raised to walk in newness of life. That's our theme this year. It's what God. We may feel hopeless and out of sorts, and we can't do anything by ourselves, but God will raise us up. And that's a beautiful picture. It may be that you're a Christian and struggling with sin. Remember that when you become a Christian you don't become immune to sin, is still can be a struggle. And so you got to face that you got to seek to overcome it. And it may mean that you need the prayers of the saints here tonight. And if that's the situation, if we can help you in any way, please come as we stand and sing at this time.
