Good evening. It's good to see everyone here tonight, it's good that we have an opportunity to be able to gather, gather, and worship our God, we have several visitors here with us, we want you to know you're our honored guest, we're glad you're with us and invite you back any chance that you haven't an opportunity. Big things come in small packages. That's a truth that we know. In fact, if you've ever seen a man proposed to a woman, you might see him take a little box, and there's a ring inside. And so even though that box is small, it's something that's very big and meaningful. It's impactful. Maybe a illustration that would make sense somewhat to this congregation, I think of babies. Sometimes they can scream really loud, right when they want their food, or even thought about the toddlers, the amount of personality that you're able to get in one of those small ones. Maybe that makes sense to some of you. Big things come in small packages. I think we also see that in the Scriptures if you would open your Bibles to Luke chapter 19. Luke chapter 19. I'd like to look at Jesus and Zacchaeus. And the big things that came from a little man, big things that came from a little man. I'll have to pause here and and commend the lesson that Conrad gave this morning. It was an excellent lesson. And in fact, if you didn't have a chance to hear it, and go online, and you can listen to it, I will be hitting some of the same themes, in part because I'm looking at Luke in just a few chapters over and Luke hit some of those same themes. But I think, I think we'll make it through even though I'll be overlapping just just slightly. Big things come in little packages, and we see big things coming from Zacchaeus. Let me simply start by by reading this text and Luke 19 verses one through 10.

Jeremy Sweets  02:15
He entered Jericho and was passing through. And behold, there was a man named Zacchaeus. He was a chief tax collector and was rich, and he was seeking to see who Jesus was. But on account of the crowd, he could not because he was small in stature. So he ran on ahead and climbed up into a sycamore tree to see him for he was about to pass that way. And when Jesus came to the place, he looked up and said to him, Zacchaeus, hurry and come down, For I must stay at your house today. So he hurried and came down and received him joyfully. And when they saw it, they all grumbled, he has gone into be the guest of a man who is a sinner is IKEA stood and said to the Lord, behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor. And if I have defrauded anyone of anything, I restore it four fold. And Jesus said to him, Today salvation has come to this house, since he also is a son of Abraham, for the Son of Man came to seek and to save the law. Here we see Jesus as He is passing through as he is coming to Jericho, that the the crowds were surrounding. They wanted to hear and to see Jesus and that's also true of one that was Zacchaeus Zacchaeus. As we sing the song was a wee little man, he was short in stature, the text says, but we also see that there are some big things that are going to come from Zacchaeus. The first thing we see is that Zacchaeus was a big center, a big center. And verse two, it says, And behold, there was a man named Zacchaeus. He was a chief tax collector, and he was rich. In the Roman Empire, collecting taxes was often a contract that was given to a wealthy individual. And that wealthy individual oftentimes they would be a foreigner, they would hire local people in order to collect the taxes and the tolls. And so they would go through the business of collecting taxes or maybe looking at goods as they traveled and and collecting a toll for those things. And tax collectors were not viewed favorably. The Harper dictionary I thought I would just simply read a portion of the entry there. to relay this it says tax collectors were responsible for paying to the government the revenue they had promised in obtaining their contract, but they were genuinely free to collect extra taxes from the people in order to make profit. Opportunities for theft, fraud and corruption are bounded and tax collectors are portrayed negatively in almost all Greco Roman literature. Tax Collector ers were hated. They were despised. They were seen as those that were corrupt. And in a sense, they were traitors of the community. Here were people within their own community that were that were loving extra taxes on them that were getting rich off the backs of others. They were seen as those that were taking an advantage. Tax collectors were a picture I believe of selfishness in the New Testament that would have been the image of the mind, or the picture that people of the first century would have thought of. These people are simply taking advantage. In the New Testament, tax collectors and sinners. Those two items are placed side by side and at least three different places in Matthew 911 1119, and also Luke 15 And verse one, tax collectors and sinners, they were thrown in the same group together now notice is IKEA's, the text says that he was a chief tax collector, and he was rich. Those are placed side by side for you to see that he was rich, because of his tax collecting, most likely, it was this, this job that made him wealthy, and it was this job that would have made him despised by the community around here we see that Zacchaeus was a little man, but he was a big sinner, I think the text suggests,

we also see that Zacchaeus had a big heart, a big heart. And verse three, it says, And he was seeking to see who Jesus was. But on account of the crowd, he could not because he was small in stature. So he ran on ahead and climbed up into a sycamore tree to see him, for he was about to pass that way. Now, while we as a society, in our culture are preoccupied with outward appearance, God prizes and values, the heart. And you can tell that just by the literature that's put out the world today, if you go to the supermarket, five quick, easy steps to lose weight or to lose your wrinkles or, or how you can lose weight, you don't see things like this six, six steps to a better character. I've never once seen that when walking through the grocery store.

Jeremy Sweets  07:31
It is all about the outward appearance, what you look like is perceived to be the most important. I looked up the industry for the cosmetics and makeup industry. It's a $62 billion industry in the United States. Now, there's nothing wrong with these things and of themselves. But when they they become prioritized when they are put above all else, there is a big problem. So the world puts out how to look good. But what does God's word put out? Is it about how we're to look? No, it's about how to be good and do good. It focuses on the character because we know that God values the heart. I have to say right up front, that is a challenge for us in this country, because we're bombarded with the other message. And our natural inclinations is to judge people based upon how they look. But let me just simply point out, that's not what Jesus did. That is not what God does. In First Samuel 16 And verse seven, it says, But the Lord said to Samuel, do not look on his appearance or on the height of his stature because I've rejected him. For the Lord sees not as a man sees man looks at the outward appearance, but he looks but the Lord looks on the heart. There it's discussing Samuel or Saul, as he was one that was tall and looked like a king. But the message is that he was to be rejected. And as Samuel looked at the brothers, the sons of Jesse, he went through each one. And finally it was the youngest. It was David that was to be selected. Because God values and prizes and cherishes the heart. He's not as concerned with our outside appearance. That's not what is important. So the first thing to notice is that Jesus was looking for a big heart. That's what he noticed. He was not concerned with how tall Zacchaeus was. We sometimes rate people based upon those things, how good they are based upon physical appearances, but that's not what God does at all. Not only that, but Zacchaeus was small in stature, but he didn't allow that. to keep him from seeing Jesus tech says that he wanted to see Jesus, he was seeking to see Jesus and you see a little bit of that, that determination, that strong desire, he was one that was not going to say, Well, I'm simply not tall enough. So I can't see him. He didn't turn around and go back and say, there's nothing I can do. No, but he was eager. And he was seeking a way to see Jesus. And it says that he climbed up in a tree. Now, we might not think much about that we read through this text quite often and have heard this story before we tell the story to tell our children but that would have been unconventional and uncommon. In fact, that would have been viewed as as immature and improper, really, it's hard for us to imagine someone in a suit that's going outside coming out of a business meeting and going and climbing up a tree, your thought, that doesn't go together. Well, I believe that would have been the picture here of Zacchaeus as well, because I can't didn't let that stop him either. He wasn't worried about whether this was considered so called proper proper for society, he wanted to see Jesus and he was going to do whatever he could to see him. Zacchaeus embodies the picture of one who is truly seeking, he tells us what it means to be one who is seeking in Matthew seven and verse seven, it says, Ask and it shall be given to you seek and you will find, knock and the door will be open to you. We see Zacchaeus is one who is seeking after when, when there are those that are seeking after God, he will be found. You can't say I didn't find him immediately, I'm going to turn around and give up. That's not the picture of seeking but one who continues and it captures their heart so that they want to see Jesus more than anything. And proverbs eight and verse 17, it says, I love those who love me, and those who seek me find me Zacchaeus had a big heart, and he wanted to see Jesus more than anything else. And so that's something that we can learn from. So, IKEA's Zacchaeus also had big potential, big potential, notice in verses five through seven.

Jeremy Sweets  12:29
And when Jesus came to the place, he looked up and said to him, Zacchaeus, hurry and come down, for I'm a stay at your house today. So he hurried and came down and received him joyfully. And when they saw it, they all grumbled, he has gone in to be the guest of a man who is a sinner. See, Jesus is the perfect reflection of God. Not only is he one that looks at the heart, and not the outward appearance, but he's also one that does not simply restrict a person to what they have done previously. Jesus is one that saw the potential in Zacchaeus, he saw not only what he had done, not only what he was, but what he could be. Now that stands is a stark contrast with the people around what did they see when they saw Zacchaeus? This man is a sinner. Period, there is no need to go further. We already know who he is. This man is a sinner. He's not worthy. You don't need to be associated with him. There needs to be a stark, definite distinction, keep him away. We don't interact. This man is a sinner. He needs to stay away. And we need to stay away. If we are truly to be pure. I believe the thought was, but that's not how Jesus saw his eye key is. Jesus saw one who could repent. Jesus saw one who could respond to the gospel. What a beautiful thing that is. Jesus is the perfect embodiment of God, the greatest evangelist because he knew God was God and invited people to God. One of the things that made him such a strong soul winner was that he saw the potential in people. He saw what they could be and he invited them into something that was good. You know, the jails are filled with people that have followed this kind of self fulfilling prophecy. They've been told all of their life. You won't amount to anything. You're no good. You know what, and people listen to that long enough. They believe that and they act accordingly. But Jesus saw potential Regardless of what he had done in the past, Jesus saw the potential for change. Oh, that we could develop the heart of Jesus here and see the potential. Oh, that we could develop the heart of God members, God is always inviting people to come back. Notice his track record with Israel, they went into sin, but God was always wanting them to repent. He gave them opportunity to repent, he sent his prophets to them so that they would repent his heart and his desire is that they would do what was right, that they would change. That's God's hope. And if we're to be His disciples, that needs to be our hope, as well. We can be a reflection of God's hearts, when we see the potential in other people as well. For someone that's been told all their life, you don't amount to anything. It makes such a huge impact. And a huge difference. If someone comes along and says, No, you can be a child of God. You belong, God cares about you, and God loves you. You have potential to be something good, something formed in the image of Christ. I don't think we realize how powerful that message is. And so we need to have an evangelistic heart that reaches out to people and sees the potential just like Jesus did. Let us not be like the people around pre judging and saying, well, that person will never do what try that person. Do you know what they've done? Haven't you heard about what they've done in the past? Well, that may be true, and some people will not change. But we need to see the potential in people that they can change. And I'd be I believe, people will respond to this message. They thrive on this, this positive enforcement that they can be somebody and they are somebody in the very sight of God. Yes, Zacchaeus had big potential. Now I believe that Jesus saw that potential.

Jeremy Sweets  17:14
Notice further in verse eight Zacchaeus, brought big repentance, the big repentance in verse eight, it says, And Zacchaeus stood and said to the Lord, behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor. And if I have defrauded anyone of anything, I restore it for full. Well, this passage is part of a larger section. And Luther, that really goes back to chapter 18 And verse nine, and you can see the themes even elsewhere, that that deals with spiritual and physical wealth and poverty is it It illustrates the spiritual message through the physical. And it talks about the perceptions of both. In fact, in chapter 18, and verse nine, it says, He also told this parable to some who trusted in themselves, that they were righteous and treated others with contempt. And then Jesus goes on to talk about the prayers of the the humble public, enter tax collector, and the proud Pharisee and ask which one was right before God. We see just shortly after this and verse 18, through 30 of chapter 18, the rich young ruler, as he asked, What more should I do? I've kept these commandments for my youth, what more should I do? Jesus says, give away your possessions. And chapter 18 And verse 35. As a contrast, here we see a blind beggar that is calling out to Jesus to heal him. And this blind beggar receives God's or the love of Jesus, compassion and healing. And we see that he has commended for his faith, this one in poverty. And now we come to Zacchaeus. Zacchaeus is one that brings repentance. He's wealthy, yet he does what is right with his money. In fact, one of the best examples to place this beside is the rich young ruler. You notice that both of them were rich or wealthy. Both of them had a high office of political or civil standing in the community. Both encountered Jesus with their wealth as a competing priority in their service to Jesus. When Jesus said to the rich young ruler to give away all that you have, remember that he was asking what do I need to do? He said, give away all that you have. He seems to refuse. He at least initially goes away dismayed at the request, but was IKEA's there is no command In Zacchaeus, freely offers Zacchaeus doesn't wait to be told, he simply says this is what I'm going to do. This is what I plan to do to give away half of my possessions. And if I've wronged anybody, which would have been a very common thing for a publican to take too much, five, wrong, the new one, I will restore four fold our store four fold. Now, the Roman tax system was a system of corruption. It was, you know, greased wheels, it was something that was it was simply corrupt in the way that it was carried out. But notice, it's like that Zacchaeus is making an effort to bring integrity to a situation that was often corrupt. And he's going to do it at great personal price is going to do it at a great loss to himself. And so we see this one he gives, and he gives, sometimes the question is asked, do we have to give away everything like the rich young ruler, and I think it's IKEA's shows us that it's not necessarily, it's not necessary to give away all that we have. But it is necessary that we are generous. And that's exactly what Conrad spoke about. This morning. We must be generous, we must be giving. And we see that in Zacchaeus. He is one that is that is generous. And he's generous, even in his repentance, even in trying to give back and make right, he doesn't want to find the line and go just there. That's not his heart, but he wants to freely give. We see in Zacchaeus, big repentance, big repentance, and we need to emulate that. We also see a big salvation, a big salvation in verses nine and 10.

Jeremy Sweets  22:09
Jesus said to him Today salvation has come to this house, since he also is a son of Abraham, for the Son of Man came to seek and to save the law. The Pharisees had restricted salvation to their group, and said, we are saying, and they did not look to anyone else there. But Jesus is not seeking to restrict salvation. But rather, he's expanding that and inviting all to come. And so he says here that salvation has come to this house. Now, even though Zacchaeus would have been looked down upon in society, even though the religious leaders did not consider as IKEA says, As a upstanding member of society are one worthy of the gospel. Jesus says salvation has come to this house. He is also a son of Abraham. It's not restricted to the Pharisees. It's not for the Pharisees alone. It's not for those that are self righteous at all. It is for those that have the heart of Zacchaeus. And Jesus is freely offering salvation to those that have the same kind of heart and willingness and humility. He says in verse 10, for the Son of Man came to seek and save the last. That's what he has come to do. Consider all the things that Jesus could have done. When he came to this earth. He could have if it was his desire, created a strong military presence that would have wiped out every nation around, he could have built a tremendous amount of wealth for himself. He could have been the most popular person in all the world. He could have been a great king in a physical sense, there are a lot of things he could have done. But why did Jesus come? What was his purpose? His purpose was to seek and save the walls. And I love this picture here of describing Jesus is seeking we've already seen, I think it's IKEA's is seeking. And when we have sinners that are seeking we had Jesus that is seeking, they will find one another. They will find one another, for Jesus has come to seek and to save the law. So in answer to the Pharisees, Jesus says, that's why I'm here. I'm not going to push the sinners away and simply be with those that are the religious leaders. Now he was going to go to the centers. It was intentional that he would eat with centers and converse with sinners and talk to sinners. Not only that, but there's another question that hangs in the text. And I think this again hangs from the rich young ruler. After Jesus answered the rich young ruler, and he says that he went away dismayed, and Luke 18 And verse 24. He concludes his interaction in this way, how difficult it is for those who have wealth to enter the kingdom of God. For it is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich person to enter the kingdom of God. Those who heard it said then who can be saying, Jesus says, give away your possessions Be a giver. That's what's required. The rich young ruler ruler went away this made and the disciples understood that. That's a difficult saying. And if you're saying that, that it's impossible, they seem to think it's not something that who can be saved? I think Luke answers that question as we go further down with with the story of Zacchaeus, a wealthy man who can be saved Zacchaeus Ken, he had wealth, but he was willing to give, he was willing to humble himself. He was willing to give that up for the Lord. Do you have to have Well, no, we saw just the passage earlier with the blind beggar. Jesus healed him and commended his faith. Our bank account is really not what is important to God. We care a lot about those things. We care about how we look and how much money we have in the bank and how popular we are. But But God doesn't care about those things. But he does care about our heart.

Jeremy Sweets  26:55
So what amount of attention? Are we paying to each one of those things? Do we spend hours of the day looking at all these other things that deal with our health and our looks and our money? And then just give God the leftovers or heart or character just a small amount? Don't you realize it should be the other way around where our priority is our character and doing what is right. That is what is needed. I was thinking about this in relationship to a steward as well. I think the world considers a steward successful if they make the most money. But that's that's not how God views success for a steward. Being a faithful steward is not simply about making the most money, but it's about doing what is right being faithful to the character of God. Now, I believe that will bring an increase I believe that that those that seek after God that it is possible that they will make money, it's possible that they will be persecuted and to not make money. But we see that God favors and values our character who we are. So let us also value that as well. As a way of an invitation. Let us look at his IKEA's as an example of one that has the heart that we need to have. He was one that sought after Jesus, he did not let anything get in his way. He joyously received and he was so glad that Jesus would come into his house, he freely offered repentance. He quickly wanted to do what is right, to remove a lifestyle of sin and to serve Him in all things, and he served Jesus. Let us do the same thing. Let us have this kind of heart if we are to be right before God, God has extended and given to us Jesus Christ so that we can be saved. It's not something we could have done on our own. We must simply respond in humble obedient faith. There's any subject to the invitation at this time. Please come as we stand and sing
