If you have your Bibles and want to be opening up to Luke chapter 16.

Luke chapter 16, is where we're going to study for the rest of our time.

Conrad Harkrider  00:23
When I was in middle school, I was able to start up a little lawn mowing business there in the neighborhood where we lived. And one of the jobs that I landed was a corner house, which those yards are typically bigger than the other lots in the neighborhood. And this is down in South Texas where the grass seems to grow about an inch every single day. So you have to be on it, you have to be mowing your yard every single week, or it can get out of hand. While this particular corner lot, there was one occasion where I was too busy on the weekend, and so I wasn't able to go and, and and do my, my responsibilities. And then another week came and same thing happened, I got too busy and I wasn't able to go and mow the grass. And so finally after two and a half weeks, I made it over to the house, I got into the yard and it looked like a jungle pretty much. And so I fired up the mower and walked a few steps and it killed off because it was just it was too much. So I raised up the blade as high as I could and mowed a few more strips and was struggling with it. But eventually, I had to quit I just left it partially mowed and went back to the house. Now a couple of weeks. About a week later, I got a letter in the mail from the customer saying that my services were no longer needed. I couldn't believe it. No, of course I could believe it, because who wants a half mowed yard out in front of their house? This year 2018. We're talking about stewardship and one of the primary tenants of stewardship of being faithful stewards. Is the idea of being entrusted with something having responsibility or ownership over something. And then what do we do with it? How do we handle those blessings, those gifts, those abilities that God has entrusted to us. This morning, I want to look at a very interesting parable from the book of Luke, as Jesus tells about the parable of the unjust steward. And here we hear about a man who was in a job, and eventually he is told that he is going to be fired. And he responds in a way that ultimately when he hears about the news of him losing his job, he responds in a way that causes his master to commend him. So let's look at this parable together. Luke chapter 16, beginning in verse one. It says, He also said to his disciples, there was a certain rich man who had a steward, and an accusation was brought to him that this man was wasting his goods. So he called him and said to him, What is this that I hear about you give an account of your stewardship, for you can no longer be steward. Then the steward said within himself, What shall I do? For my master is taking the stewardship away from me, I cannot dig, I am ashamed to beg, I have resolved what to do that when I am put out of the stewardship, they may receive me into their houses. So he called every one of his masters debtors to him and said to the first, how much do you owe my master? And he said, 100 measures of oil. So he said to him, take your bill, sit down quickly, and write 50 And he said to another, how much do you owe? So he said, 100 measures of wheat. And he said to him, take your bill and write 80 So the master commended the unjust steward because he had dealt shrewdly, for the sons of this world are more shrewd in their generation than the sons of light. And I say to you make friends for yourselves by unrighteous mammon, that when you fail, that when you fail, they may receive you into an everlasting home. He who is faithful, in what is least is faithful also in much and he who is unjust, in what is least, is unjust also in much, therefore, if you have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon who We'll commit to your trust, the true riches. And if you have not been faithful in what is another man's, who will give you what is your own, No servant can serve two masters for either he will hate the one and love the other or else he will be loyal to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and mammon.

Conrad Harkrider  05:25
This parable has caused a tremendous amount of confusion and misunderstanding because why does Jesus use and illustrate someone who is a dishonest or unjust manager or steward? Well, before we get into that, notice that this parable is the last in a series of four starting in Luke chapter 15. And notice the audience and the setting to which Jesus is giving this series of parables Luke chapter 15, beginning in verse one, it says, all the tax collectors and the sinners drew nearer to him. And the Pharisees and the scribes complain, saying this man receives sinners and eats with them. And so he spoke to them these parables, Jesus is responding to the challenge of the Pharisees, they are upset with him, because this teacher this rabbi is eating with people who have who are of low moral class, the tax collectors and the senators. Also notice in chapter 16, and verse 14, at the end of the parables, it says, Now the Pharisees who were lovers of money, also heard all these things, and they derided him. The Pharisees wanted nothing to do with the sinful people of the world. And yet, but here's what they do, love and care about, they care about money, they are concerned, they are lovers of money. So Jesus gives this parable about this steward who is in charge of a house in response to this attitude of the Pharisees. He tells about this man who has control over the house, he is in charge of all of his possessions. If you remember, in Genesis 39, when Joseph was made, the manager over potter's house, were told that Potiphar left everything in his hand, there was nothing that belonged to him, that was not in Josephs control under his responsibility. So there is a great amount of trust that is placed in this individual. But look what it says in verse one. It says that an accusation was brought to him that this man was wasting his goods. Imagine if you had given all of your money to a financial advisor, a person who is supposed to be wise and understanding and make good business decisions, and yet you find out that they are squandering your money. They're spending it in ways that they shouldn't be using it and probably not going to be very happy about that. And so this master calls his steward in to give an account explain what's going on here. Why is this occurring? And the master tells him essentially, that he's going to be fired, he's going to be let go. In verse two, or in verse three, when the steel, the steward realizes that he is about to be unemployed, he starts to think to himself, What is my next step here? Where am I going to go after this? What's my plan of action, he thinks to himself, I'm not going to go out and get a manual labor job, I'm not going to dig. And then he also realizes that he's too ashamed or maybe too proud to go and beg. And so he decides instead to come up with a plan. He invites the debtors, those people who owed something to his master to come in.

Conrad Harkrider  09:23
And he says to them, in verse five, he calls the first one in and he asks him how much he owes. How much do you owe my master? The first man comes in he says, 100 measures of oil, a measure of oil would have been about six to eight gallons of oil. So this is not just a few jugs of oil. Imagine 600 to 800 gallons of oil in debt, not something that you just throw on the donkey and bring over to the house. So he takes this enormous sum and he says, I want you to cut it in half, I want you to take your bill and write 50. Imagine, if you had a large sum of a large amount of student loans, say $100,000 in debt, some of you don't have to imagine that's, that's reality. But imagine, if one of your neighbors said, You know what, I'm going to write you a write a check to the bank or to the loan administrator, and I'm going to write it for $50,000, I'm going to take away half of that debt, how you feel about that neighbor, you're gonna let that neighbor borrow your ladder. If he needs it, you're gonna watch the negative neighbor's dog when he goes out of town, you're probably willing to do whatever is necessary to help to give to that person. And that's kind of the plan here. He's thinking about gaining the favor, and the good reporter with all of these, these credit or these debtors, so that when he loses his job, when he's out on the streets, someone will take him in. So the next letter comes in. It's a man who owes 100 measures of wheat, he tells him, I want you to cut it to 80, just like that 20% discount off of what is owed. Not sure why he gives different amounts of concession to each of these, these debtors, but maybe he wanted it to seem like more more realistic, like each person was getting a personalized agreement. If he just gave everyone half off, it might be more suspicious. But whatever the case, it seems as if he picks very arbitrary amounts, to release them in their debts. Now, the question is, did he have the right to do this? As the steward of the house, he has responsibility over all of his masters possessions. And as the disciples and those who are hearing this parable for the first time, as they were listening to it, what do you think they thought the ending of the parable was going to be? They hear about this guy going around and reducing everyone's debts and making all these back end deals. And they must have thought when the master finds out about this, this guy is in trouble. This guy is going to get it. He's going to get what's coming to him. But look what he says in verse eight. It says when the so when so the master commended the unjust steward because he dealt shrewdly, the New American Standard says that he praised him. How could he be praised for what he was doing? And beyond that, what is Jesus saying? What is he teaching the people? Is he saying that we should do what is whatever is necessary to gain the favor of others? Is Jesus saying that if you find out that you're possibly going to lose your job, then you should do whatever you whatever you can to gain the favor of others, whether it's dishonest or not, is he allowing for unjust dealings with other people? Notice what Jesus, he still refers to this man in verse eight. He calls him the unjust or the DIS honest, Steward, or manager. It wasn't because of his faithful or honorable character character that he's being praised here, but rather, his shrewdness. He was practical. He was wise. He was quick in his thinking. My wife was a high school teacher for a number of years. And

Conrad Harkrider  14:04
there was one year that a group of seniors pulled off an amazing prank at the end of the school year, they were able to get access to the building, and they filled up over 1000 plastic cups of water and place them all along the hallways of the school. They even managed to spell out their graduation year 2012. Most of the cups were white, and they put 2012 in red. Some of the young people are taking notes right now. But it was amazing. And when the teachers got there, they were taking pictures of it. They were texting friends, they were telling other other people about it. Now what they did was wrong. It was against school policy to go and to do that. It created a huge mess. They actually delayed school a couple of Bauer's so that they could clean it up. But you had to admire the creativity and the planning and the execution that allowed it to happen. And so I believe Jesus is not saying do exactly as this man did go be a dishonest manager. But instead, he's highlighting the resourcefulness, the ingenuity, the acumen that this man shows, when he realized that his job was about to end, he got to work, he took action. And he used his position and the opportunities that were available to him. And he uses it in a way to benefit his situation. So what is this parable, teaching us? Well, first of all, I think it says something about learning from the example of others, regardless if that person is righteous, or if they're wicked, there are things that we can see from people in the world. attitudes or disciplines or commitments that they show. That can be an example to us. Also, this parable is focusing on the idea of money. Look at verse nine, it says, He who is faithful, or it says, and I say to you make for yourselves friends, by unrighteous mammon, the word Mammon or wealth is used in verse nine, verse 11, and verse 13. Jesus is emphasizing the use of a person's money, their wealth, their possessions, in this life. Also notice verse 10. He says, He who is faithful and what is least, is faithful also in much, verse 11. Therefore, if you have not been faithful in the unrighteous mammon, verse 12. And if you have not been faithful in what is another man's, who will give you what is your own.

Conrad Harkrider  17:09
The point the idea here, that we need to be faithful with money. The dishonest steward acted shrewdly and wisely with what had been given to him, in order that he could be received into people's houses. And in the same way, God's people are to be shrewd and wise, with the wealth that they have been given, so that they can be welcomed into an eternal home. The point is, if we are not responsible with earthly possessions, why would God give us innumerable riches in heaven? If we cannot oversee and take care of the little earthly wealth that we have now, then why would God give us a much greater reward in the future, we must be faithful in the little things that we have now, in order to receive the true riches of eternity. When it comes to Christians and monies, there are two different extremes. On the one hand, you have the the prosperity gospel, the prosperity gospel says that if you serve God, if you come to Christ, then he is going to bless you with great possessions in this life. And people will use all kinds of ways to draw people in that promotion that you want. You need a bigger house, you want a better car, you want to make more money, then come to the Lord God wants to bless you with more possessions. And that kind of teaching actually creates a sense of greed and expectation. For more, it's the prosperity gospel. There's also the poverty gospel. And this is the idea that Christians should be people who are poor, not just poor in spirit, but financially and physically we should be poor. After all, in Luke chapter 18, Jesus did tell the rich young ruler to sell all that he had and give to the poor. Jesus himself was a man who was taken care of by other people, he was not a wealthy person. And so Christians today should be those who lack financial means. I believe both of these ideologies or beliefs are flawed. God is not concerned with making sure that each of us has plenty of money. Nor is he insisting that we become financially destitute. Ultimately, the focus is on faith. fullness, it's on stewardship on wisdom on using what God has given to us in a wise and discreet way, whatever we have, how are we using those blessings? So in the in this parable, what does he say about being faithful with our money? What does that actually mean? Look at verse nine. It says, and I say to you make friends for yourselves by unrighteous mammon, that when you that when you fail, they may receive you into an everlasting home. Verse nine, Jesus says, Make friends with your money, make friends with your money, he says, use your worldly possessions to gain friends. That seem a little odd. Simply put, I believe Jesus is saying Be generous towards others, be giving and generous towards other people. If people thought about you or me in the way that we handle our money, would they describe us as generous people? If I came into a financially distressing situation, I lost all of my money.

Conrad Harkrider  21:21
Would there be enough goodwill among friends, family, co workers, people in the community that they would actually take me in? They would say this guy has given so much I want to help him out. How do people view our giving? Have you ever known someone who is extremely generous, that no one liked? I'm sure there are some exceptions. But typically, we don't say I can't stand that guy. Because he is always buying people lunch, you know, or There they go, again, having people into their home or you know, she just frustrates me she is always giving to the cause every single year. No, we don't think that like like that. Because generosity generally produces favor with others. It shows your heart, it is a tangible way of expressing care for someone else. Growing up, I had a friend and every time we went over to his house, his mom would ask us the same question. Do you want something to eat? And the answer was always yes, it didn't matter if it was in the middle of the day, nine o'clock at night. We were always hungry. And she must have planned for this because it seemed as if she had a stockpile of frozen pizzas, always on hand. And she would sort of bait you into it. She'd get the knife out. And she would start slicing the cake and say, Can I get you a piece of this chocolate cake, almost like you had to say yes. But you know how we felt about going over to that house.

Unknown Speaker  23:04
We loved it. We loved it.

Conrad Harkrider  23:09
We often think to ourselves, I want to be more generous. I want to help and feed hungry teenagers. But I need more money. If I had more money, then I would be more generous. Being rich is a relative term. Millions of people throughout the world sleep on the floor every night. They live in, they live in makeshift shanty homes, their kids run around barefoot with wearing tattered clothes. And when you compare our country to the rest of the world, many of the people in the lower 10% The welfare those who are on government assistance, they would be considered middle class in other parts of the world. We are tremendously blessed to live in this country. And if if you doubt that you need you should travel you should go somewhere else. Go to another part of the world see for yourself the blessings that we have, and we shouldn't fool ourselves into thinking that if I just had more than I would start giving to others. You know giving requires capacity. I think sometimes living in this culture, we often fall into the trap where every single dollar of income is spoken for. We have the house and the car and the food and the bills and the diapers and the pets. And then we have to buy clothes for ourselves and go out to eat and then have some entertainment and hobbies. And we get through all of that and there's nothing left. Every dollar is smoke Going for where can we free up some capacity? Where can we take some things off of our plate, get out of that, that that subscription, you know, cancel that vacation, limit the shopping, loosen things up so that we have money set aside so that we can give, so that when there is opportunity we have the ability to share. Being generous doesn't always mean writing a check could be taking someone food, making cookies, offering your home, giving a ride, offering up your services or your time to another person, but sharing with those around us. And you know, the greatest example of generosity is Jesus Himself. Jesus gave up all of the riches of heaven, he became poor for our sakes. During his ministry, he was constantly helping and teaching and healing and ministering to other people. And ultimately, he gave his life on the cross so that we can be saved from our sins. Being generous is a part of the fabric of every Christian or it should be a part of the fabric of every Christian. We cannot serve the giver of every perfect good and perfect gift without being givers ourselves, that should describe us. Also, notice in verse nine, he says, that you should make for yourselves friends by unrighteous wealth, so that when it fails, they can receive you into an everlasting hole. The ESV translates that when it fails, not if it fails. But when it fails. And that is the idea that money by its very nature is transient, it's fluid. It's here one day and it's gone. The next things may be going really well right now. You may be disciplined in your spending and saving and have the six to 12 months saved up. But that all can change in an instant. That we have to ask ourselves, where are we putting our trust, our confidence, our hope, our assurance. In 2008, during the financial crisis, experts say that the suicide rate went up by 9% in the US and Canada. In the years following the financial damage downturn, 1000s of people around the world took their lives, their own lives because they lost everything. When the economy lags and drops, there is real suffering that occurs. But it highlights the importance of knowing where we place our hope,

Conrad Harkrider  28:07
is our hope in the prospect of home prices continuing to rise. Because when they drop sharply, it does start to feel like the end of the world. The question is not if things are going to turn it's when. And even if your wealth does not fail you in this life one day, your wealth will no longer be an asset to you. As one writer said, 60 seconds after you're dead, you can no longer sign a cheque. You can't take it with you. And so how are we using all that God has given to us? Are we using it for his purposes? Are we making deposits into a heavenly account? In Luke chapter 12, and verse 33, it says, sell your possessions and give to the needy provide yourself with moneybags that do not grow old, with a treasure in the heavens that does not fail, where no thief approaches and no moth destroys. You want an investment that never declines in value that can never decrease or depreciate make a contribution into the heavenly bank account by offering by giving by serving others. And finally, we'll close with verse 13. Verse 13, says No servant can serve two masters for either he will hate the one and love the other or else who he will be loyal to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and money The point the emphasis for us is to serve God and use money, not the other way around where we serve money, and then just use God for a little side portion of of our life, making God our entire focus and then seeing our financial means and resources as a tool, as an instrument to be used in his kingdom. Money is a tool, not a God, not something to be worshipped and bow down to, but something to be steward over. To be discreetly used in a wise way use money and serve God. And Jesus really emphasizes to them that you can only have one God, you can only have one master, we have to make the choice either to serve God. Or if we're going to serve the things of this world. How can we be more faithful stewards over all that God has entrusted to us? Are we using our money in a wise and discreet way? Or have we found ourselves squandering those things? Just as this manager was called in to give an account, one day all of us will stand before the Lord and give an accounting for the way that we've used all that God has blessed us with. We're going to close with a song and an invitation. We use it as an opportunity to encourage those who are here if there's something that we can do to help you and your walk and your relationship with Christ. Please come down to the front as we stand and sing
