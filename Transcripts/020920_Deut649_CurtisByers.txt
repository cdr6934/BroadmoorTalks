Appreciate it, Kevin from excuse me, Evan clothes, appreciate Evan, leaving that song as come came from our reading. In fact, I would encourage you to go back and reopen to Deuteronomy, the sixth chapter. Deuteronomy, chapter six, we'll take our lesson from that text. In particular, verses four and five. It's good to have you all with us this morning, appreciate so much that you have been able to join us for our worship. If you're visiting with us, we're especially glad that she could be with us as we come together to worship our God. Unusual that I'm doing a double duty today. And we we have some good preachers here. I'm not one of them, but we will get preachers here. But as one of the elders, I do speak every four or five, six months before the congregation. And so it's my lot to do that this morning. I appreciate the opportunity to do that. I want us to relook at verses four through nine, Deuteronomy chapter six that we read earlier, but I like to read it again to kind of set the stage for our thoughts. So Deuteronomy, chapter six, beginning with verse four. In fact, the words are repeated in the song we just saw. Here, O Israel, the LORD our God, the Lord is one. You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul with all your mind. And these words that I command you today shall be on your heart. You shall teach them diligently to your children, and shall talk to them when they set in the house. And when you walk, by the way, when you lie down, and when you rise, you shall bind them as a sign on your hand, and they shall be as frontlets between your eyes. You shall write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates. When the Lord your God brings you into the land that he swore to your Abraham, Isaac and Jacob to give you that. And I'm going to stop there, I've learned stuff, verse nine, excuse me, you shall write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gaze. The opening words of verse four, Hear, O Israel, kind of remind us that Deuteronomy is a recorded sermon. If you go back to the very first chapter, first verse of the book, we read there that these are the words that Moses spoke to all Israel beyond the Jordan in the wilderness, the foreign force, remember that God, we brought them out of Egypt with a powerful hand, his intent was to take the children of Israel into the land that he had promised in the promised land, the land of Canaan. And you have to people because their lack of belief, last lack of faith in God, they were forced to wonder throughout the wilderness for a period of 40 years, as punishment, for not believing that God could give them the land. One generation died out another generation as has arisen. Now they're on they're on the verge of entering into the keynoter the east side of the Jordan. And they're about ready to pass over the Jordan and the glory will divide the waters there for them as well. And before they go in, Moses takes advantage of this opportunity to remind them all that the Lord has done that sermon that he gave him that speech that he gave us was recorded in this book, the book of Deuteronomy. The word Deuteronomy means the second law, because many of the laws that were already written in the Pentateuch in the Torah, are repeated, and pause. So with that helps us understand that Moses is reminding them of what God has said, and what God at ask. This, these, this opening phrase here, oh, Israel, though, also kind of helps serve as a marker in the text. At the beginning of chapter five and verse one, we see that exact same phrase, hero, Israel, and Moses goes on to repeat to them, the 10 words, the 10 commandments that God had given them, mine sign on, then a verse for chapter six, where we are now reading, he is uses this phrase, again, as the introduction to this new section. And this section, as we can even see in the reading from this morning, has to do with the covenant that God had given them and obligations that they have under the covenant. And chapter nine, verse one, he will use the phrase to demark another section. But it's interesting at the end of this section that begin beginning chapter six and the ends there in chapter eight. To notice the last sentence, the last verse of this section, verse 20. There it says, If you forget, you shall perish because you will not obey the voice of the LORD your God. On

Curtis Byers  05:02
the words that Moses was now speaking the words that God has spoken to the children of Israel, they were words that were intended to be obeyed. So when we're calling upon to hear, we need to understand that we're also being called upon to obey. The things that we hear, simply listening is insufficient. A God's words not only have to be heard, they also have to be obeyed. There's something else interesting about this word here. That's the Hebrew word, Shimon. Now, you may have heard of that term before because the Jews have used that word to refer to this entire verse. Here, O Israel, the LORD our God, the Lord is One is a section of texts that the Jews call the Shimon. In fact, it would not be wrong to say that this verse is considered by Jews to be the most important verse, and all of the all the pentik, all the Torah. And you can see that because not only do they use that term, Shima to refer to this verse, by extension, they refer to all those verses we just read a moment ago, verses four through nine of Deuteronomy six. And with that, a couple on a couple other texts from the latter part of Deuteronomy and from the book of Numbers. And these verses comprise the daily prayer of the Jews of the Orthodox Jews, even to this day. Just as the verse seven said, that when you lie down and when you rise, you talk about the lowered, the Orthodox Jews will recite the Shema, this section of verses every morning when they awake and every morning before they go to bed at night. I don't know exactly when they started that practice. It appears it began sometime after the Jews returned from Babylonian captivity and rebuild the temple there in Jerusalem again. But this was their practice to keep the Lord before them always. This is the the Shema. The translation that I have read from is the English Standard translation. And it is a interesting verse, it says the Lord our God, the Lord is one now exactly what does that mean? The literal translation of this you'll notice doesn't have any verbs. This simply says y'all way our God y'all way one. Now y'all way the yhW Asian the pronunciation y'all way is a guess. That was the that was the name of God. That was a name that wish God made himself known to Moses and made himself known to the people of Israel. Most of our English translations simply will say the Lord, instead of writing his name. Some translations American Standard translation used to use the word Jehovah. And whenever this his name was as a way that they thought it best pronounced Jehovah or Yahweh. In any case, but notice it simply says, Yahweh our God, or Jehovah our God, Jehovah one, what is the meaning of that? Where Where does the verb Go? What verb should we insert in this text? One more thing about that before we look at that, in most manuscripts, Hebrew manuscripts. The scribes have enlarged, the last letter of the first word, and the last letter of the last word in this phrase. So when you come upon this text, if you're reading it in Hebrew manuscript, as the Jews would have done, it kind of that enlarged characters would have marked off this text as being something special is almost as if as a caution sign, saying, be aware of what you're about ready to read? Because these words are important words, and they need to be understood and read reverently. Isn't that a great way to think of the word of God? And that's the way they that's the way and it gives an indication of how they treated this particular verse in Scripture. There are 10 different ways that this phrase is translated into English.

Curtis Byers  09:48
The New Jerusalem Bible, they use the term Yahweh instead of the Lord but they say, the Yahweh or the Lord our God is one. The only God Now what is the thrust of that sentence? It seems to me that the point being made in this translation is that there is only one God, He is our God, but there is only one God. This is a statement of the monotheism, the one God believe, among the Jews. And surely that is a true statement. Other translations, such as the New Revised Standard translated this way, the Lord is our God, the Lord alone. Now seems to me that the thrust of this translation is to suggest that God is our only God. And his this shines is just because he is our only God is only to God that we give our loyalty. Our loyalty is not to be divided as be the concentrated and centered upon upon God. That's hard to know which of these two ways, you know was intended by the Lord when this statement was given through Moses was hard to know, both have relevance to the children of Israel, even at this point in time. You remember that, you know, the children of Israel, these people grew up, either in Egypt, but they were still quite young, or their parents had grown up in Egypt. And Egypt was a land full of gods. And so they had been surrounded by gods and they had forgotten God, the true God. And so they grew up in a polytheistic society. So they needed to be reminded that there aren't many gods, there is just one guy. But they also needed to remind it, and this is seems to be probably perhaps better suited to the context of Deuteronomy, that God had picked them out to be His people. God made a choice, he could have chosen any people in the world, he chose them to be His people. And as a result of his choice, they should reply righe, give him back and return their loyalty. So the second sentence makes wonderfully good sense as well, because we're getting ready to enter into a land that's also filled with idols. And they don't need to be tempted by those idols, they need to remain faithful and loyal to God. So perhaps we sort of just take both of these as the way that this verse was intended to be under stood. But notice that, you know, verse four itself is not a command. You know, Hear, O Israel, the LORD our God, the Lord is One is not a command is simply a statement of truth. But verse five, there is a there is a command that follows from that truthful statement. It is that you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul and with all your mind. Reflect on the first part of that you shall love the Lord your God. Now, we're familiar with this verse, maybe because we have read it and studied in the book of Deuteronomy. But more likely, we are mostly with this verse because this is the verse that Jesus refers to when he was approached and asked, What is the greatest commandment over in Mark, the 12th chapter. We're told when we just read it, he says, and one of the scribes came up and heard them disputing with one another. It seemed that he answered them, well ask him, which commandment is the most important of all, Jesus answered, the most important is here, O Israel, the LORD our God is one the Lord is one and you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul, with all your mind and with all your screens. In a second is this You shall love your neighbor as yourself. There is no other commandment greater than these. There's a parallel account in Matthew and Luke. And in those parallel accounts, we get the indication that the question was not really a sincere question that the question in fact, when Matthew were told that the question was put forward to Jesus to test him, much as the Pharisees had just tested Jesus with a question concerning the resurrection. Previously, the Sadducees should say potassium with the question because the resurrection.

Curtis Byers  14:31
But here, Mark, we're not giving any occasion of that. It seems that this is a sincere question that the Scribe is asking. The scribes were the scholars of the law. Their task was a writing the law but because they were literate, they can read and write the law. They could understand what the law wasn't. So they were a source of information concerning the law. And the Jews wanted to understand exactly what the law required to them. So they took it upon themselves to number all the commandments. I mean, if the commandments are important to be followed, shouldn't we know at least what they are? So the Jews had identify the scribes and the Pharisees and the lawyers had identified 613 different commands that were found within the law of Moses. As among some of the scribes, they would, they would discuss and they would debate which of those commands were more important than others, which were, they would use the term heavy, and which ones were liked. And it could be that that's described is coming to Jesus to find out his take of those 613 commandments, wishes the wishes, the greatest of those. And Jesus pointing back to this passage in Deuteronomy, chapter six, verse four, and he includes verse for other Matthew and Mark, Matthew, Luke did not do that, but includes verse for the hero, Israel, the LORD our God, the Lord is One, the Shima. Attached to that first command, the greatest command, Jesus gives a second command that they that we are to love our neighbor, as our self. So I think it's helpful to look at the follow up to this Jesus statement. This is what the scribe says in verse 34. You are right teacher, you have truly said that he is water, there is no other besides him. It sounds like he is taking, I know which translation he's following. With the first the second of the two that we were looking at, and to love Him with all the heart and with all the understanding with all the strength and to love was neighbor as one self is much more than the whole, that all Holbert offerings and sacrifices. That's an amazing insight that the scribe had, that he understood that the foundational obligation, as far as to love God and to love neighbor. And that was even more important than the sacrifices in the bird offerings wish the law and great detailed, told how the Israel's will do observe them. In verse 34, it says, When Jesus saw that he answered wisely, he said to him, You are not far from the kingdom of God. That's a recipe. That's a compliment that Jesus just gave him. Now, when we, when we stopped to think about this, and we see that Jesus has given us the first commandment, He's given us the second commandment, you know, we might be led to think that there's a third commandment and fourth commandment and a fifth commandment, yes. And so on that there's, there's a long list of up to 613. There's then that These just happen to be the two at the top of the list. I don't think that's the way we are to think of this and Matthew's account.

Curtis Byers  18:00
He uses this language in verse 40, of 22. He says, On these two commandments hang all the law and the prophets, that's the King James Version Can I like it better? I like that word hang. Right, in a support, all the other commandments are supported, they are suspended from they hang from these two commandments. They are the basis of all other commandments. If you understand these two, you understand all the others. If you do these two, you do all the others, right? All the Commandments can be understood as simply various particulars of these two commandments. And that's the way the Apostle Paul understood it as well. Over Romans 13 and first nine, Paul said for the commandments You shall not commit adultery, you should not murder You shall not steal, you shall not covet. In any other commandment are summed up in this word. You shall love your neighbor as yourself. Paul recites some of those 10 commandments, the second part of the 10 commandments, he recites those, he says, all those can be summed up, you know, they find their totality in the statement, you shall love your neighbor as yourself. And I think that insight is helpful to us to understand that these two commandments of loving God and loving neighbor, they're all inclusive, right? They they sum up everything, that the Lord expects, of their their fundamental principles of which we should live our lives. There's another thing though, about these and that is that they are tied together. They're not independent. And let me read First John, I think helps bring this out was there's many passages that would make this point and before We leave I would like to, at least for us have this before us. There First John 316 and 17. Jada says By this we know love, that he laid down his life for us. And we ought to lay down our lives for the brothers. And if anyone has the world's goods and see his brother need yet closes his heart against him, how does God's love abide in him? You got to understand John's language, his his vocabulary, where he expresses things sometimes a little different. When he says, talks about God's love abiding in Him, that means one who loves God, you know, so how can one say one loves God, if you close your heart against a brother, you see the point, you know, you can't love God without loving neighbor. This is a possible, you can't just do one of these without doing the other. Because if you don't do the other thing, you're not doing the first one, right? So it's not as if there's really two commandments, there's really one commandment that's just expressed in two ways. Or as two aspects that there's no coin on either side of the coin is the same thing. We are to love. And our love should be inclusive of God, and our love should be inclusive of our neighbor. And if this doesn't include both, then we're not doing either one, right? That's what Jesus would have been no. But let's get back to Deuteronomy, particularly where it's not only tells us the command, you shall love God, but also tells us how we are to fulfill that command. He says, we are to love God with all our heart and with all our soul. And with all our might. Those words are a little bit hard to distinguish. So exactly what they refer to the term heart, and soul often occur together in the Old Testament, at least 10 times in the book of Deuteronomy, the children of Israel are told to do something with all their heart, and with all their souls. So that combination, that coupling is common. In fact, if you go through the look at those, they are told to serve God with all their heart, and with all their soul, they are told to obey God, and oh, keep the commandments and turn to the Lord, and walk in his ways, and to repent with all their heart and with all their soul. Those are things that are to be done.

Curtis Byers  22:31
With both deficits. Now, if you take a lexicon and look at these two words, you'll see that there's a lot of overlap, that there's the some of the definitions for one of the words exactly the same to the gift or the other. But what's unique with each is that the heart refers to the mind, it refers to was mental faculties, the place where decisions are made, that would be the unique ideal that's suggested by the heart. And the uniques ideas suggested with the soul that was that word soul is the word nephesh. Right? Where God breathed into them the breath of life, that's nephesh of life. Right? So the breath, the whole being some would express it refers to the whole person, not just the mind, but the whole person has to be involved as well. Now, think about that for a second and look at that list. God wanted Israel to know that whether you serve him or you turned to him or you obey Him, or you keep His commandments, it's more than just an act of a mind. It's more than just that, that knowledge and that recognition that God has this expectation. There has to be a whole body to cooperate in doing it. Take repentance, for example. What would it mean to repent with one's whole heart and with all their soul? Well, first, it would mean that you have to understand that you've sinned against God. That's the mind right? You understand that you've sinned against God. And you have made the decision. That's the mind you've made the decision to turn repentance, their turn away from God. But is that simply good enough? No, because you have to have a whole been in a to them over Jesus over in Matthew five. He said, If your right hand offends you, that is because as you to see him and then cut it off. That's my left hand. I'm sorry. If your right eye offends you or cause you to sin, then pluck it out. He said it's better to enter to live without that hand. Without that. I there'll be a password in the castle to hail with them both still intact, right? If the head or the eye is part of the problem, they're part of that whole being that whole person and we have to get rid of it. Our whole person or have been, has to be part of the repentance that we have said that we need to do and that we have decided to do. But we must do it and get rid of everything else. Right? Do you see the point. And the same thing is true of how we love God, and how we serve God and how we keep his commandments, and so forth. All those, all those things have to be tied together with both our heart and our soul. But there's one more word that he uses. And that is the word might. And this is a interesting word is a common word but it's, but it's not used as a noun, except for in this location is always used as a verb, or that seems that an adverb or a perhaps an adjective. There's a modifier. And normally it is translated very, or exceedingly, right. But they've taken that word which is normally an adverb, and they've made it a noun. Well, I don't, I don't, we don't have a noun, you know, form of that ever, what would be the noun Verily, I don't know. I'm called Verlin. Right? So say Verlin. That's the noun form. And so with all your heart with all your soul, with all your violin, excuse me, I just can't think of anything else. All your Verily, that's what you're to use. Now, this translation might, comes from the Septuagint. You know, when the, when they translate it the Hebrew Scriptures into Greek, and they saw this word, and they go, this is this is unusual. This is the only time this word ever occurs like this. And they had to make a decision as to what it meant. Well, the Greek word they used was the word might, or strength. So that's why it shows up in our translations that way. Because they thought it referred to the energy, right? Your strength has to do with the intensity of your obedience, the intensity of your love, see the difference? Your heart and your person, you can do all you can, you can dedicate all that to the Lord. But there's there's other thing you've got to do, too. You've got to give it with all your intensity with all your might, with all your strength, with all your effort. There's no nothing can be held back. Do you see the point? Now, the Jews,

Curtis Byers  27:34
when they looked at that word, and their targums, the target is where their commentaries, when they looked at that word in their commentaries, they put the word wealth there. An ideal is in serving God with all our heart and our soul, and also with all our wealth, or all our resources. Well, that's certainly true, too, right? That's certainly something that we have to do as well. If we're going to give our whole person that includes the things that we have, and so either thought would be an appropriately appropriate thought, would be a good thought. All right, for us to understand.

Curtis Byers  28:19
But I would like but I'm going to focus upon the sentence with the word might or scrape. I think it seems to me that that's a better sentence. Because that does seem to me to have something to do with the intensity of one's effort. In fact, that's that's not uncommon in Scripture, right? Colossians three, verse 23. Paul says, Whatever you do, work heartily, okay. For as for the Lord and not for men, there is not talking about the mind. He's talking about the effort that we put in work hardly is for the Lord. A second Timothy two, verse 15. Paul says to Timothy, do your best to present yourself to God, don't just do it halfway, do your best. And Ecclesiastes, writer verse, chapter nine, verse 10, said, whatever your hand finds to do, do it with all your might. That's an important part of this command. When we are to love God, and also the cost by extension loving neighbor, we do with all our understanding, we deal with our whole being, that we also deal with all our mind. Nothing is to be held back. In fact, we probably should note that other word in this text, the word all, that word is a very powerful word. Because not just with our heart or mind or soul or soul in our screens, it's all our heart, and all our soul and all our mind. 100 percent total, complete, without fail, the the full of the entire everything is to be included, when we are to love God all you know Israel failed miserably in this. They built the temple, the temple was to be God's dwelling place. And they were to go up to the temple and worship God there because that's where God was. The winner is visualize, saw the gods round about them, they did the very thing that God and Moses had warned them not to do. They started to serve those gods as well. And you know, they would actually take bale idols, those stone idols, and they would take those would idols the ash ring, and they would take them and put those idols in the tipple. And say, Well, we've come to worship Jehovah, but we're going to worship these gods as well. Right? But God says, You can't do that. You know, he expects our wholehearted are all our heart, all our soul and all our screens. We can't give some of it to God and some of it to someone else. That's and because of that God destroyed. Now the Jews learned that lesson. And when you come to the New Testament, we never read about the Jews ever worshipping another idol. They there's they have totally gotten out of their system that seems the idea of worshipping the bale or the ash regime, or even the gods of Rome, or the gods of the Greeks. They didn't do that. But did that mean that this isn't never no longer this this command to love God with all our being? Does that go away? No, because Jesus did say, live the 16th chapter, that No servant can serve two masters for either he will hate the one and love the other or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other one cannot serve God and money. There are other idols we can put into place of bail or putting the place of ashrams and put alongside God, whether it's the god of money, or is the god of power, the god of unless senseless life, or the God of whatever else we might desire. Anything that we put aside God, that would take even us even a half of 1% of our heart, or mind or soul is not acceptable God, he doesn't want 99.9% He was 100% of our lives and what would it look like? For a person to love God? with all their heart is all their soul? When all this means what what would that look like? I want to read if you were turned to second teams, the 23rd chapter. This is a lengthy reading, but I'm gonna read this make a couple comments and then the lesson will be yours. This tells us about King Josiah.

Curtis Byers  33:23
This is about 400 years after David rule. And David was kind of the model for the kings of Judah when the king of Judah did right. Is said that they walked in the ways of their father David. When they didn't do Ryder says that they didn't walk in the ways of their father David walked out in the ways of the gods round about. And Judah had a few good kings. But because of Manasseh who was who was Josiah his granddad, no. Dad, is that right? Why is his granddad or dad? Was that grandfather? Thank you, God blank. You know, I'm sorry, I can't remember everything. Because of Manasseh The Lord said, God said that he was going to destroy this role. Now Josiah comes along and God delays that judgment. But he doesn't do away with it. But just put any delay to because Josiah serving well. So I want to read and remember Josiah. He was eight years old when he began to reign as a king was young boys a king. But what does it say that he did when he was 16 years old and eighth year of his reign? It says they're in verse. Romans were actually we were told us in Chronicles, not in Kings, that at the age of 16, he began to seek the God of David and the Chronicle Ryder also tells us that when he returned, when he, he began to purge Judah and Jerusalem of the high places 16 years old, he decided to follow the lower that's about the age of some of our young people here. By the time you're driving a car by yourself, at that age, he decided he was going to fall lowered. And by the age of 20, he was old enough, he could do something about it. In terms of idolatry, he began to purge the idle places. That was less read in verse, beginning of verse one of chapter 23. Please follow along with me if you can can. Then the king sin and all the elders of Judah and Jerusalem together to him and the king went up to the house of the Lord, and with him all the energy and all the habits of Jerusalem and the priests and the prophets. All the people both small and great. And he read and they're here, this is Josiah reading, right? And he read and they're hearing all the words of the book of the covenant. They've been found in the house of the Lord, and the Kingston bye by the pillar, and made a covenant before the Lord, to walk after the Lord to keep the commandments in his testimonies in his statues, with all his heart and soul to perform the words this covenant that are written in this book, and all the people joined in the covenant.

Curtis Byers  36:31
And he commanded Hilkiah, the high priests and the priests of the second order, and the keepers of the threshold to bring out of the temple of the Lord all of the vessels made for bail for Ashra for all the hosts of heaven. He burned them outside Reuzel in the fields of Kidron and carry their to ashes to Bethel. And he deposed the priests from the kings of Judah had ordained to make offerings in the hot places that disease drew up and around Islam. those also who burned infested bail into the sun and the moon and the constellations and all the hosts his heavens, and he any brought out the Astra from the house of the Lord outside Jerusalem to the book Cringer him and burn it in the book brook Kidron, and Barrett beat it to dust and cast the dust upon the graves of the common people. And he broke down the houses of the mill cut caught, excuse me, the milk called prostitutes who were in the House of Lords where the women wove hangings for the ashram. And he brought all of the priests out of the cities of Judah and a fall to hop places with a priests had made offerings from from jiba. To bear Shiva, a broke down to high places of the gates, and that were at the entrance of the gate of Joshua, the governor of the city, which were on ones left at the gate of the city. And however, the priests of the high prices did not come up to the altar, other Lord drew Islam but they are, they are unleavened bread among their brothers, and he defile. Tofa wishes to devalue the son of Hinnom that will no one might burn his son or daughter as an offering to Molek. And he removed the horses that the kingdom of Judah had dedicated to the sun at the interest of the house of the Lord, but the chamber and Nathan Molech the chamberlain, which was in the precincts, and he burned the chariots of the sun with fire. And the authors of the roof up on the roof of the upper chamber of Ahaz was the kings of Judah hadn't made and the authors have been NASA had made the two cores of the house of Lord He pulled down and broken pieces and cast the dust with them in the brook kinderen. And they came to file to high places that were in East Jerusalem to the south, of the amount of corruption with Solomon, the king of Israel have built for Ashcroft and the abomination this I don't Ian's, if we're CI Marsh, the abomination of Moab and for milking them abomination of the Lamanites a broken pieces, the pillars and cut down the ash ring and fill their places with the bones of men. Moreover, the altar at Bethel, the hot place erected by Jeroboam, the son of knee bat, who made Israel to see in that altar with a hot place, he pulled down and burned, reducing it to dust. He also burned the Ashra. And as Josiah turned, he saw the tombs there on the Mount. He said and took the bones out of the tombs and burned them on the altar and defiled it, according to the Word of the Lord, that the man of God proclaimed to have predicted these things. Then he said, What is that monument that I see? And the men of the city told him? What is the tomb of the man of God who came from Judah? It predicted these things that you have done against the altar at Bethel. And he said, let him be let no man move his bones. So they've had his bones alone, with the bones of the prophets who came out of Sumerian. And Josiah removed all the shrines also have the high places that were in the cities. The scenario was kings of Israel had made provoking the Lord anger he did them according to all that he had done at Bethel. And he sacrificed all The priests of the high places who were there on the altars, and burned human bones on them. Then he returned to Jerusalem. And a cane commanded all the people keep the Passover to the Lord your God as it is written in the book of the covenant. For no such Passover has been kept since the days the judges who judged Israel, or during all the days of the king of Israel, are the kings of Judah. But in the 18th year of King Josiah, this Passover was kept to the Lord in Jerusalem. Moreover, Josiah put away all the mediums in the necromancers, and the household gods and idols and all the abominations that we're seeing in the land of Judah and Jerusalem, that he might establish the words of the law that were written in the book that Hilkiah the priests found in the house of the Lord. Bye by reading this. Look at verse 25. Beforehand, there was no king like him who turned to the Lord, with all his heart, and with all his soul, with all his might be according to all the law, Moses, nor to any like him, nor did any like him arise after him. Of all the great people, the scriptures, good and godly men and women.

Curtis Byers  41:28
Only Josiah is a set of that he followed the lowered with all his heart, with all his soul with all your screens. He was 26 years old, when he got back in offer that Passover. So he did apparently all these things that we read, removing all these gods from the time of Jeroboam up to that day, that appear for 28 is what he is 20 to 26 years old. What do you think he thought, when he got up in the morning? And he was going to do today? What do you think that he was thinking when he went to bed at night? Surely he was thinking, how can I serve the Lord? How can I love him with all my heart, my soul and my strength? Have we? Has there been one year or in our life, that we could say that was true of that year? Has there been one month in our life where we can say it was true of that month? Has there been a day in our life, where we to say that that day, I serve the Lord with all my heart with all my soul from a strength. The Lord doesn't want a day. He doesn't want a month, he doesn't want a year he was our entire lives. I have failed. I've not done that. And I suspect others may feel the same. The Lord knows that we we have obligations. And he's not expecting us to be a monk. In fact, I think he doesn't. I think that's the very last thing he wants to do. Because he wants us to be a light. He doesn't want to put our light under a bushel. But in whatever circumstance we find ourselves as we walk along the way as we teach our you know, whether we're walking or working, or whatever we're doing, we we do the things that we do, out of love for the Lord with our whole heart, our whole soul, and our whole screens. And we teach our children that it's as if you know, as if when the Lord took a big pin and put a marker there from Deuteronomy, chapter six, and brought it over here to Second Kings 23 and said, You want to know what it is to love me with all your hearts. Look, look at Josiah and then you'll understand. So I would submit let's look at Josiah in do the things that he did with the same fervency of spirit with all our might serve the Lord, the president here this morning who are subjected to imitation anyway we would love to be of benefit to you to be of assistance to you and whatever we might can do. We can if we can be of assistance please come as we say I say
