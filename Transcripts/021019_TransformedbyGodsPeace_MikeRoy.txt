It is always such a privilege to come and worship God to honor Him, to praise Him are the highest responsibility in every human heart is to know God, to love Him and to obey Him. So we have come to do that this morning, especially to remember the great sacrifice that Jesus made on our behalf, we must never take that for granted or or forget what Jesus has has done on our behalf. Appreciate the songs that Jesse led this morning as we focus on a message that, in my experience, I just don't seem to preach very often on the subject of peace. I was thinking about that recently. And though, like many of us might talk about peace, and in think about that, but to actually take a text of Scripture, where that's kind of the focus of the, the the text, I haven't really done that, as I've looked back over some lessons. And so I'm going to do that this morning. And take a look at a very familiar text of Scripture in Philippians chapter four, and kind of zero in on a message that I think that we have maybe have largely overlooked in some ways. Last week, Conrad mentioned that the real impact of being raised up with Christ, which is our theme for this year, is that of transformation. So if we're raised up with Christ, that means we were changed and so many essential ways. We saw that clearly and again, his lesson last week in the conversion and life of the apostle Paul, Paul was a transformed man. In a similar vein, I want to suggest to us that God's peace has a transforming effect upon each of us. Again, I'm afraid that for different reasons, we have missed some of the messages that relate to God's peace that God wants us to have in our own lives. And so this morning, we'll be looking at flipping and chapter four, verses four through seven. And I've titled My lesson transformed by God's peace. And so here's again, as it will be, if you have your Bibles open, you might want to turn there to Philippians chapter four, I'm going to put this on the screen as well. But one of the messages that comes from that is that we lived transformed lives, we're not, but we should not be controlled by worry and fear and doubt and uncertainty and anxiety that so often characterizes our minds in our lives. But this text, if there's a message that is shouting to us, this at least is one of the the dominant messages that we are chained, we are transformed by God's peace. So let's look at that this morning. Is we look at a text that again, we are, I'm sure quite familiar with. But very often, having noticed what Paul is saying over here, so on a screen, you'll notice and this is my kind of favorite type of preaching just to take a text of Scripture, and then just camp here at the text in mind what God is saying to us, often we can look at scriptures all over which is we need to do that to get a balance in scripture. But we just want to kind of camp on this text and say, what what is God saying to me today? What is God saying to you today? Through this text, so flipping is chapter four.

Mike Roy  03:29
And verse four, Paul says, Rejoice in the Lord always again, I will say rejoice. Let your gentle spirit be known to all men, the Lord is near, Be anxious for nothing, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God, and the peace of God. The peace of God which surpasses all comprehension, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus. So just to get the context here, of course, we remind ourselves that Paul's writing from prison, and yet his his his mind is filled with joy, and thankfulness that he has as a Christian, having his sins forgiven, having been baptized into Christ. And so what you see here, especially in verse four, the power of joy in a Christians life and a man or woman in his or her head in heart, and one of the points that I make make here when Paul says, Rejoice in the Lord always. Again, I will say rejoice. Sometimes we might find it hard to rejoice when we're dealing with sickness or the loss of loved one. That happens to all of us at different times. And some we face financial challenges and health issues and job issues and all types of things. But the point that Paul's making here is as a Christian, I can rejoice always, always in God it, no matter what's going on, I've got my name written in the Lamb's book of life, that's a pretty good place to pretty good role to be in to have the HOPE of eternal life. And so Paul is saying that, that there's always a reason to rejoice in the Lord, even when we're facing great difficulty. Sometimes we sing this song, the joy of the Lord will be your strength. And that's true. The joy of serving God is what empowers us to do God's will. So again, in the context, Paul begins by talking about rejoicing. And verse five very quickly said, Let your gentle spirit be known to all men. The ESP says, Let your reasonable Miss be known to everyone. And so in the context of our struggles, and maybe teaching others and trying to correct religious error, and bringing losses to the truth, as we seek to change people's lives and impact them, we've got to be gentle as we point out their errors, or as I share my errors and weaknesses with with somebody else. And so I think that's what he's saying here. That as Christians, we're filled with the joy of serving God, that we want to be gentle with others, you want to be patient with them. Yes, we need to deal with sin. Yes, we need to deal with faulty false teaching. But in that process, he said, let this is an American Standard, let your gentle spirit be known to all men. And he said, The Lord is near, that could refer to maybe the imminent return of Christ in judgment against Jerusalem, because because of the sins of the Jewish people in general, or he may be talking about the fact that, that God's got this God's judgment is coming, and people are going to give an account to him for that. So we don't have to. We don't have to roughhouse people and shake them up and be harsh with them. And try as we live out our life, we can be gentle with them, understanding that God is the one who was the final judge, and we point people to him, but I want us to, excuse me focus our attention this morning, especially on verses six and seven. And again, we don't often at least I don't in looking at this text, I don't often focus on the peace of God, which is really the focus of this context right here. So we raised the question, what is the peace of God? How do we experience that? How do we achieve that, I want you to notice a couple of things. And really what I want to suggest in this text, it will go back to this back to this text just a second, that I think that Paul is, is issuing to us a make a paradigm shift. What he's saying is not anxiety, not worrying, not fear, but peace. So if you want to write that down in your notebook, in your iPad, or in your mind, that's where he was, he was saying, Oh, here. So in this context, he's saying, Not anxiety, not fear, but peace. So go back to the text over here. In verse six, he says, Be anxious for nothing, right? And then he talks about the need for prayer, we'll go into that as we go through this text. You said the anxious for nothing but what he's saying in verse seven. And the peace of God will guard your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus. So that's the that's why when I suggest this to us this morning, there's a major paradigm shift that Paul is trying to give each one of us, not anxiety, but the peace of God. And I'm not just saying, Well, how do I achieve that? Well, we'll talk about that here as we get into the lesson to smart but that's what he's saying. Not anxiety, not worry, not fear, but peace. And yet, when we struggle with fear and anxiety, then we're not we're not living out really God's desire in terms of having the peace that he wants to, to surround our lives. And so you look at you look at this text over here and again, it's a challenge for us to to ask you to make a big paradigm shift. So again, it's not peace, but

Mike Roy  09:06
but God wants us not worried but God wants to to have peace. And so let's as we go through this text, just raise some some basic questions. What is the peace of God? We're looking at this text, and Paulson Be anxious for nothing. but in everything by prayer and thanksgiving, are supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God and the peace of God. What is the peace of God? Good question. Well, I want to suggest, first of all, that it is the peace that comes from God. So God gives us peace, He gives us peace of mind gives us peace. It releases us from the fear of sin and the guilt of sin, the consequence of sin. So, so the peace of God is something that he gives us. But another element of this word is that the peace of God is the very peace that God Himself has, within his own care. If you're within the Godhead, and so when Paul says that, and the peace of God which surpasses all comprehension, will guard your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus, he's talking about the peace that God Himself has. My question is, how much worry and anxiety and fear does God wrestled with? He doesn't. He doesn't, He's God. He's got control of homework, how much worry and anxiety and fear should we wrestle with what we shouldn't, because God's will for us is to give that to him to cast that man upon Him, and He will bring, he will give that to us. And so think about it. And this term, that the peace of God is the very piece that he possesses himself, and think about the God had God the Father, God, the Son, God, the Holy Spirit, this absolutely perfect relationship, but peace, that is that they experienced together. And again, that's that's what he offers to each one of us. So when we think about this as a promise in the peace of God is going to guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus. We'll get to that later into the lesson. So we're talking about the very piece that God Himself possesses so many times in Scripture. In Jesus in John chapter 14, we were thinking this morning with him as he was getting ready to leave this world when he tells his disciples in John 1427, he says, Peace I leave with you, my peace, my peace I give to you not as the world gives do I give to you, do not let your heart be troubled, nor let it be fearful yet human nature's is such that we know that our hearts are often troubled, and often fearful. But what Jesus says to His disciples before he leaves them, he said, I'm gonna leave you with peace. And he said, in fact, my peace, I give you what God wants you to have and meet to have, is the peace that he has within the Godhead. And I think we, the reality is, we have to learn how to achieve that. It's not something that just becomes automatic. And John, chapter 16, verse 33, again, similar message, it says, These things I have spoken to you, so that in me, you may have peace in the world you have tribulation, but take courage, I have overcome the world. So the source of our peace is found in a relationship with Jesus Christ. And that, of course, first means that we we obeyed the gospel of Christ through faith and repentance and confessing that faith before man, and submitting to God's command to be immersed in water. That's how we are united with Christ. But what Jesus says, in this again, promise, I've spoken these things to you, so that in me or in union with Me, you may have peace. That's his goal. That's his desire for each one of us. You look also in John chapter 20, this is following his resurrection. What's the message that he gets to decide they're, they're nervous, maybe they're anxious, they're troubled, but they're there their Lord and Savior,

Mike Roy  13:13
and uncertain about the future says on the evening of that day, the first day of the week, the doors being locked with the disciples were for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood among them and said to them, Peace, be with me says, message peace, be with you, I want you guys to be have hearts filled with peace, you carry out my mission. When he had said this, he showed them his hands in his side, then the disciples were glad when they saw the Lord. And Jesus said to them, again, Peace be with you. So is it important to God that that we his children are surrounded by peace and experiences peace? Surely, it is important, he understands the challenge for us being experiencing that level of peace because we live in a world with sin and trial and uncertainty. And our human emotions sometimes overwhelm us. And we find ourselves not having that kind of peace that Jesus wants us to have. But again, you look at this text over here, in Philippians, chapter four, this is this is what Paul is praying for. Paul wants fellow Christians to have the peace of God. And in some ways, we say, well, if, if, if, generally speaking, we as Christians don't really experience that piece. Obviously, it may be a lack of trust in our part, but what does that say? If we think about God, God doesn't want us to be filled with worry, and fear and anxiety. And so obviously, we need to learn to trust him more trust, his love, trust, his grace, all of that. So you look at the text over here, and clearly that the peace that God offers to us is a powerful it's a it's a transforming peace. He's, and I want you to think about this too when you look at the context over here. And in verse seven, it says in the peace of God, which surpasses all comprehension, so you think about this raises the question, what is the scope, or the measure of God's peace, while the New American Standard Version says that it surpasses all comprehension? The ESP said that surpasses all understanding what is that saying over here, the peace of God is so powerful and so pervasive that no human mind can even fathom the depth of it. That's amazing. And maybe we'll spend our lives trying to figure out and how to access this, this wonderful gift that God has given us. But that's what he's saying. That the peace of God, that's what we're talking about the peace that he has himself that he wants to surround our lives with. That piece is so powerful that we, it said, even human, the human mind, the human brain cannot even comprehend the magnitude of that piece, our response to because trust, trust God, even even more than we do. So again, we looking looking at this text this morning. And this is the big question. It's always this way. We talk about things about God's love and God's peace. We believe that we say I want it Mike, I want to test you to sign me up. I want to have the peace of God there a peace that God has, in his own character, I want that how do we achieve this peace? While you look, again, at the text over here, you said Be anxious for nothing but in everything by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving. So these are the three keys to achieving in the peace of God will talk about that similar prayer, supplication and thanksgiving. But there's one important thing that I didn't highlight at this point I want you to think about in verse six, to Luke kind of little words, that we kind of read past he said that by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, and everything,

Mike Roy  17:11
in not just a few things. So mighty means I can have, I can pray to God and, and put my supplication before him, and be thankful and find this peace, even when I'm dealing with serious health issues, or financial burdens, or the loss of a loved one, a child or parent. Yes, and everything God knows, God knows what's going on in your life and in my life. And so that's the point that Paul's making you Be anxious for nothing. So there's some superlatives Be anxious for nothing, but in everything, by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving. So that's the point that we make over here is that God wants us to give him everything. The point I make here is if your worry or my worries, are weighing me down, and there's something bothering me whether it's a little thing, give it to God, that's really saying everything, sometimes I don't want to burden God with concern about my job, or I don't concern God with you know, issues about my physical health, or my my faith or my lack, you know, that's the point that he says in everything. Give that to God. And so what he's telling us to do, then, to have this piece is we, we go to God in prayer, we offer our supplications. And then we offer him our Thanksgiving. So these are again, just three of the keys that we can practice that will help us achieve the peace of mind that God is, is is promising to us. So prayer, we sang that song this morning, air you left the room this morning, did you think to pray, there's another song that we sing I forget the name of it. Oh, what peace we often forfeit? Oh, what needless pain we bear. All because we do not carry everything to God and prayer. So there's a powerful tool that's the most one of the most powerful tools and in the world, that at anytime, day or night, in your room and your vehicle, wherever it may be. You can pray to the God of heaven and earth and he bends his ear to listen to you. Amazing. But so I say well, I do pray Mike, I do too. But sometimes we still can struggle with anxiety or worry or uncertainty. The next thing he talks about their supplication, this is a stronger term. So so we give God our concerns. We pray to Him. Then we offer the supplication. So supplication is a stronger term for prayer. Think about Jesus in our text this morning. Here he is praying to His father, he's going to burden you've got the weight of the whole world. Hold on his shoulders, and he falls on his face before the ground. You Father, if it is possible at this cup pass from me. So Jesus is basically in treating his father with these intense supplications I think the book of Hebrews mentions that he was heard because of his loud groanings. So Jesus poured his heart out in prayer to God, he entreated his father, and again, he was engaging in supplication. And so it's a more intense form of prayer. And so again, and I think that we realized that prayer engage, to engage in meaningful prayer is not an easy thing to do. What happens so even so, so often when we try to do that our minds are already racing with work activities, or family issues, or travel or health issues. And so we're to try to pray what happens, all of a sudden, our mind starts to wander, we're thinking about something. So it's it requires a real level of discipline. The other thing, that another key to achieving the peace of God, kind of surprising in some ways. That's the third thing appears Thanksgiving. Because So oftentimes, we're thinking, I can't be thankful because my life is not perfect. Guess what? Nobody's life is perfect. We're on our way to a place of complete perfection. But again, to be thankful to God for all that He has given to us. Paul says this in Colossians chapter three. And

Mike Roy  21:39
he said, Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts to which you indeed were called in one body and be thankful. So the first thing I want to mention while we talk about this, so looking at the question, how do we achieve this piece of a how do we receive God's peace? Well, in verse 15, he says, Let the peace of Christ rule in your heart that word rule could really means to act as an arbiter. So what that means is when these flood of thoughts come into my mind, it could be stress and strain and worry and fear and all these things. assault me, what I do in my heart of what we should do in our hearts is our heart. arbitrate says that, no, I'm a child of God, I'm not gonna go down that road. So the reality I want to be real and relevant in this anxiety and worry, and fear, is there a common thread for all of us. But it's also a choice. We choose to say no to the devil, you know, who was trying to pin you down who was trying to discourage us and say, You can't do this, this is too difficult. It's the devil. He's trying to bring us down. And so Paul says, you let your heart rule in the matter like a judge does, okay? weigh the evidence. Satan is assaulting me as a worthless person. I'm not a good Christian, I'm not strong. I'm weak in this area. And I say, you know, the blood of Christ cleanses me from all sin. So let your heart act as the arbiter and say it will, it'll bring that peace that God wants us to have. So again, this is a verse that that relates to the issue of how we achieve the peace that God wants to to have. So again, in verse 15, Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts to wish Indeed you are called in one body, and be thankful. Be thankful. It's so easy not to be thankful. So many things on our wish list. I wish I had this, and this and this, and this and all this other stuff. And I lived here and had this job. And we have this unrealistic wish list, but Paul is telling us over here, that we need to be thankful. Then he says, Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly with all wisdom, we get McGlasson straight over here. Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly, teaching admonishing one another in all wisdom, singing psalms, and hymns and spiritual songs. with thankfulness in your hearts to God, and whatever you do, in word or deed, do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus giving thanks to God the Father through him so, so powerful truth right here, in addition to the prayer and supplication, you want greater peace, you want the peace of God that feel your heart. Be thankful, I know your life is imperfect. I know you might deal with loneliness, and uncertainty and all that stuff or maybe difficult people in your life. But be thankful for God's love, His mercy and His grace. It's a powerful way of liberating us sometimes from the lies of Satan. So Colossians chapter three reminds us in terms of the keys that we're looking at in Philippians chapter three, the three keys, prayer, supplication, and again, that's just not casual prayer. There's fervent prayer like Jesus was engaged in when he had his face on the dirt in the ground, pouring his heart out to God. And then this this idea of a thing of thanksgiving. So, so Paul is reminding us of the things that we have to do in order to achieve this peace of mind. And so the question I also want us to notice from this text is, what is the impact? What is the impact of God's peace on us again, go back to the text in Philippians chapter four. And sometimes if we focus on the reward of the benefit that will motivate us to work harder, in terms of prayer and supplication and Thanksgiving that type of thing is in verse seven, following you know, the verse six we said, the anxious for nothing but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God and the peace of God which surpasses all comprehension, will guard your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus, I want you to think about that for just a moment. So

Mike Roy  26:07
he says that when we pray to God, and we implore Him to supplication, the peace of God will guard our hearts and our minds in Christ Jesus again, here's a powerful truth that we need to first believe and then implement that in our life. So this word guard is a military term. So you think about a a castle, or some building or camp being guarded have these 50 foot walls you know, a think about a fortified city, so that the the castle is protected from enemy intrusion by this massive wall, and the spears can't get in there. And the cannon balls can't get over it, and can't go through it, and the flaming darts hit it and fall into the moat below it. So what he's saying here is that the peace of God acts as fortified wall around your heart and mind, it doesn't let the enemy get into our minds with the ever present struggles of worry and uncertainty and doubt and fear and all that kind of stuff. So that's, that's the promise of God. And the reality is, we have to be diligent in our lives to spend time in prayer with God, and be proactive when Tao says sale us when thoughts a sale our minds, we we've got to realize we were stronger than that. So that's the promise that these the peace of God will guard our hearts and minds. And it's a deep subject when we talk about emotional well being and mental health. And in the reality we all struggle to some degree with these issues. But if we don't take an aggressive, intentional stance against the assault of Satan, we can find ourselves crippled with fear and doubt, and anxiety in our lives. That's not what God wants. But in some ways, there are some simple things that we need to do. We need to pray to God, we'd need to implore Him with fervent prayer, and certainly be thankful. But the act of worship that we engage in this morning that's transforming itself as we come to God and worship Him. So again, this morning, just because I was looking at this opportunity to preach this morning over the last week or so this text kind of hit me. And again, we don't really talk about the peace of God. But this is a powerful promise that God is giving to us. I hope as we'll think about that, wait, God is what God wants for us. Is the very piece that he himself has, is he asked what I want in the reality you know, we're in a battle with it. That's something that we need to remind ourselves of Satan's out there trying to bring us down we got to take the shield of faith we've got to take the helmet of salvation and we got to be prepared a feast news you have to six shows a Christian is a person who is battle ready. We don't turn our back on Satan because we turn our back on Satan gonna kill us. And so it's a reminder for us to to move forward. And so as we wrap up the lesson this morning, he raised that question, do you have the peace of God? Course peace with God comes about when we obey the gospel turn from a life of sin. express our faith in Jesus as Messiah confessed that faith before men, and then submit the Gods command to be immersed in water to have our sins forgiven. That's how you achieve peace with God. The reality is if you say this, if you haven't done that this morning, you need to do that if you want real lasting peace. You can't find that anywhere else. And I think that's one of the the the emphases of the text is that the peace that surpasses understanding, peace People can live in this world and pursue drugs or some type of alcohol and a way to find some kind of peace of mind. It can't be found except on God's terms. So we get peace with God, when we obey his will. And then the other reality is as Christians, we can still struggle and I can still struggle with worry and doubt and anxiety, but we can overcome those things. By by intentional living if you're here this morning in heaven obeyed the gospel of Christ, we encourage you to do so if you need the praise of this congregation. For the struggles that you might face in your life. We invite you to come forward while we stand and sing this invitation song
