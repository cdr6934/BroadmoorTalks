I say it often but it's always such a privilege to worship our great in awesome God appreciate the songs that we've sung this morning appreciate the prayers this morning, reminding us that we are all in this journey together. As we trust God's grace for the child, the face appreciate that last song derby. I didn't know that one, but very compelling words in there. And they will certainly complement my message this morning. So we are here, as we've said repeatedly this morning to praise God to honor Him to give him the praise that he is due to thank him for his matchless grace and to strive to become more like Him. In our character. Throughout Scripture, God has given his people given us many invitations, and very in various ways. And this morning, I want to turn our attention to Hebrews chapter four. They're looking at that recently. And I want to suggest to you that God has given us just in this one chapter, we could look at a lot of other verses in the Bible, for great invitations or exhortation that God gives each one of us, especially those of us who are His children, to serve Him. So there are four great invitations that are set before us. We're gonna look at those this morning, and make some applications to our lives as we seek to trust God, to bring us home safely to eternal glory, it's a struggle, it's a challenge, we all face it, every single one of us, one of the phrases I say in my mind quite a bit. So we need to think about the Lord's church, more as a hospital for sinners, rather than a hotel for saints. We get all dressed up nice pause my shoes. Now I don't really polish my shoes, but I should. But you know, we we can't we put on a happy face. And we want to be encouraging but we have pain and suffering and shortcomings and difficulties in fear of failures and fears in our lives. And God wants us to trust Him through that journey. And we certainly draw encouragement from one another so that the, the period of worship that we are engaging in which we do on a regular basis, is a great source of encouragement to me is all of us, do our best to put God's will first in our lives. But I want us to focus this morning on this text, if you've got your Bibles open there, your iPad, whatever you use, to look at these invitations that God has given to us by way of exhortation and encouragement. And very quickly, let me show you these and we'll look at the text. So this again, we're just looking at one chapter in the book of Hebrews chapter four, the invitation is to let us fear let us be diligent, let us hold fast, and let us come boldly. So those are some abbreviated statements from the book of Hebrews. We'll look at those in detail. But these are for invitations for exhortations that God gives each one of us let us fear. Let us be diligent, let us hold tightly to what we believe let us come boldly to the throne of grace. So the first point I want us to make is we'll look at this text this morning. In Hebrews chapter four, the writer is telling us that we need to have a healthy fear of God, to empower us to serve God faithfully so that we will enter that rest at promise res look at verses one through seven.

Mike Roy  03:24
of Hebrews chapter four. The writer says Therefore, let us fear if while the promise remains of entering his rest, any one of you may seem to have come short of it. For indeed we have had good news preached to us just as they did also. But the word they did the word they heard did not profit them, because it was not united with faith in those who heard, for we who have believed enter that rest justice he has said, as I swore in my wrath, they shall not enter my rest, although his works were finished from the foundation of the world. For he has said some work concerning the seventh day, and God rested on the seventh day from all his works. And again, in this passage, they shall not enter my rest, therefore, since it remains for some to enter it, and those who formerly had good news preached them failed to enter because of disobedience. He again fixes a certain day today, saying through David after so long a time, after so long a time, just as has been said before today, if you hear His voice, do not harden your hearts, I'm reading from the New American Standard Version. The SP is a little bit different, but conveys the same meaning there. But what he's saying over here that God had given a Sabbath rest a promise of rest for his people in the Old Testament. And by and large, those people rejected that they didn't enter his rest because of this belief. But what the Hebrew writer is saying is that the promise of entering the real rest of final rest still stands today. Even though many stumbled because of unbelief and disbelief and unfaithfulness. That promise is still Feel outstanding for you and for me to enter that rest. And so the message here, that the writer is telling us, let us tremble in fear before God, so that we do not stumble in unbelief like Israel did. The Israelites receive this promise of God, but they failed to act in faith and obedience. The text is telling us here, that only those who believed God and obey his will, will enter that final rest. So faith is essential obedience is essential. And what the verse seven is showing us and telling us is that God has given another opportunity to enter that rest, that eternal rest. And that opportunity is now today. And that's what he's saying there. In verse seven, that the previously the Israelites had disobeyed God, and many did not enter that rest. That was promised back then. But he's saying today, this, this opportunity is here for us. And but the key that I want to stress the first point that I want to stress to each one of us, if we're going to enter that final rest, and that's the goal of my life to leave my wife, my family, my children, my mom's so many of the other anybody I can, the goal is to enter that final rest, one of the qualities of heart that we have to have, is a wholesome fear of Almighty God, you cannot substitute that. And this is not the terrifying fear, I'm afraid God might punch me there is that element there but to say, it holds some respect of what God is of who God is, his characters there, we prayed this morning. So in terms of what we need for motivation, to be faithful to God, to make sure that we don't come up short and miss the glory of heaven. The writer is telling number one is a wholesome reverence for Almighty God. And this message is taught throughout Scripture. In Proverbs chapter 16, verse six by steadfast love and faithfulness, iniquity is a tone for and by the fear of the Lord, one turns away from evil, know how we will win the battle against evil by fearing God, by reverencing him by hating sin, by the testing the lies of the devil. And so, this, this message again, is repeated throughout Scripture, by the fear of the Lord. That's how we stay on the straight and narrow path, that we're not going to be duped by the lies of Satan. After the giving of the of the 10 commandments and verse 20, Moses said to the people, do not be afraid for God who has come in order to test you, in order that the fear of Him may remain with you. So what was Moses prayer for His people, His wish for God's people, the Israelites who were given the promise of entering that land of rest, he prayed that he wants the fear of God to remain with them. Why?

Mike Roy  08:06
So that you may not sin. So fearing God is what helps me keep my life from sin. And when I don't have a healthy fear of God, the devil tricks me and I give into sin. And so again, it's a reminder here, as the writer of Hebrews is telling us, that God is giving us this exhortation this invitation, let us, let us fear if while our promise remains of entering his rest, any one of you may have seen may seem to have come short of it. So that's the first invitation, the first exhortation that God gives us in the Book of Hebrews chapter four. Secondly, we'll see again, the same phraseology that is used in this chapter, verse 11, the writer says, Let us be diligent to enter that rest and not fall because of disobedience. So you jump into the text over here. And

Mike Roy  09:05
in verse 11, he said, Therefore, let us be diligent to enter that rest so that no one will fall through following the same example of disobedience. So the second invitation that God gives us a second exhortation is, let us be diligent, one of the keys to living a faithful life and God services to be diligent in our lives. And I think we've got so many Christians here who are diligent in teaching and Linnaeus in worship, and they're the benefits of that are compounded for all of us. But the writer is telling us that we need to be diligent. If we're going to, if we're going to serve God faithfully overcome all of Satan's lies, and not give into false teaching that abounds in our culture. The ESB puts it this way. Let us therefore Strive to enter that rest so that no one may fall by the sun. Same sort of disobedience, these words written for our benefit. And the the tragedy of Israel stumbling in the in the wilderness and all that is written so that we don't do the same thing. How many times do we see Christians turning their back on the promises of God giving up and saying, I'm going back to the world, why there's nothing there in the world for you. The challenge is for us to, to persevere. So in verse 11, there's that that second let us phrase Let us be diligent, Let us strive, let us give diligence to enter that rest, put forth your very best effort, how important is heaven? And being in that final rest? Is there anything more important than that? No. So give it your best effort. If we do that in the gym, if we do that with our infant, financial investments, or whatever it may be, let's certainly do that as relates to the home and heaven. Look at the next couple of verses, but in the same context, that may seem somewhat disconnected from this, this previous statement to be diligent, let us be diligent. In verse 12, the writer says, For the word of God is living and active, and sharper than any two edged sword, and piercing as far as the division of soul and spirit of boy of both joints and marrow, and able to judge the thoughts and intentions of the heart. And there is no creature hidden from His sight. But all things are open and laid bare to the eyes of Him with whom we have to do with with whom we must give an account. And so you look at these verses, I think what these verses are saying in connection with the previous verse is that the real possibility of self deception is so easy if we think I'm okay, I'm living a little senator, my heart, a little deception in my life, a little bit of worldly man. So I can go and have a drink with my business partners, whatever it might be. And God is saying, every thought every intention of your heart is clearly visible through God's eyes. And there's nothing hidden from his side. And so it's a reminder, that, that we need to be diligent as we serve God if we want to be faithful and faithfully arrived at that final rest. And again, this message of diligence is given to us throughout Scripture. And second Peter chapter one verses 1011, the same exact context over here the same message Peter says this. Therefore, brethren, be all the more diligent to make certain about his calling and choosing you. For as long as you practice these things you will never stumble. For in this way, the entrance into the eternal kingdom of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ will be abundantly supplied to you, isn't that we're saying, making it to the final rest. Right? It's going to be something that we can have assurance about being abundantly supplied to us. But the key is, he said, be all the more diligent, we need diligence, I need diligence in my life. And when I don't have it, it shows in various areas of my life. So Peters telling these Christians they've been their chosen, they're part of God's to elected people. Be diligent about now like this language be be all the more diligent to make certain about his calling and choosing you do you know that I know sometimes we are afraid of some phrases that are thrown around in kind of Calvinistic circles. But the truth is, God chose you to be his son or daughter, not because of any anything inherent in your own character, but because of his love, because you fit the mold he had in his mind before the foundation of the world who is going to save people who would, who would submit their lives to Jesus Christ, oh, God looks at you as His elect or chosen person. And because of that, we've got to be, be diligent not to slip in our faith and get caught up in this world around us. So second, Peter, chapter one mentions the need to be diligent, I think of Second Timothy chapter two, in the context of studying God's Word so that we're we, we understand God's word properly, Paul, right, if the Timothy says this, remind him of these things, and solemnly charged him in the presence of God not to wrangle about words, which is useless, and leads to the ruin of hearers. But in verse 15, he said, Be diligent to present yourself approved to God as a workman who does not need to be ashamed, accurately handling the word of truth. So that's the second message here and this is one that we we need to relate to, if we're going to understand God's word correctly, and understand His plan of salvation and how He wants us to worship Him. We have to be diligent about that. We can't be haphazard and casual and say, well doesn't really matter how we worship God, or what what pleases God We need to give real diligence and in that so the second exhortation and he receptive for is to let us be diligent as we seek to enter that final rest as we seek to be faithful to God so that we do not stumble as a result of sin. And, and the the lies of Satan. The third invitation in this chapter that we want to look at, is found in verse 14, where the writer says, Let us hold fast our confession, says Jesus is our Great High Priest. So look at verse 14, with name and, again, the numeric and standard version, the writer says, Therefore,

Mike Roy  15:42
since we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus, the Son of God, let us hold fast our confession. So again, this is the encouragement that we need this as the exhortation for every one of us. He's saying, Let us hold fast to our confession. And what is the reason for that? Why is the writer of Hebrews tell us that we need to hold fast to our confession of faith and our hope, and God is because we have such a great high priest and we can easily forget that from time to time. Think about maybe a contrast here, the Jews, under the old law, they valued I think their high priest, they recognize the importance of what he was doing. But the Jewish High Priest like Aaron, whoever it may be, was beset with weakness. He had to offer sacrifice for his own sins. First, he couldn't remain permanently because he died. The high priest died from time to time and a new one would have to take his place. And these sacrifices couldn't make the worshiper perfect. under the old law, in fact, the Jewish priesthood was passing away and on and on and on, we see the imperfections of the earthly high priest, in spite of all the good that he could do for the people and atone for their sins, he was still flawed, he was still a sinful man. In contrast, his text tells us that Jesus is the perfect high priest, there is nobody like him, he could atone for any and all of my sins, and he does for me and for you, he has passed, not through the veil of a temple or Taberna, he has passed to the very curtain of heaven, he goes into God's presence directly to intercede for you and for me, and Jesus was sinless. In verse 15 verse that follows to when we just read this, he's, the writer says, For we do not have a high priest who cannot sympathize with our weaknesses. But one who has been tempted in all things as we are stopped by there for a second. I'm not sure if we believe that. Do you really believe that Jesus was tempted with anger, lust, pride. text says he was tempted in every way, every way. I have a hard time thinking that could be the case. He was tempted in every way that a human being can be tempted yet. He never sinned. And that's the difference between him and us, we sin we fall short. So he is the perfect high priests, he has been tempted just like you are with fear with cowardice, would want to give up, he knows about that. He lived through it. So the writers hang let us hold fast to our confession, don't give up. Don't quit, don't give out. Don't give in to fear and to failure and everything else. He said whole faster I can to your confession. Why? Because we don't have Aaron as a High Priest, we have Jesus, who is perfect. And He intercedes on our behalf. And so it's reminder to each one of us. I know you have struggles

Mike Roy  19:04
I happen to we all do. Every single one of us. Don't throw in the towel. That's what the writer is saying, Let us hold fast. It's like when you do met that tug of war when you're a kid, and you're trying to hold on to that group, that rope and sometimes it like it's slipping away, hold fast, do not let go of that. And so this is the third exhortation the third invitation that God gives us in just one chapter, Hebrews chapter four. Let us therefore hold tightly to our confession. Why? Because we have the best high priest ever. And he's been there and done that he knows our weaknesses. And he has direct access into God's throne. But there's one other point I want us to look at from this text. The fourth invitation that God gives each one of us this is not just for a few people to pray. Get your Bible class teacher with a strong leader. This is for everybody. Male and female, old and young, anybody and everybody, let us confidently draw near God's throne of grace. What a compelling thought to think about so as the chapter concludes, this is the fourth exhortation, the fourth invitation that God has given his people is in the verse 16, therefore, let us draw near with confidence to the throne of grace, so that we may receive mercy, and find grace to help in time of need. And so this is, to me is a stunning, amazing invitation, that the King of kings, the Lord of lords, a God of all glory, to God, who spoke the world into existence, by the power of His Word, by the snap of his fingers, so to speak. So as you can come into my throne, you think about Esther, in some Old Testament characters in the anxiety coming before the king. God says, you can come into my throne of judgment. No, we didn't. You can come into my throne of justice. No, we did. You can come into my throne of grace. Wow, that's amazing. You stop and think about that. And so we who are sinners content contaminated by the stain of sin, a given grace at the gracious invitation to come into God's holy throne, which is characterized for us by mercy. And in that context, we realize that God gives us what we need mercy and grace. And so think about, again, Jesus as our high priest, he did for us, but we cannot do for ourselves. And even today, he goes before the Father pleading our case on our behalf. And so again, it's just there's no language that we can come up with to describe the magnitude of God's mercy, and His grace. Sometimes we sing the song Amazing grace, how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me. And nothing else we can say, except to praise God for all that he has done. And so think about that. The fourth invitation to fourth exhortation that God gives us an a book of Hebrews, chapter four, just one chapter is the invitation to come before God's very throne. It's a throne of mercy. thrones in this world, and not thrones of mercy, the thrones of judgment and justice and all that type of thing. And what we received, there is our greatest need for forgiveness of our sins. And this one translation says, so that we may receive mercy and grace to help just when we need it the most. And we all we all need that. And so as we look at Hebrews chapter four, this morning, think about these great invitations that God gives to each one of us. That's the invitation to to fear God does he lay his head let us fear let us fear God, yes, we want to love him, we praise him, but we also we fear God and with a wholesome sense. And secondly, we need to diligently enter that rest. Number three, we said, Let us hold fast to our confession. And then the fourth invitation the fourth exhortation from God, let us draw nearer and nearer God's throne of grace, what an incredible invitation from God. And again, just looking at one chapter, many more of these phrases are throughout the book of Hebrews throughout Scripture, but I wanted to just focus on that this morning. So as we extend the invitation this morning, I just want to remind us as the scripture tells us, this text tells us that this invitation to enter that final rest still stands today. If we have struggled to enter it before, you don't have to struggle just we have to make a decision to love God with all of our hearts, mind, soul and strength to believe that Jesus is the Messiah, to be willing to repent of our sins, to acknowledge that sin hurts God and that hurts us. And then be willing to confess our faith before him. And then be willing to unite our lives with Jesus Christ in baptism by immersion, that our sins can be washed away. If you haven't done that this morning. That's the most urgent thing that you can do before you leave this building. If you haven't obeyed the gospel of Christ, we urge you to do so it may be that you need the President's congregation. Again, we're here to pray with you to pray for you to encourage you to accept the invitation from God that still stands so that when his life is over, we can enter that final rest and rejoice with God forevermore. If

Mike Roy  24:44
you need to respond to the gospel in any way. Come while we stand and sing this invitation song
