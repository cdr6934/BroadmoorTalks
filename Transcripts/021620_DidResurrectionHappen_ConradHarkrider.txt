You ought to be opening your Bibles up to First Corinthians chapter 15.

Conrad Harkrider  00:26
There's a question that I've been thinking about recently. And coincidentally, we also talked about it in our Bible class in the back on Wednesday night. And that is the idea of what is the most important thing that you can teach to your children. And maybe another way of saying that is, if you could only teach your kids one thing, what would it be? If they could only remember one lesson from the time that they were in your home? What would you want them? To remember? That's a really hard thing to answer. Because there's a lot of things that we teach our kids. We teach them about how to live, how to get dressed, how to brush their teeth. As they get older, we teach them life skills, driving a car, how to do their laundry. Right now in our house, one of the things that we're working on is manners, please, thank you. I'm sorry, excuse me. And when I were at the dinner table, and one of the girls was she was about two years old, she led out a burp, I think, on accident. And I looked at her and I said, What do you need to say? And she looked up at me and she said, Thank you, dad, dad. At least she was trying manners and respect are important. But if there's one lesson or truth that I want them to remember, above everything else, it is the answer to this question. And that is, did the resurrection actually happen? Is the story about Jesus? Is that a real thing? Is this an event that is based in history? Or is it just something that a group of men made up? Is this just a tale of folklore that a group of people latched on to? Or can we look back and say, with confidence that this actually took place? Did the resurrection actually occur? This year, our theme for 2020 is seeing Jesus. And so I want us to think for a few moments this morning about the idea of Jesus? Is he a person of history? And is the resurrection an event that actually took place? Do we see him as a real person? I hope that you do because the resurrection is not just an important part of being a Christian. It is the bedrock and foundation of our faith. Look with me in First Corinthians, chapter 15, beginning of verse one. First Corinthians 15, beginning in verse one, it says, Moreover, brethren, I declare to you the gospel which I preached to you, which also you received in which you stand, by which also ye are saved, if you hold fast that word which I preached to you unless you believed in vain, For I delivered to you, first of all, that which I also received, that Christ died for our sins, according to the Scriptures, and that He was buried and that he rose again the third day according to the Scriptures, and that he was seen by Sisyphus, then by the 12. After that he was seen by over 500 brethren at once, of whom the greater part remained to the present, but some have fallen asleep. After that, he was seen by James, then by all the apostles. then last of all, he was seen by me also, as by one born out of due time. Paul says, in verse three, that he delivered to them of First of all, that which he also received, this is something that he had received and he was now delivering or giving to them. And did you notice verse one, it says, He declared the gospel which he preached, which also they or you received? So Paul received something, he delivered it and shared it with them, and that's how the gospel message works. It is this amazing, miraculous, history altering event. That when people can came in contact with it. They declared it to others. They shared it with others, they told others about what they had heard.

Conrad Harkrider  05:09
When a person comes to know and believe this verse one, Paul says it's able to make them stand. In verse two, he says that this is the way that they can be saved. Believing and understanding this message offers life, and salvation. Notice in verse three, he says that this is of first importance. He says, first of all, or at the top of the list, the first thing on the list is the news about the resurrection we see in the Gospels. And in the book of Acts, that this was something that was emphasized over and over again, that it was a primary focus of the disciples. When Peter and the other apostles told people about Jesus, they almost always started with the fact that he was raised, that he had been raised from the dead. If you remember one of the criteria, when they were trying to find a replacement for Judas. One of the things that they said was they needed somebody who had been with them the entire time, during Jesus's ministry. And in Acts chapter one and verse 22. It says, beginning from the baptism of John until the day when he was taken up from us, one of these men must become with us a witness to his resurrection. That was a key component of selecting one of these men, that they would be a witness, they had seen the resurrection. And they would give testimony to that in Jerusalem, Judea, Samaria, and throughout the whole world. This was of first importance at the center of the gospel message. Also notice what he says here in First Corinthians, or in Acts chapter two and verse 32. It says, this, Jesus, God raised up, and of that we are all witnesses. This is the first sermon that's ever preached that's recorded on the day of Pentecost. And the claim that Peter is making with the other apostles is that this is something that they have seen, they have all become witnesses, to the fact that he was raised. In the second sermon recorded in Acts and Acts chapter three. And verse 15. It says, You killed the author of life whom God raised from the dead. To this, we are witnesses. Again, they were claiming to have seen something, and they're sharing that with those who would listen, the resurrection was a key component of their message. Also notice from First Corinthians, it says that this was according to the Scriptures. In verse three, he says that Christ died for our sins, according to the Scriptures. In verse four, he says, that He rose again the third day, according to the Scriptures, the death of Christ was not some unforeseen, unplanned thing that caught God off by surprise, or that surprised Jesus that they didn't know that it was going to happen. But rather, this had been foretold in the prophets and the Old Testament, and Isaiah 53. And in Zechariah, 12, there are details given about how his death would occur. In regards to the resurrection, there are illusions all throughout the Old Testament scriptures, Genesis 22, the story about Abraham and Isaac, when he took him up on the mountain, and for three days, they journeyed together, it also in Psalm 16, when David talks about not allowing your Holy One to see corruption. So there were references being made all throughout the scriptures, to the fact that the Christ, the Messiah was going to suffer and die. And then after three days, He would be raised from the dead.

Conrad Harkrider  09:24
This was God's plan. And it's something that Jesus brought up again and again, in his ministry, he told his disciples, this was what was going to happen to him. You remember one occasion, after saying that he was going to be crews that he was going to be given into the hands of men, that Peter took Him aside, he said, This will never happen to you, he repeat he rebuked the Lord. And Jesus turns around and says to him, Get behind me Satan. Jesus would not allow his even His disciples to deter from God ultimate plan this was according to the Scriptures. Well, I'd like to shift our focus to talk about some of the proofs of the wrecks, resurrection, how can we be certain that this is not just a a tale, a story that was made up, but something that actually occurred in history. And in order to think about that, I like to use something that I came across from a Writer Lee Strobel, who's written a few books on apologetics, the case for Christ and others. And that is the for ease of the resurrection. The for ease of the resurrection, the first IE, of how we know that the resurrection actually took place is executed. Jesus was executed. Jesus was a real person who was arrested by the Romans sentenced to death, and ultimately was executed by crucifixion. In the first century, there were 1000s of people that died by crucifixion. And millions others, millions of millions of others that died as a result of the wars and the rebellions that were going on. In the first century between the Jews and the Romans death at the hands of the Romans was not a unique or unusual thing. But there was something different and unique about Jesus, of all the people that suffered by crucifixion from the Romans. We know more about the details of Jesus and His death, and burial and the circumstances surrounding that event, and possibly any other person of antiquity, any other person of ancient history. And so we see that this is an event that was recorded, and discussed and talked about not just in the gospel record, but also people outside of the Christian faith. Let's start with John chapter 19. And John 19, in verse 32, it says, So the soldiers came and broke the legs of the first and the other who had been crucified with him. But when they came to Jesus and saw that he was already dead, they did not break his legs, but one of the soldiers piers to side with a spear. And at once there came out blood and water. He saw it has borne witness his testimony is true, and he knows that he is telling the truth that you may believe, as a challenge to the resurrection. Some have said that the reason that people saw Jesus alive after three days was because he wasn't actually dead. In the first place. This is referred to as the Swoon Theory, this idea that Jesus was just passed out, he was swooning, and he didn't actually lose his life. But in John's account, he makes it clear. The Romans were experts at carrying out capital punishment. They knew how to take a person's Life, if they weren't dying fast enough, they would break their legs. And when they came to Jesus, they realized that he had already succumbed to his injuries in the torture. And so instead of breaking his bones, they just put a spear up into his side. And notice how John speaks of this, it was clear to the Romans as well as to those who were standing by that Jesus and did in fact, had died. John is not writing about some mythical tale, as he says at the end, he saw it and bore witness his testimony is true. It's like he said, he's on the stand before the jury and the judge and he's re laying the things that he had seen. It's not just the gospel writers, though, that bear witness to the fact that Jesus was executed that he died. There's multiple references outside of the Bible, and one of those comes from a Roman historian who was also a senator named Tacitus. And he wrote about an event that we discussed in our Bible class this morning, the fire that happened in Rome around the year at 64. And this is what Tacitus said, about the great fire in Rome. He said to suppress the rumor, that is the rumor of why the fire occurred or what caused it. He being Nero, who was the emperor at the time, falsely charged with guilt with the guilt and punished with the most s exquisit tortures the persons commonly called Christians who are hated for their enormities Kristus, the founder of the name was put to death death by Pontius Pilate for Oh, curator of Judea in the reign of Tiberius Tacitus notes several things here he says that the Christians were falsely accused. In other words, the blame was put on them, but it wasn't their fault. He notes that they were hated for many of the things that they did. And they believed and that their founder was put to death by by Pontius Pilate.

Conrad Harkrider  15:26
This writer is not a believer. He's not a follower. He's not a disciple. He has no vested interest in bolstering or supporting the claims that the gospel writers made. He's simply recording events that took place. He mentions real people, he refers to actual government officials. And what this shows us is that the information the news about Jesus was not just some belief that a small group of people down in Judea held, but rather it was widely known these events had taken place that Christ had been executed. And so when you're talking with someone, or you yourself are thinking about is, is Christianity real is this is this something that is actually to be taken at face value. Just remember that the death of Jesus is verified. It's a real historical event. The second East stands for early. There are early accounts written about Jesus, His life, His death, and the fact that he was raised from the dead. The Gospel writers are not recording these things, fat hundreds of years after they occurred, where tradition and folklore and new information could get inserted, but rather, the news about Jesus and His resurrection begins to be proclaimed within a few months after his death. The book of Acts was probably written sometime in the 60s, as we discussed in our class this morning, which is about 40 or 50 years after the death of Christ. If you think about the Gospel of Luke, which is part one of Acts, it's written sometime before the book of Acts. And so around the same time within 40 to 50 years of when these events had occurred, but in Acts chapter 25, Luke relates an incident that happened with Paul when he is going before Festus. And in this case, Festus is the one speaking here, Luke is quoting Festus and Fest this is recounting the charges that have been brought against Paul Festus is telling King Agrippa. And he says, When the accusers stood up, they brought no charge in his case of such evils, as I suppose, rather, they had certain points of dispute with him about their own religion, and about a certain Jesus who was dead, but whom Paul asserted, to be live to be alive. So from Festivus perspective, the issue that's at hand here is that this person, Jesus has died. And Paul is saying that he is alive. And there are some other issues going on within the Jewish religion, that Jewish belief system that are that are being discussed. But the point is, it was very early on, that people were saying that Jesus had been raised that he was alive that they were asserting that claim, not hundreds of years after Jesus was on the earth, but within a few decades, this message is now spreading throughout the Roman world. If you compare that to something like the story of King Arthur, if you're familiar with that it's been made popular in books and movies with King Arthur, as far as we know, there was a man named Arthur who lived in the fifth or sixth century in England. And he was a warrior who fought back some of the invaders that were coming into Britain. But it wasn't until around 1100 that someone wrote a book about the history of the kings of Britain, and put some information in there about Arthur. And then over the next few 100 years, people began to take that account that story and layer things on top of it, things like the Knights of the Round Table and the sword in the stone and Excalibur and Merlin, the magician, and all of these things that now start getting getting placed in the story. And you can see how a tale or a myth like that

Conrad Harkrider  19:57
begins to grow over hundreds of years over For a period of time to where, now when we look back, we're not sure if those things actually took place. But that's different from what we find in the gospels in the New Testament. And First John chapter one. And verse three, John says, that which we have seen and heard, we proclaim also to you, this is not something that they have that's been passed down through the generations. But it's something that they have seen with their own eyes, so that you too, may have fellowship with us. And indeed, our fellowship is with the Father and with His Son, Jesus Christ. These men were writing close to the event, things that they had personal information and contact with. Also think about how quickly the gospel is spreading throughout the Roman world. It's not as if this event occurred, and then over hundreds and hundreds of years, it begins to spread and gain momentum. It's within a couple of decades, maybe 20 years, that people in Rome now are being followers, and adhering to this new doctrine, this new teaching. And so what happened down in Judea, to a little known peasant, Rabbi, Jesus of Nazareth, is now gaining the attention of people in the capital city of the most powerful empire in the world. And you just think about how there was this explosion of people coming to faith early on in the Gospels of count, and that is to say that this is no small town, urban legend of some Outcast group. This was something that had veracity and credibility as a historical event. Well, the next he is for empty. After three days, the tomb was found empty. The fact is, the body of Jesus was never recovered. Even the enemies of Jesus acknowledge that the body was not there in Matthew's Gospel, Matthew chapter 28, and verse 12. It says it when they had assembled with the elders and taken counsel, they gave a sufficient sum of money to the soldiers, and said, tell people, his disciples came by night and stole him away, while we were asleep. So the enemies of Jesus acknowledge that the body is not there, and what do they come up with? They say that the reason his body is no longer in the tomb is because the disciples have stolen it away, I want you to think about that for just a minute. The timid scattered disciples, at the time of His resurrection, they had been dispersed, but now they have come back together. And they have formulated a plan to go to the tomb in the middle of the night, to remove the very large stone to sneak in under the cover of darkness. For some reason, they unwrap the body from the burial clothes, and they carry the naked corpse out of the to off to a unknown destination, and dispose of it. All of this is done while the Roman guards who were supposed to be there watching over the body are sleeping. Now keep in mind, those guards are there life is on the line, if you're watching something in the first century in some, and there's an event that happens or something goes wrong, you pay for it with your life. And yet the disciples are able to sneak past the guard and get the body out. And then at that point, after they've accomplished this great feat, they go throughout Jerusalem and Judea, teaching and preaching about this man, Jesus, who in reality is just a stolen dead corpse, that he is the Lord of Life. Does that make any sense? Does that sound like a believable account? The fact is that the tomb was empty.

Conrad Harkrider  24:20
And even the enemies of Jesus, recognize and acknowledge that. Don't you think that the Jews in Jerusalem had incentive to produce a corpse? As the apostles are talking about the resurrection and more and more people are being converted and believing this? Don't you think that it would have been easier for them just to go and find the body produce the bones to show everyone that this in fact, is not true, but it never happened? They never went and dug up the corbs. In fact, the opposite was true in Acts chapter six and verse two Seven, it tells us Luke, Luke tells us that a great number of the priests were converted to the faith. So now you have the highest order of the Jewish belief system who are now being converted, believing in the resurrection. Some people say that the tomb was empty because they didn't even bury Jesus to begin with. There was there was no tomb at all, they just left him up on the cross to rot and the body was eaten by birds, and animals. Well, if you think about the, in the Old Testament, in Deuteronomy, chapter 21, there's information given about what to do with a body. Deuteronomy 21, verse 22, says that they weren't to leave it overnight, they were to take it down. And so there's reason to believe that even the Jewish leaders who had asked for Jesus to be crucified, they were in favor of bringing the body down and burying it. They don't want a corpse up on the eve of one of the most special and wholly Jewish feasts that's about to take place the Passover. And so there's good reason to believe that they would have also asked for the body to be removed, or they would have been in favor of having it removed. But think about the the gospel writers. If the body of Jesus had just been thrown into a heap into a pit and never was buried, why would they not start their account from the heap? After three days the body of Jesus was raised from the pile of corpses? Why would they go through so much trouble to give all of these details and this information about the burial? Listing specific people from actual places like air mithya Joseph of air mithya, Nikka Demas, talking about this tomb that was in a garden that no one had ever laid in. And then they get further details about the morning when he was raised the women who go and they are at their at the the two of Jesus. If you're trying to make up a story, you don't want to give specific details, because the more information you provide, the more likely it is to be refuted. But the fact is that there was a tomb. And on that third day, they found that the tomb was empty. The final E stands for eye witnesses. Eye witnesses, it wasn't just that there was an empty tomb. People didn't believe in the resurrection of Jesus solely based upon the absence of a body think about Mary when she got to the tomb on that Sunday morning. And she realized that the body wasn't there. She was distraught, she was upset. She assumed it's that someone had taken the body and she didn't know where they had placed it. They weren't convinced by the absence of a body, they were convinced by the presence of the risen body of Jesus Christ. They saw these things for themselves. They were I witnesses of His resurrection. In Second Peter chapter one, verse 16. It says, For we did not follow cleverly devised myths, when we made known to you the power in the coming of the Lord of our Lord Jesus Christ. But we were eyewitnesses of his majesty. Peter is either lying, or he is grossly misled.

Conrad Harkrider  28:42
But from his perspective, they were following the things that they had seen and heard and understand, understood, they were eyewitnesses of their firsthand experience. Think about the variety of witnesses. There was both men and women. It wasn't just a single occasion or one incident or event. You think about if you've ever been in a big city before, and somebody has passed by and you thought that they looked like a neighbor, a friend, or even a family member who has passed, and it almost catches your eye you you think to yourself that look just like this person that I know. But these were passing occurrences Jesus sat down and talked with them. He ate with them, he spent time with them. Some people have argued that they were hallucinating or that they, in their grief. They had just made up these stories. But Paul makes it clear in the in the account that we read in First Corinthians 15 When he says that over 500 Brethren saw him at one time would 500 People hallucinate or imagined something all together. He also appeared to those who were doubters, think about Thomas who said that he would not believe leave unless he saw the prince, the handprints, the nail prints in his hands. And the the wound in his side. Also James, the brother of Jesus was not a believer during the ministry of Christ, but became one of the primary pillars, one of the early leaders in the church. And then there's the apostle Paul, the apostle Paul was a man who was determined to persecute and stamp out this new teaching. But as we know, on a mission as he's going to Damascus to try to find people there who are professing this new belief system. He goes from Avid persecutor to ardent proclaimer. There's a complete 180 that we see in the life of the apostle Paul. And so Paul would ultimately be beaten and imprisoned and put to death for his faith for his, his confession of Jesus, his testimony. And the question we have to ask is that if these people were lying, if they were just making this stuff up? Why would they go through so much? Why would they sacrifice and give so much for something that wasn't true? Why are they trying to convince people about the resurrection? What did they have to gain? What benefit were they receiving? By trying to pull this off? What we see from the Gospels and from x and the history of the first century is that these witnesses completely turned the world upside down. They, within just a few decades, the news about His resurrection had been carried throughout the known world. They converted and convicted all kinds of people at the highest levels, governors and princes, all the way down to slaves and peasants. They were teaching to both Jews and Gentiles rich and poor. They helped transform the moral structure of society, you think about a lot of the laws that we have in place today, the beliefs that we hold to the things that we consider as a starting Porter, a starting point, or a baseline for our belief system, our morals in this society, a lot of that comes from the things that these men wrote. And so we have to ask ourselves, were they crazy? Were they liars? Or were they testifying of the things that they had seen in herd? Did the resurrection actually happen? is such an important question. Because there are so many things that can happen in this world that can cause us to question our faith. We look around and we see the evil that's going on in the world today. Or we see events that happen, catastrophes, disasters, diseases, wars, things that are going on in our world, and people might question the presence or the, the the presence of God does he actually exist. But we can always come back to this fact.

Conrad Harkrider  33:21
If the resurrection actually took place, then God is real. If the resurrection actually took place, then Jesus is who he says he was. His word is true, we can believe in the things that he taught and spoke. Our faith is not based upon wishful thinking but on a historical and verifiable account of the resurrection. It is the cornerstone of our faith. As Paul said, without the resurrection, we are of most people to be pitied in this world. The resurrection gives us hope. The resurrection changes our lives. Paul said that God has fixed the day when he's going to judge the world. How do we know that judgment is true? Because he had raised this man Jesus from the dead. In the resurrection, we realize our need for God, to repent of our sins, to turn away from a life that is focused on self and instead one that is submissive towards our Creator. We're gonna close this morning with a song and if there's something that we can do to encourage you in your walk with Christ, to submit your life to God to repent of your sins, to be baptized and have your sins washed away. We want to do whatever we can to help or encourage you this morning. Please come down to the front as we stand in scene
