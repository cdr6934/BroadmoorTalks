It's good to see each of you here this morning if you want to be turning in your Bibles to Matthew chapter 11.

Each year the magazine time features a person or a group of people on their front cover as the person of the year. They generally select someone who has done something in the prior year to greatly influence the people or the nations or the events around them. In 1927, in its first selection, the magazine shows Charles Lindbergh, who was the first person to fly across the Atlantic Ocean, in a solo mission on in the airplane, from New York City to Paris. And you can imagine or guests as those who have been selected after him presidents world leaders, astronauts, successful businessmen, all people who have influenced those around them. Each of them have had some type of acts of some type of success. They've been elected to a high office or they've achieved some great military victory. And so for that reason, they are named the Person of the Year. In Matthew chapter 11, Jesus tells His disciples about a man who is not just the person of the year or the decade or even the century. What he says about this man is that he was the greatest person who ever lived. Look with me at Matthew chapter 11, in verse 11, what it says, Assuredly, I say to you, among those born of women there has not risen one greater than John the Baptist, John, The Who? John the Baptist. You mean to tell me that he was greater than King David and King Solomon? And what about people outside of the scriptures like Alexander the Great's and Julius Caesar and Augustus? Didn't Jesus know his history of people who had come and accomplished so much in their lifetime? And yet he says, that this man was the greatest, how can that be? I want to spend a few minutes this morning looking at some of the things that Matthew tells us from Matthew chapter three about one that Isaiah calls the voice of one crying in the wilderness, this great man who came to prepare God's people, for the coming Messiah. So read with me in Matthew chapter three, beginning in verse one. Matthew three and verse one. In those days, John the Baptist came preaching in the wilderness of Judea, and saying, Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. For this as he who was spoken of by the prophet Isaiah sang, the voice of one crying in the wilderness, Prepare the way of the Lord make his paths straight. Now, John himself was clothed in camels hair, with a leather belt around his waist, and His food was locusts and wild honey, then Jerusalem, all Judea and all the region around the Jordan went out to him, and were baptized by him in the Jordan, confessing their sins.

Before Jesus begins, his ministry, we're told about this man, John the Baptist, and Matthew gives a quote from the book of Isaiah, Isaiah chapter 40. In verse three, he says that this would be one who is crying out in the wilderness, his purpose would be to prepare the way for the Lord. His job was to get the people ready for the Messiah to announce his coming. And he did this in verse one, by preaching in the wilderness by teaching the people that's how he was getting them ready for the Christ. It says that he was crying hang out. This was a message that was urgent and important. If there was a fire that had started in the back of the building, and you were the only one that knew about it, would you come out and whisper to everyone that there's a fire? Or would you quietly say it to yourself over in the corner? No, that's something that needs to be communicated and told very plainly and clearly to people so that they know so that they are aware this was a message of urgency, John came openly and boldly proclaiming the news about the kingdom. Let's take a look at some of the different aspects of his life. First of all, notice where John lived, where he spent his time, not in Jerusalem. He didn't have a private residence above the temple courts where people would come and they could receive His teaching. He wasn't even living in a town or a village. But it says in verse one, in those days, John the Baptist came preaching in the wilderness of Judea. John is out in the wilderness out in a desolate, deserted place. If you think about the opportune locations, to set yourself up to be able to have an impact on other people, the wilderness seems like a very unusual place to pick and yet we still see people are flocking out. To see him. Verse five says that they're coming from Jerusalem, from Judea from all the region around the Jordan, they come out to see him. And so despite being in this remote location, the crowds are coming. In the Scriptures, the wilderness is often a place where God's people find themselves before they inherit or receive some type of blessing or renewal. The wilderness is a place that is dry and desolate, but God's people are often shown coming out of that place to inherit some type of blessing from God. Let me give you a few examples. Moses found himself in the wilderness taking care of his father in law's sheep. And it was in the wilderness where he encountered the burning bush and God said, I want you to go back to Egypt and bring my people out of captivity. The children of Israel were wandering in the wilderness for 40 years before they were able to enter into the land that was promised to them. David King David was held up in the wilderness stuck in a cave before he assumed his place on the throne. Jesus was driven into the wilderness to be tempted by Satan before he began his ministry, God often uses the wilderness as a staging ground, as a place to prepare people for what's about to come next. And the fact that John is in the wilderness, and his role is to prepare the people for the coming. Messiah think there's a connection that we should see there. Also, the wilderness can reflect the spiritual condition of the nation of Israel. Look with me in Isaiah chapter 35. Isaiah chapter 35. In verse one, Isaiah has a number of prophecies about the coming of God's Kingdom, the renewal the blessing that is going to be received. In Isaiah chapter 35.

Conrad Harkrider  09:08
It says, the wilderness and the wasteland shall be glad for them and the desert shall rejoice and blossom as a rose. It shall blossom abundantly and rejoice even with joy and singing. The glory of Lebanon shall be given to it the excellence of Carmel and Sharon, they shall see the glory of the Lord, the excellency of our God. Strengthen the weak hands and make firm that feeble knees, say to those who are fearful hearted, be strong, do not fear. Behold, your God will come with vengeance with recompense of God, He will come and save you. Then the eyes of the blind shall be opened the ears of the deaf shall be unstopped. Then the lame shall leap like a deer and the tongue of the dumb seeing, for the waters shall burst forth in the wilderness. On this, and streams in the desert, there's going to be all of these amazing blessings that are poured out. He says in verse five, that the eyes of the blind are going to be open the ears of the deaf, deaf unstopped. The lame shall leap like a deer. But notice how he describes how he pictures, this renewal. In verse six, he says, the waters shall burst forth in the wilderness, that the Messiah is going to bring redemption and restoration and salvation to people to people who are spiritually dead, to a nation that is dry and parched, and dying. And that renewal starts with the message of John and where is John preaching in the wilderness? As we think about that, picture, that scene of the wilderness isn't it true for us today, if we are not walking with Christ? If Christ is not in our lives, then it is as if we are living in the wilderness, a place that is barren and fruitless, you don't build a city out in the desert where there are no resources, there's no water, there's no trees, there's no wood, because you can't survive. There's no hope. And the same is true when we are not living in Christ. We look at a person who is making money. They are successful, they are popular, they are good looking, they are well liked. And we think to ourselves, they seem pretty happy things are going well for them. But make no mistake, regardless of the external blessings and talents and benefits that we may have in this life. A life without God, regardless of what it looks like, on the outside is ultimately one that has no direction and purpose. You and I were created by someone. We were fashioned and formed and made by the Lord of heaven and earth. And He is the only one that can provide insight and perspective and guidance on what this life is supposed to be about. What is the meaning and purpose and significance of why we are here and anything else is just like wandering around aimlessly in a dry wilderness. That's where John is, is doing his preaching, and he's trying to bring the nation out of bareness and dryness. When our brother Sergei who lives in Moldova came to speak to us this last summer. He talked about his life living in the former Soviet Union. And he described a country that had tried to remove God to completely remove any trace of his influence. And you want to know what that looked like. There was violence and murder and abuse, and complete disregard for life. And what he said to us was that he and many others saw their existence as utterly pointless like a wilderness.

Conrad Harkrider  13:56
What John is announcing in Christ is something that offers so much more Christ brings abundance. Christ is that water, that fruit in a dry land, he brings hope and renewal and blessing and reward, and he can take a barren wasteland, a soul that is dried over and hardened and parched, and he can turn it into something that is lush, and beautiful, something that has hope and purpose and direction. We'll also notice what Matthew tells us about what John wore. Look at verse four. Matthew chapter three and verse four. An interesting detail about his dress. It says, Now John himself was clothed and camel's hair with a leather belt around his waist. John wore the latest fashion statement of camels hair, and a leather belt and isn't Interesting choice or selection for the spokesman of the Messiah to be dressed in this way, all of these people are coming out to him, some of them thinking, doesn't he have anything else or maybe even some people tried to give him another piece of clothing to wear. But the fact that the writers in the Gospel tell us about this indicates that there was probably some significance tied to what John is wearing here that this dress was intentional camels hair and a leather belt. In Second Kings chapter one, we're told about King a Hosea, he was the king over Israel at the time. And he had a little incident where he fell in his palace, and he got hurt. And he became ill from his injuries. And so he sent some of his messengers to one of the false gods in the land, to inquire to see what was going to happen to him, if he was going to get better. And as the messengers go on their way they encounter a prophet of the Lord. And the Prophet says, Go back and tell a Messiah that he's not going to get better than in fact, he is going to die because He has asked for guidance or counsel from this fool from this false god. So the messengers go back to the palace, and when they get there, a Messiah says, How are you back so soon? And they say, well, we encountered this prophet, and he said that you are not going to get better that you are going to die. And upon hearing the news, or the verdict from this prophet, a Uzziah asks this question, What did he look like? What did he look like? And the messengers answered and said to him, he wore a garment of hair with a belt of leather around his waist. And he said, It is Elijah. The Tisch by Second Kings, chapter one and verse eight. He doesn't need a picture or a video or a soundbite. He knows exactly who it is, it is Elijah. And so it is John comes in the Spirit and the power of Elijah, he is dressed like one of the prophets. Can you imagine if you were standing outside of Buckingham Palace, and you're waiting for the queen to come out and present herself, but before the doors open up, a man comes in front of the gate, and he is dressed in a robe made of camel's hair, and he's not wearing any shoes. And he says, I present to you the Queen of England, that would be absurd, that would be out of place for someone who is not dressed more stately or professionally. But that's what we see in John. John was not announcing the coming of another monarch or a king or queen, but instead, the ruler over all creation, the Son of God. And yet he's wearing camels hair. What does that say about John? I wonder if John would be allowed to come into our churches today. I wonder if we would let a guy like John get up in the pulpit and deliver a lesson. John was clearly not concerned about his appearance.

Conrad Harkrider  18:56
But instead he was focused on his responsibility on his god given mission, about why he was there, what he had come to do. And it didn't matter what the people thought of him or if he was well liked, or if he was well received, because he was going to preach His message and preach it boldly. Now, I'm not saying that we need to all go out and buy the latest candles, hair, quote, coats and start wearing that in the in the winter. But I want you to think about this aspect of a man of God who had come for a specific purpose was not concerned with the external. Do we place too much emphasis on the outside on the external on what other people can see? number of years ago, I had some guys over to my house for a fantasy football draft party. And I had volunteered to make all of the food for the people that had come. And so we decided to grill burgers and if if you've ever done that before, you know that if you put a bunch of patties over the flame as the grease drips down, the flame goes up. And so it was it was cooking. And I think I sacrificed some of my eyebrows for the sake of that meal, trying to get it ready. But eventually they looked done and they weren't charged to a Chris so we got them off the grill took them inside. And everyone started to dress them up just how they like they put all the we had all the fixings, put your cheese on top, and then the lettuce and the pickles and tomatoes. And it's some people are like decorating a Christmas tree. You know, they're just they're so careful with how they're putting everything on there. But all the condiments, the mustard, mayo ketchup, they put it on to the bun. And then around the room, you started getting the first bites into the burgers. And they were completely raw on the inside. And some people were actually kind of nice about it. You know, they tried to just eat the outsides. They don't want to say anything. And one guy, he actually took his and just he went over the microwave and just put it in there without saying anything. You know, it didn't he didn't want to offend me whatnot. But the burgers were not edible. They looked great. They looked wonderful. They were all done up with all of the trimmings. And yet we couldn't eat them. How much attention to do we give to our appearance to what others think about us the clothes we wear the house we live in the things that we have, how much of our time and energy and our money is spent on what others can see. How much do we think about what other people think about me? I want to be well liked. I want to be perceived as smart, educated, athletic, charming. Whatever. How much time are we spending on the things that people can't see? Like our character and our relationships. The fruit of the Spirit is not something that you can buy at the store or cover up with makeup. It takes time to develop love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness and self control. Where are we placing our emphasis, John apparently was not worried about what everyone was going to think about him he was focused on his purpose on what God had brought him here to do. Also notice what John ate out there in the desert. In verse four, it says that His food was locusts and wild honey. John lived Verse Four on a diet of locust and honey.

Conrad Harkrider  23:33
Next time you sit down at the table and you are unhappy with what mom has put before you just be thankful that your parents have not adopted the John the Baptist diet of eating bugs and wild honey. It's interesting that we're told about what he ate. Maybe this was to show the lifestyle that he lived. He's out in these rugged places, and so he's just taking whatever is available to him. Or maybe this is pointing to the fact that he lived a very humble life style. Certainly you don't find locust or grasshoppers being served at the royal banquet table for the king. But perhaps there was some other type of significance to why he was eating these things. God often had prophets eat things for some type of purpose or significance is EQL made a special kind of bread and Ezekiel chapter four, as he was real as God was relaying to him the events that were going to happen with the siege in Jerusalem. In the book of Revelation, the angel tells John to take the tiny scroll and to eat it it will be bitterness in his stomach and sweetness in his mouth. So perhaps John's choice of food had a connection to his ministry. And to the message that he brought. Think for just a few moments about the references to locust in the scriptures. What do locusts generally convey? In the book of Exodus, Exodus chapter 10. The eighth plague that God brought upon the Egyptians was locust, they came and they eat up the crops, they destroy everything. In the book of Joel and Joel, chapter one, the prophet tells about how the Locust are going to come and destroy the land. In Joel chapter one, in verse 10, after the locus of control, it says the fields are destroyed, the ground mourns, because the grain is destroyed, the wind dries up the oil languishes. This was God bringing his judgment upon the land. In contrast to that honey is often associated with sweetness with abundance. The children of Israel were said to, they were going to inherit a land that was flowing with milk and honey, God's word is often compared to the sweetness of honey. And so maybe these things that John is eating are also symbolic of his message. He brought a message of judgment or punishment, as well as a message of renewal. Look at verse 12. Matthew chapter three. It says His winnowing fan is in his hand, and He will thoroughly clean out his threshing floor and gather His wheat into the barn, but He will burn up the chaff with unquenchable fire. There's two aspects of what's happening there. He's gathering up his wheat into the barn, that's harvest time. That's plenty. That's God's blessing. God has given bounty, and you're gathering it up into the barn. But he also talks about the chaff that's going to be burned with unquenchable fire. So you have these two elements here of the of John's preaching judgment, and punishment, and then also renewal and hope. And really, the gospel message has not changed. From the time that John began proclaiming it in the wilderness. Both of these elements are present. And both of them are essential. If you think about what we stress in our preaching and teaching, or in our conversations, or in our thought process, about what the gospel is all about, do we elevate or emphasize one of these aspects over the other? Do we present God's forgiveness and hope, without warning people about his justice and judgment? If we focus only on the grace of God and His endless forgiveness, then that can produce a spirit of carelessness, where people think we just live how we want because God's grace covers it. As Paul said, we continue in sin so that grace can about Romans chapter one. But on the other hand, if we overemphasize judgment, and our need to respond to God's call, then that can produce

Conrad Harkrider  28:35
a service to God that is done out of fear out of obligation, kind of a checklist mentality, we become self reliant, we think it's because of my actions or my good deeds, that ultimately God accepts me. Both of these are necessary and needed. People need to be aware of the wrath of God that will one day be poured out on all who disobey Him. Ephesians chapter five and verse six, but they also need to know about the love of God that has been poured out in our hearts through the Holy Spirit who has been given to us Romans chapter five, and verse five. So judgment and hope or renewal. And then finally, think about what John said. In verse two. It says that John's message, what he was preaching, Matthew, chapter three and verse to repent, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. John preached repentance to the people. He was telling them to change their ways. Think about all the things that John could have said to them. These people are coming out of their homes and their villages to come to see John. And you might think that he's going Want to say something that will build them up that will strengthen them that will encourage them that will help them on their way. But instead, John says you need to change. You need to repent, you need to redirect your course. Look at verse six. It says that as they were baptized by him in the Jordan, they confessed their sins. They were denouncing the evil in their lives, it's more than just repentance is more than just feeling bad about something. Or it's more than just getting dunked in the water, it involves exposing sin. And then in verse eight, he says, he says, Therefore bear fruits worthy of repentance. So not only is it a feeling of remorse, but it produces action, it produces change in our life. And if you've been a Christian for a year, or 10 years, or however long of a period, you know that repentance is not just a one time thing. It's not just something that we take care of in our 20s, and then we're good for the rest of the time. It remains a constant part of our devotion and service to God, changing our thoughts, recollecting our course, if you think about driving a car, you get in the car and you're going down the road, you're in your lane, that's great. You're doing what you're supposed to be doing. You never get to a point where you can just close your eyes and take your hands off the wheel, there's always a need to be focused to be paying attention. And there's always a need for correction, if I get off at the wrong exit, I need to figure out where I'm going and get back on. If I start to kind of merge over into the next lane over I correct and get back in to where I'm supposed to be. There's constant adjustment. The danger is if we stop paying attention, we say we're going in the wrong direction. We're heading east instead of West. And yet we don't we don't care. Or we don't bother to to make any kind of adjustment. When we start going the wrong way. Repentance is what helps us turn back to God. It is a safety a safeguard for us. In Ezekiel chapter 33, and verse 11. The Lord says, Say to them as I live declares the Lord GOD, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but that the wicked turn from his way and live. Turn back, turn back from your evil ways for Why will you die oh house of Israel. Repentance leads us back to the way of life. And it's important for all of us when we see sin in our life that we are willing, as they were to confess, acknowledge, and then bear fruits that are worthy of repentance, to show that we have changed that we're back on the right track.

Conrad Harkrider  33:20
Finally, we see that John pointed to Christ. In verse 11, it says, I indeed baptize you with water unto repentance, but He who is coming after me is mightier than I whose sandals I am not worthy to carry, He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit, and fire. John says, Don't be enamored with me. Don't be impressed with me, because there is one that is coming after me. And I'm not even worthy to carry his shoes around. I'm not even worthy to do the lowest task something that would have been reserved for a servant, or slave. He's the one that needs to be given the glory, given the praise, given the recognition. And so it should be in our lives. Does Christ receive the honor? Is he magnified as he lifted up in our lives? When people look at us and they see the good that we've done? The kindness, the love, the blessing that we've maybe imparted to someone's life? Do we redirect them back to Christ? Do we point people to the Messiah. Ultimately, it's him working in us not to our own credit, or glory. We're going to close with a song and an opportunity and invitation for those who are here if there's something that we can do to encourage you in your walk with Christ. The invitation was made by John repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand and is still outstanding to all who are willing like to receive it there's something we can do to encourage you or help you in your walk come down to the front as we stand and sing
