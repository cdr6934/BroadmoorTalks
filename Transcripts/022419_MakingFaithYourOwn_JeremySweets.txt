Good morning. I have a full house today and certainly good to see everyone out today. I was talking to the song leader earlier and he knows that I like to talk about current events sometimes. And so he asked me if I was going to be preaching on Noah and the ark and the flood. That is not going to be the topic of our sermon this morning. If you would open your Bibles to Second Timothy chapter one and verse five, Second Timothy chapter one and verse five. Let's talk about a different subject that I think is equally important. Again, I appreciate the fact that everyone's here today. I appreciate that you're here to worship God. And at this time, we're gonna be opening up our Bibles and studying from God's Word. God is true. God never lies we can count on His Word. And so I look forward to opening up God's word with you at this time. In Second Timothy chapter one and verse five. There Paul says to Timothy, I'm reminded of your sincere faith, a faith that dwelt first in your grandmother Lois, and in your mother Eunice. And now I am sure dwells in you as well. Here Paul talks to Timothy about his sincere faith that first well, in his mother, Lois or his grandmother Lois and his mother, Eunice. You see, his faith was passed down. It's really I like to talk about making faith, your own faith is something that is often passed down, it's often something that spoke, I'm sure there's somebody that is simply taking the Word of God and read the Bible and become a Christian from that. But the the general pattern of things is that people are told about the gospel, it is a spoken message. It is something that we are told about it is good news. And so as we are told about that, and especially as children are told about that, it's not enough for the teller, the speaker, the one that's telling about the good news to have faith, when we are told about that we have to make that faith our own. And so notice, as we talk about this, we're talking about a past down faith. In Second Timothy one and verse five, you'll notice a few key words there, Paul says I'm reminded of your sincere faith. This was Timothy's faith, even though it was passed down to him. This was a faith that he had made his own. And this was something that was sincere for Timothy. It was not something he simply borrowed. It was not something that he simply had by relationship to those that were faithful. But this was rather his sincere faith in Second Timothy, chapter three and verse 14. And actually, I'll read a little bit of the broader context and verse 12. He says, There indeed all who desire to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be persecuted, while evil people and imposters will go on from bad to worse, deceiving and being deceived. But as for you continue in what you have learned and have firmly believe, knowing from whom you learned it and how from childhood you have been acquainted with the sacred writings which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus, that broader context is important because it talks about the fact that all those who desire to live godly in Christ Jesus will be persecuted, there will come a testing, and it's often when that that testing comes that faith is test. Is faith genuine? Is it strong enough to withstand the test, and the pastor says there are some that are used as the language imposters. They are not genuine or real. They have not held on Tiller faith. But Paul says Timothy, but as for you continue in what you have learned and have firmly believed. See, for Timothy, this was not something that he had simply heard about. And again, it's not something that he was merely around as he grew up. But this is something that he had learned and firmly believed himself, making faith your own. It's an important topic. In fact, if we were to look at some statistics

Jeremy Sweets  04:47
the Barna Group in 2006 found that 61% of young adults people in their 20s that had been regularly attending churches, teens were disengaged from their faith. They were no no longer practicing their faith no longer going to church or reading their bible or doing any of those things. Another statistic from the campus renewal group said in 2017, that 70% of college students end up leaving their faith during the first year on campus. Now, those statistics, again, that's a broad group, I'm not, I didn't see all the details that went into those studies, they seem high to me, that is shocking to see that number. And I don't know that that's my experience with the young people I've known. But whatever the statistic is, we know that it's too high don't. Because we know people, we know young people that have not retained their faith that have left the faith. And we also know that scripture talks about the parable of the soils. And two out of the three out of those four soil's accepted the word initially, but two of those four departed from the faith, they lost their faith. So whatever the statistics say, and these are frightening statistics, we know that people lose their faith, leave their faith do not hold on to their faith. And so I'm talking to you today that we need to make faith, our own. So this subject is something that's important, I would say, especially for young people, I usually don't try to define young people, I was actually asked in the car ride here, what the sermon was on us, and I'm talking about making faith your own I'm talking, maybe, especially to young people, making sure that what you've been taught is, in fact, what you yourself have. And the question came back. Are you talking to kids? Are you talking to people like Nick Nichols? So I'm not going to define what Young is, but one of my children find Nick Nichols as that group. Well, I will say that this is a subject for young people, but not only for young people, as we grow older, there are many people that may be have still yet to make faith their own. And I would also say that we never come to a point in our faith where we've reached the pinnacle either do we, we can increase our faith more and more and certainly need to do that. Leaving home for young people is really a time of transition. And it creates a lot of it creates a unique situation. When young people leave home, there is a newfound freedom. Parents are not dictating their schedule, and the places they go and the things they do, there is a freedom to make those decisions. Peer pressure can run high as people want to fit in. That's something that's not restricted to young people. Certainly, college life presents a new world with people from all different backgrounds, practices, and beliefs. There's also respectability in society, not so much for Christianity, many people look down upon the backward ways of Christianity, but there's respectability and social causes and movements that are not shackled by the outdated teachings of Christianity, as some call them. Many teachers also are opposed to faith, and they provide an academic basis or foundation or what appears to be of academic foundation for rejecting faith.

Jeremy Sweets  08:46
Others that leave home and don't go to college find the same set of challenges, as they set their own path and determine their own way. And you don't have to be in college, you know that society has an increasing influence upon people today. We live in a world of 24/7 news, tweets, opinions, memes. And society takes hold of us presenting his viewpoint at all times. And so while young people may be highly susceptible for these reasons, it's something we all need to look out for. We all need to be aware of this. It's not enough simply to be around those that have taught us but we need to take hold of our own faith. We need to make that faith, not just a pass down faith but a personal faith, a personal faith. The goal of our faith is that we would make it personal and that we would take ownership of what we have learned from others. We would make it our own and only then is it truly valid. As I say God has no grandchildren. We can't be a child of God. simply by who our parents are, or by someone else that has taught us we must make faith, our own. Notice if you would a passage in Philippians, chapter two, verses 12 and 13, Philippians, two verses 12 and 13. It says, Therefore, my beloved, as you have always obeyed, so now, not only is in my presence, but much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling, for it is God who works in you both to will and to work for His good pleasure. The first thing I'll notice about this passages is why or in the the occasion in which Paul is giving this instruction, he tells them to do this in his absence. He says, Now, you did this in my presence, but I want you to make sure that you do this in my absence as well. When we are to have our own faith, sometimes that's tested when we are away from those that taught us, for young people if they go away from their parents. And so that's the time of testing. Yes, you may be able to do this in the presence of others. But can you do this in their absence as well? And Paul says, Yes, please do this in my absence, as well do what? Well, he tells them to work out their salvation, work out your own salvation. He says, here, this idea of workout means to bring or result about by doing something means to achieve or to accomplish. It includes the idea of bringing about or seeing something through to fruition. Your salvation is something that, that you must work it. Now we are saved by the grace of God, not according to our deeds, not according to our actions. That's not the basis of our salvation. But God says it is those that are faithful and continue on that will be saying, and so we see the need to not only accept the gospel message, and then since have our sins washed away, but as Paul was saying, he doesn't really attain that salvation until the end, until he has lived a faithful life. And so Paul says, work out your own salvation, continue to work at this continue to be a faithful child of God. And you need to do that not only in my presence, but also in my absence. The attitude that he says must go along with this is one of fear and trembling before God, certainly not arrogance, certainly not pride. But in a recognition of who God is. We continue to work at our salvation with fear and trembling before Him, knowing that it is God that both wills and works for His good pleasure and he is at work within us. This is not a call, as he says, to work out your own salvation to complete independence. No, this is a dependent faith, but it is one that has not given up on it is one that is worked at, and it is one that requires our effort requires our effort. So Paul says, Make your faith a personal thing. Only notice a couple other passages in Ephesians chapter four fasion chapter four, and verse nine.

Jeremy Sweets  13:33
You know, when it comes to our faith, we are either growing spiritually, or we are dying spiritually. We are growing or dying. And notice we see a couple of these characteristics or we see both of these sides of the spiritual equation here, spiritual maturity and immaturity. He says in Ephesians, four in verse nine, he gave the apostle or he gave the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, the shepherds and teachers to equip the saints, for the work of ministry, for the building up in the body of Christ until we all attain to the unity of the faith, and the knowledge of the Son of God. Notice what he says here to mature manhood, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ, so that we may no longer be children tossed to and fro by the waves and carried about by every wind of doctrine, by human cunning by craftiness in deceitful schemes, rather, speaking, the truth and love were to grow up in every way into him who is the head in to Christ. Notice here part of the purpose of this teaching, group of apostles, prophets, evangelists, those that would equip the saints, they're to be equipped for the work of service, and they are to continuing to grow. Growth comes through continual listening to heating and abiding in the teaching, the doctrine of Christ He says that they are to grow to the stature of the fullness of Christ, there is growth that occurs here. He says on the other side of things, we're not to be like children tossed to and fro. He says, by the waves and carried about by every wind of doctrine. If we were to make our faith our own, we really see a crossroads here, we will add, we will either listen to the teachings found in God's were, and abide in those things. And we will seek to grow to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ, or we will grow as it says into him who is the head into Christ, we will either stay in fast in the teaching of Christ, or the other alternative, there has to be children. And how does it describe those children, spiritual children, those that are tossed to and fro, those that chase after the newest fad, those that are attracted to what is new and shiny, those that are dudes, those that follow after human cunning craftiness deceitful schemes, it says. And so the Crossroads is their spiritual maturity, or immaturity. In the previous chapter, Paul also talks about this maturity and I found the language interesting that he used in Ephesians, three in verses 16 through 19. Paul pray that he may grant speaking of God may grant you to be strengthened with power through his Spirit and your inner being. so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith that you being rooted and grounded in love may have strength to comprehend with all the saints, what is the breadth, and length and height and depth, and to know the love of Christ that surpasses knowledge that you may be filled with all the fullness of God. Notice that Paul's prayer was that they would have spiritual maturity, that they would make their faith their own, and he uses the language that they would be strengthened that they would be rooted and grounded there. He also says that they would comprehend and come to know the love of Christ that surpasses knowledge, and that they would be filled with all the fullness of God. I love those words. And that imagery that comes about that is spiritual maturity. And that's that process of being strengthened, rooted, grounded, knowing, comprehending, and being filled with the fullness of God. Those are the options. Those are the options, and that's what we're striving for, as Christians. So the past down faith needs to become a personal faith, a personal faith. Well, let's look at some practical steps for developing this personal faith. How is it that we can make this faith our own? Make it our own?

Jeremy Sweets  18:06
I've listed several I'm sure there's other we can list. I think I say that every time. I'm sure you don't think always have a comprehensive list. But I always feel like there's more I could say there's more I'm leaving out. Notice a few ways in which we can develop a personal faith. First of all, we need to do the hard work of introspection. In Second Corinthians 13 And verse five, here he talks about the most important test you'll ever take. And that is examining yourself. Maybe I should say that's in preparation for the examination of God, that most important test you could take. In Second Corinthians 13 Five, he says, Examine yourselves to see whether you are in the faith, test yourselves, or do you not realize that about yourself that Jesus Christ is in you, unless indeed you all fail to meet the test. Paul says Examine yourselves examine your heart. And that's not something that it's easy to do. When we are confronted with wrongdoing, our initial reaction is to deny our initial reaction is to shift blame. It's very rare that we own up and say, I'm completely wrong in this. Those words don't often happen. But when it comes to being a Christian, that's exactly what we have to do before God and before others, we have to acknowledge the fact that we've sinned. We have to acknowledge the tendencies of our heart in which we strive after sin, in which we are attracted to temptation and will seek to go after those things unencumbered, we have to pay attention to that. And so we have to do this hard work of considering ourselves. One of the philosopher said, know yourself, and that's the greatest challenge. Know your heart, consider your heart and test yourself if you're going to develop a faith of your own. You can't do that by having others simply working to your heart, but you have to examine your own heart. And this is something that's not only for those that would become Christians, but certainly for those that are Christians and an ongoing process, examine yourself, examine your heart, test yourselves, it says, so do the hard work there. Being a Christian doesn't require some great feet, some athletic feet, or intellectual feet, anything like that. In some ways, it may be easier if that were the case, if we simply had a standard bar, and we just have to reach that and be done with it. That's not required. That's not what is required to be a Christian to be a child of God. In some ways, it's much more difficult. It's controlling ourselves and giving our lives completely over to God, not for just a brief time until we pass some kind of test, but are not ongoing and regular basis, examining our hearts, if you're to have a faith of your own, you need to do the hard work of introspection. Not only that, but you need to know God. And Psalm 46 And verse 10, it says, Be still and know that I am God, I will be exalted among the nations I will be exalted in the earth, we must pause and reflect on who God is.

Jeremy Sweets  21:25
And that will require a lot of thought from us. That's something that we don't find the answered simply in a book. It's not something where we we come to a full knowledge of what that is, but it's something we sit with, and meditate on, and reflect on and we grow in life with the knowledge of who God is, and his greatness. And as we reflect on that, and grow in that, it will help shape how we understand ourselves and our purpose in this life. I believe if we truly know how great and awesome God is, that goes a long way in developing our faith, because it's hard to understand God's greatness and His Majesty, and yet turn away from that. Often, what happens is people turn their back, turn their eyes, hide their head in the sand, simply ignore those things about God and who he is. If they are to live how they want. We need to know God, be still reflect on him, thinking about God and who he is. And what he has done for us will go a long way, in helping you make your face your own. We also need to be active, be active. In James one in verse 22, it says, but be doers of the word and not hearers only deceiving yourselves, it's not enough to be taught the Word of God. It's not enough to hear the Word of God. But if you're to make faith, your own, you need to get in high gear, you need to put it into practice, you need to be a doer, a doer of the word. And not only here, this is reflected again in James one in verse 27, when he says, religion that is pure and undefiled. Before God, the Father is this to visit orphans and widows in their affliction, and to keep oneself unstained from the world. Notice there is a proactive component here. That proactive component is visiting those that need your care, going to help those that are in need, offering yourself and your turn to someone else. But there's also something that we are to stay away from or to keep unstained. And he says keep oneself unstained from the world. And there the world is the idea of that which is sinful. And so we are to be pure when it comes to those things. And so be active in doing God's word. And that will relate to purity and also a proactive demonstration of love and kindness toward other people. If you're a young person, don't wait for others to do what needs to be done jump in there. You can do a lot and that will go a long way in developing your faith and make sure and making sure that that is your faith and not something someone else's merely told you be active.

Jeremy Sweets  24:32
Not only that, but we need to join a community of believers. As you're in this place. I know that many people are part of this congregation at Broadmoor. But wherever you would go, this should be your desire. And so if you're going to college or going away from your parents, it's important that you join a community of believers that was put there by God for your benefit. In Acts two and verse 242. We see that community of believe was in what they did. It says that they were devoted themselves to the apostles teaching and the fellowship, the breaking of bread and the prayer. They paid attention to the words of God, the teaching of the apostles. And it says that they fellowship together, they have what was common together, they encouraged one another, they broke red remembering the Lord's suffer, and they prayed together, it's important that if we're to have a faith of our own, that we understand that doesn't mean a faith all by ourselves. It means that we make a faith our own, but we do that with other people, with other people that are striving to do the exact same thing. So that we would all come together so that we can overcome our struggles and difficulties and rely upon one another. It's important to be a part of a church, a community of believers, those that are striving to do the same thing you are, that's a blessing given by God and we need to take advantage of it. In Ephesians, four, in verse 12, we read about the fact that he gave the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, the shepherds, and teachers. And he says, to equip the saints, for the work of ministry, for the building up of the Body of Christ, if you want to make faith your own, be a part of a group that regularly meets and encourages you to maintain that faith and grow in your face. passage says that you will be equipped for the work and built. That's what the body of Christ can do, and should be do. And so be a part of that, receive those blessings and give those blessings of encouragement to others join a church or community of believers. Not only that, but you need to listen and talk to God. You know, I've never heard of someone that fell in love with someone else simply by hearing about them. That's not usually how that goes, you don't find two people that simply hear about someone else, and the other one hears about them, and then they fall in love. Now normally, that takes communication together, doesn't it? That takes a relationship that goes through communication, spending time together and being with one another. And so it is with God, it's not enough to hear about him. It's not enough to come to church and be a part of that community of believers and hear someone else talk about God. We need to join that with our own personal time with God. In Philippians, four and verse six, it says do not be anxious about anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication. with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God praying, pray on a regular basis. If you want to make faith your own. This is an essential and important ingredient of that. You need to pray to God on a regular basis. Not only do you need to talk to God, but you need to listen to him and act 17 And verse 11, as it talks about the Jews of Berea it says that are the Christians of Berea they received the word with all eagerness, examining the scriptures daily to see if these things were so they studied God's word, they read God's word, they were looking to God's word. Just as Samuel said, when he heard God calling out to him speak, speak, for your servant listens. We need to be people that are listening to God and to his word seeking after those things. If faith is to be your own, you need to do have personal time with God through reading, studying and listening. And then also talking to God in prayer. If you're going to make faith your own, you need to ask questions, you need to ask questions. Sometimes it's simple when we have someone that has taught us the gospel to simply allow them to answer all the questions we have. Allow them to have the answers and tell us about these things. But if we're to have a faith of our own, we need to ask questions and act 17 verse two.

Jeremy Sweets  29:17
This is prior to what we read in verse 11. There it says Paul went in this is at Thessalonica, as was his custom. And on three Simon's days he reasoned with them from the scriptures, explaining and proving that it was necessary for Christ to suffer and rise from the dead. We see here that Paul says, says that he reasoned with them. That idea of reason goes into dialogue. It goes to providing arguments considering options, it involves using reason and considering things together. Now that will involve proofs and looking to Have to arguments. It also involves some questions that are asked and looking at those things in light of, of Scripture and other things. And so yes, we need to, like Paul did reason from the Scriptures. And I believe that involves looking to things that we're certain about, but also asking questions that we're uncertain about, you know, it's not bad to ask questions. In fact, it's important. It's vital. Sometimes we are around those that seem like they do. Sometimes we're in a situation where we don't see the need for questions. Everybody is doing this this way. But we need to continually go back to God's word, and ask the question, is this what God wants of us? And you can help not only your own faith, but others as you ask questions. Not only that, but don't simply accept the answers without understanding those things. Don't simply allow an answer to go past year. If you have a question, ask that question. Now, don't hold on to doubts. Don't be skeptical in a sense, where you challenge everything in a in a way in which you're not seeking belief. That's not the point of questions. But rather ask questions be inquisitive, seek to know and seek to go to God's word and do that on your own. Don't rely on others to simply supply all the questions, ask questions make sense of your faith. That's important. There are criticisms about Christians that that doesn't happen. There are some people who say Christians don't do that. And in some cases, that may be true, but we need to be active in our faith and ask questions, seek answers, rely upon those that that are older. It may seem like no one's asked this question before, but those that have older probably have asked or have thought about those questions. So seek advice, ask questions, be active in your face. Not only that, but we need to allow allow some room for uncertainty. Sometimes when young people to go to college, they feel like in order to maintain my faith, I have to have an answer for everything. And you may not have an answer for everything. I certainly don't. But there are certain things that I know without a doubt. In first Corinthians two and verse two there, Paul says for I've decided to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ and Him crucified. You may not have an answer for everything your science teacher says. Or you may not have an answer for everything you hear in some kind of philosophy class. But there are things that you can know and you can build on. Paul says, I sought to know Jesus Christ and Him crucified. All other knowledge, I believe, for Paul built out from that foundational fact, the fact that Jesus Christ had died for him, we need to be certain about something. And that will allow us to be uncertain about some other things. If that makes sense. We won't have answers for everything. But when we base our faith upon Jesus Christ and Him crucified, that's okay. We can learn and grow. And maybe over time, we'll come to some of those answers that we have questions about. So ask questions, I

Jeremy Sweets  33:35
believe it's important to your faith. Not only that, but we need to engage others. It may be that by the way that we live, other people will ask us about our faiths. In first Peter three in verse 15. There are Peter says, but in your hearts honor, Christ, the Lord is holy, always being prepared to make a defense to anyone who asked you for a reason for the hope that is in you. Yet do it with gentleness and respect. Paul says, sanctify set apart May Christ holy, treat him as Lord first and your life. And as you do that people will notice a difference. Wait a minute, you're not like everyone else. You're not doing what everyone else is doing. And so you can be prepared, not with a detailed answer that would follow some kind of giant lesson plan for everything that's asked, but you can give an answer for the hope that's in you. Why do you believe? Why do you act the way that you do? And you can tell them about God and what He has done. And so he says, Be prepared to make a defense for the hope that is in you. Let me read on in verse 16. It says having a good conscience so that when you are slandered those who revile your good behavior in Christ may be put to shame their the the idea of engaging others is not only with our words is they would ask questions but also with our godly life. And that's embedded in that concept. They will only ask us about our lives if we are different. So be prepared to be different. Expect that, as people ask questions about that, answer those, but make sure you're living the kind of life that would be different and cause people to ask those questions. So engage others. I mentioned this a couple of other times as well. With the being act of engaging others but but live a godly life. It's hard to have a faith of your own, and yet practice sin. It's hard to have a faith that is rich and growing. And yet you have become consumed by sin and sinful practices. So live a godly life in college freedom. Many people associate with licentiousness and doing whatever it is they want. But that is a destructive path. It is a destructive path. So make faith your own. It may be that you're not a Christian here this morning, and you've never taken the first steps to make your faith your own. You need to believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, confess your sins, repent of your sins, commit your life to Him and be baptized in the water for the forgiveness of your sins. If you're here this morning, and you are a Christian, and you're not living as you should make your life right, you've made a commitment now honor it. And if you need help with that reach out to those here at this congregation or those around your other Christians. You know, there is nothing more important in this life than getting to heaven. And we need to make sure we do everything we can to get there. There's anyone subject to the invitation. Please come as we stand and sing at this time.
