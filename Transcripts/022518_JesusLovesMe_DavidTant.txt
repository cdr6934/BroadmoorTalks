It's good to be with you again. This Sunday. We always enjoy our times with our family here, but also with our larger family, the family and Christ. It's always a pleasure to be with you and I appreciate the opportunity to speak to you this morning. And if you see a couple here that speak with a very heavy accent, then that's our dearest friends from the Philippines. Egeland fade Savio. So once you be sure to greet them, as we're dismissed this morning, many years ago. And a warner wrote a simple little poem called Jesus was me 1860 Probably the best loved and best known hymn ever recorded. It's been translated I don't know how many different languages and songs throughout throughout the earth. And after 160 years, it's still number one children's spiritual song. But it's more than simply a children's song. Because it connects with all ages. It has a message for old and the young as well. One preacher was the fourth to say, everything I ever needed to know about religion I learned from Jesus loves me, this I know. And he may not be too far off in that, because the entire scheme of redemption is found in the different verses of this song. I want us to consider the song this morning. And the lesson that he delivers. And I would like for us to sing the song. Have y'all ever seen it before? Now, I believe so. We'll sing the chorus after the first stanza, and then save the course till after the the last time so sweet will sing with me. Jesus loves

Unknown Speaker  01:55
the sign off. For out he saw lifto One To Him be long. They are weak but He is wrong. The Jesus loves me, he. Jesus loves me. Jesus loves me. And my Bible tells me these Oh, Jesus from his throne on hot came into this world. Mine from Latin God, wrong God free. Jesus loves me he has to open wide, he will wash your way my sin, lead his lips. Jaw calm in. Jesus loves the children, their children faraway and here they are safe with in his air every day and every where Jesus take this heart, mind making your holy vine bled and died for me. Ah I well him for live or he he? Jesus loves me. The Jesus loves me. He loves me. The Bible tells me so

David Tant  04:01
to the first verse there speaks of Divine Love, Revelation and the human need these words Jesus loves me. This I know for the Bible tells me so little wants to Him belong. They are weak, but he is wrong. So the song starts with a very simple acclamation. Jesus loves me, then proceeds to prove it. So how do we know Jesus loves us? The Bible tells me so very clear, very clear. And it's interesting, as far as I know of all the world's religious books, the Quran, the Upanishads, rig, Vedas, whatever it is, the Bible is the only book that tells us that God loves us. The one that in the Quran. Don't find that in the Hindus apana shots, just not there. God tells us through His Word. And where does the Bible say he loves us? John 15, just as the Father has loved me, I've also loved you. Second Corinthians five, for the love of Christ controls us having good this, that one died for all. therefore all died Galatians two, Paul said, I've been crucified with Christ, the longer I live a Christ lives in me. And the life which I now live in the flesh, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved me, and gave himself up for me. So just true to the Scriptures mentioned that they loved, rich young ruler, John 15, Mary and Martha John 11. And their brother Lazarus, and John 11. John, whom we ascertained to be maybe the closest in a physical relationship to Christ, that he's maybe loved him, especially several places. And then you read about the disciples in John 13, through 1731 times 31 times, this idea is mentioned, of the love that he had for his disciples. Look at all these places here just so much as you read through the Gospel of John, which is a little bit different than the Synoptic Gospels, and it must focus on this idea of the love that he had for us. And the song then points to human need little ones and belong. They are weak, but he is wrong. We are weak because we sin, and we sin because we are weak. Remember that Peter, I was admonished by Jesus, to pray. Keep watching and pray that you may not enter into temptation. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak. I read of a touching story that I'd like to share with you. Phyllis Xenos life was changed one day when the department Human Resources brought a dutiful but troubled little girl into her care into her daycare Academy. Little girl was born in prison to a mother who was addicted to drugs during all of her pregnancy. And this little child had no emotional control. She'd never spoke, she never spoke. And when you would approach her she would fall to the ground and become in a fetal position and begin crying. Daily Fil A sat with her rocking her in a rocking chair and she would sing to her. Jesus loves me that all seem to calm the little child and a peaceful look with him over face. One day after a really particularly difficult day, Phyllis held her silently rocking in the chair and the troubled girl looked up to her tears and said Sing to me about the man who loves me. Sing to me about the man who loves me. Yes, Jesus was the children. Second verse and speaks of the incarnation and crucifixion, as Jesus from your throne on high came into the world to die, that I might from sin be free, bled and died upon the tree. One of the well known phrases we see in Scripture is Greater love has no man than this, than one lay down his life for his friends and John 15. a Vietnam veteran Air Force Colonel John Mansur tells about an eight year old orphan who'd been wounded by border fire and was in danger of losing her life unless he received a blood transfusion.

David Tant  08:55
No of the medical personnel had her type of blood. But some of the Vietnamese children in the orphanage did have her type of blood. And so in his pidgin English with a nurses smattering of high school French, the doctor explained to the children that someone needed to give some blood to help this little girl to live. He asked who'd be willing. The children all looked around with a wide eyed silence. After several seconds, a hand went up and then went round. And then it went up again. Oh, thank You that said what's your name? Hang hangs on was quickly swamped, and a needle inserted into his vein. At first he lay there steel and solid then began sobbing. He covered his face and shame with a fist in his mouth. And his songs turned to Sonic crime of Vietnam his nurse arrived and seeing his distress. She spoke rapidly and listened and answered in a very soothing voice. He stopped crying, and had a false look on his face. When she nodded, relief sprayed over his face. She then said to the Americans, he misunderstood. He thought he was dying. He had to, he thought he had to give all his blood to save her. After the thoughtful silence, the nurse I asked, why would he be willing to do that? The translator asked him, and he said, She's my friend. He was willing to give up his life for his friend. Paul wrote about this very thing in Romans the fifth chapter, for what we were still helpless at the right time Christ died for the ungodly. For one will hardly die for a righteous man, though perhaps for a good man, someone would even dare to die. But God demonstrates His own love toward us. And while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. While we were yet sinners, Christ died for us. John 114, and the Word became flesh and dwelt among us. And we beheld, we beheld his glory, glory as of the only begotten from the Father, full of grace, and truth. And the culmination of that love was the substitution of Christ on the cross. He bled, and died upon the tree. His biographers record history's greatest event in very subdued language, Luke 23, when they came to the place called us go, there they crucified him and the criminals were on the right, on the other on the left. To me, this is an indication of the divine inspiration of the scriptures. If this Romina told from a human standpoint, they will have chapter after chapter after chapter describing all the gruesome things, but a very specific language. God has given us the story. Verse three talks about salvation and hope. Jesus loves me He who died Heaven's Gate to open wide, he will wash away my sin. Let his little child come in. The cross shows just how much God loved us. In the most, probably the most memorized verse in the Bible would be John 316. For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life. Jesus, love provided a way to let his little child come in. John 14, six, Jesus said, I am the way and the truth on the life. No one comes to the Father, but through me.

David Tant  13:32
Romans, the fifth chapter, much more than having not been justified by His blood, we shall be saved from the wrath of God through Him. For if, while we were enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of his Son, much more hadn't been reconciled, we shall be saved by his wife. And this involves the idea of washing away by sin. There's only one cleanser that can remove my sin and the sin from every person who ever lived on the face of the earth. That is, God's lamb. Revelation one five, and from Jesus Christ, the faithful witness, the firstborn, the dad and the ruler of the kings of the earth. To him who loves us and release us from our sins by His blood. First Peter one, knowing that you are not redeemed with perishable things like silver or gold from your funeral way of life inherited from your forefathers, but with precious blood, as of a lamb unblemished and spotless, the blood of Christ. God applies this gold cleansing blood to our bodies and axles. As our bodies are washed in water and saw was sold. Why you delay? Get up and bigger dies and wash away you're saying is calling on his name. A fuller picture of how this process works is given to us by the apostle Paul in Galatians. In Romans, the sixth chapter, do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus had been baptized into his death. Therefore we've been buried with Him through baptism into death, so that as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, so we too, might walk in newness of life. For have we become united with Him in the likeness of His death, certainly, we should also be in the likeness of His resurrection, knowing this, that our old self was crucified with Him, in order that our body of sin might be done away with so that we should no longer be slaves to sin. Baptism is a perfect representation of Christ, dying on the cross, being buried in the ground, and then being raised on the third day, as we take that old man of sin and we crucify that and put that old man under the water, a bail in water, and then raised to walk in a new life. Verse four gives us assurance and comfort. Jesus loves to your children, children far away and near. They are safe within his care. Every day. And everywhere. Jesus loves children, far away and near. His love is as boundless as space, as wide as the ocean, as limitless as of the sky. Every race, religion, rank, color, caste, class, climate, sex station fried is love carries it all. Come unto me all you who are weary and heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you and learn from me for I am gentle and humble in heart. And you will find rest your souls Hebrews two nine, but we do see him who was made for a little while longer than the angels, namely Jesus, and because of the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honor, so that by the grace of God, he might taste of death for everyone. And he wants the message to go to all. So then air through one transgression, their results and condemnation to all men, even sold through one act of righteousness that resulted justification of life to all men. He died for all great commission told the disciples and Mark 16 Go into all the world and preach the gospel to all creation.

David Tant  17:59
They have pity cost for them marvelous day. And notice those that were present Parthians Medes Elamites people from Mesopotamia, Judea, Cappadocia, Pontius and Asia frigid and Philea. Egypt, from Libya, serene Rome, cretins and Arabs, 16 different nations represented here. They've come to Jerusalem, for the annual Feast of Pentecost. And here the Jews from all over the known world. They were there. And the gospel was proclaimed on that day. Appreciate the remarks made before the collection about the work that you do here and the spread of the gospel not only here, but throughout the world. And here's just an example. The church we work with in Roswell, Georgia. We have either supported men in these places, send others to those places, or they've sent me for and myself. And that's how we came to meet this Avios 20 years ago, when we first went to the Philippines. We live in an age unprecedented as to our ability to travel throughout the world and send money throughout the world. My grandfather JD Ted was a very well known pioneer preacher back in the late 1800s and early 19. Going through some stuff the other day I found his passport. He went to Cuba in 1922 breech. So how do you go to Cuba in 1920 there was a railroad from Miami down to key waves that by Flagler it's no longer there that got the Overseas Highway. But I'm sure my grandfather got a train and rode down to Key West and then caught a boat crosses Havana some 90 miles away. Yes, there were people interested in going to other parts of the world, even back then. But now notice in Colossians 123 As far as Watch if indeed you continue in the faith firmly established and steadfast and not moved away from the hope of the gospel that you've heard which was proclaimed in all creation under heaven, on which I Paul was made a minister. Okay, this is written some 30 years after Pentecost one generation. Visual the Gospels spread to the whole world, the whole known world. No internet, no TV. No radio transmission. No fast travel, you can travel on a camel about 20 miles a day. How did all this happen? How this is just amazing as to how this all took place, so quickly. What do you remember, on the day of Pentecost with those 16 nations represented there? And they stayed in Jerusalem for a time to be taught to be instructed. And now Okay, it's time to go home. It's time to go home. Stephen preached a powerful sermon and X seven. He was stoned to death. X eight says that the persecution began in Jerusalem and the dissolve all scattered abroad. Okay, it's time to go home. They maxed out the credit cards, ATM machines are empty. They don't have any more money in them. So it's time to go home. And the people from the 60 nations wherever they went later, the good news with them. It wasn't the preachers. It says these bots will say to Jerusalem. Of course in time they did go out. But here's what individual Christians did. wherever they went. They spread the news to the next door neighbor to the drugstore clerk to the fellow who filled up their camel with hay or whatever, you know, they stopped in to get field you know, whatever. What. So what does that say about us? Our opportunities, our responsibilities. It's not just for the preachers. For every child of God revelation five nine, they sang a new song sang Worthy are you to take the book and to break it seals for you are slain and purchase for God with your blood being from every tribe and tongue and people and nation. Jews, Samaritans Gentiles, Ethiopians, Europeans, Romans,

David Tant  22:38
you go through the book of Acts and see the missionary journeys, and how the word spread in one generation, the whole known world, slave within his care every day and everywhere, who will bring a charge against God's elect. God is the one who justifies who is the one who condemns Christ Jesus, as he who died, gay revenue was raised who was at the right hand of God, who also intercedes for us, Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Will tribulation, or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or peril or sword? Just as it is written, for your sakes, we're being put to death all day long. We consider the sheep to be slaughtered. But then look, If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins, to cleanse us of all unrighteousness because we are safe within his care, every day, and everywhere, as Peter says, the weird to cast all right anxiety on him. Because he cares for you. Here's a good verse. Remember, verse 1030, No temptation has overtaken you, but such as those common demand. And God is faithful, who will not allow you to be tempted beyond what you are able, but will with a temptation provide the wave escape also, so that you will be able to endure it. That's God's promise. He knows each one of us, we all have our different strengths and weaknesses. And God knows every bit of it. He said, I promise I will not allow you to be tempted beyond your ability to bear it. That we may go ahead and give in and yield a limitation now because we couldn't help it because we made the decision to do so. So you all love need to remember a comedian on TV named Philip Wilson. Yeah, have those results. His favorite saying was the devil made me do it. They wouldn't make him do anything. We make a decision or so. cells do not fear those who kill the body but are able to kill the soul but rather fear he was able to destroy both soul and body. Inhale Matthew 1028. First Corinthians 1538 therefore my beloved brethren, be steadfast, unmovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that your toil is not in vain in the Lord. We may not see the results immediately of what we do for the Lord. We might even become discouraged a bit, but God knows. And he says that our labor will not be in vain. That word abounding is also translated overflowing. Take a glass and put it under the faucet and just turn the faucet on, it feels gonna begin to overflow. That's what should describe our labor in the Lord bless it is the man who perseveres under trial for once he has been approved, he received the crown of life which the Lord has promised to those who love Him. We are blessed if we persevere. Some of you remember may remember a fellow named Charles Atlas only five others. Charles Atlas back a generation ago, who was a grown man, he weighed 97 pounds. Had no girlfriend girls robbing fun on him. I'm gonna do something about that. He began a rigorous program of exercise a diet eventually became Mr. America. I cannot quite imagine the pain he went through all the exercise and all this to build his body up. But he looked for the reward. That's what he says here. We persevere under trial, because we look for the reward. We know what lies ahead of us. The Lord is not slow about his promises as some count slowness, but is patient toward you not wishing for any to perish. But for all to come to repentance, second, Peter three nine, he will help us if that's the reward that we want.

David Tant  27:33
First, why the Christians life. Jesus take this heart of mine make it pure and holy, Thine that was bled and died for me. I will henceforth live for the Fall room set gradients five, He died for all so that they who live might no longer live for themselves. But for him who died and rose again on their behalf. The most important command given is a summation of all of God's commands, which is usual Love the Lord your God with all your heart with all your soul with all your mind. This is the great and first commandment. And the second like dude is this. You should love your neighbor as yourself and Matthew 22. And in spite of what many say that they that loving God, loving God also involves obeying God. I know so many people that I've talked to so I love God, I love God. But they shouldn't have interest in following what he said. It's one thing to sing. Jesus loves me. But another is saying, Oh how I love Jesus. And how do we love Jesus? John 1415 If you love me, you will keep My commandments. So we're sure that we mean what we say when we act upon what we've said.

David Tant  29:10
crowbar was a noted scholar in recent history theologian. He was in Chicago giving a lecture to several fellow theologist students. And after his lecture, someone asked him about your greatest theological discovery. And they expected some great deep you know, insight that he would say he thought a minute. He said the greatest theologians I've ever had as Jesus loves me this I know for the Bible tells me so. Well, that's on the roll up. So I'm sure they were a little bit surprised about that. And Jesus loves you Just as much as you love Peter and John, Mary and Martha and he loves you so much that he would have died for you, if you were the only person who ever lived on the face of the earth. Let me be a little bit harder for some of us to comprehend. I'm not worth that much. I mean, they're not worth anybody dying for me, much less the soul of God. And we think, Okay, let's take all the billions of people who ever lived on the face of the earth and put them all in one big back pile there and okay, we can maybe conceive of God dying for all of those.

David Tant  30:43
But Jeremy was the only person who ever lived on the face of the earth. Price would have died for him.

David Tant  30:54
Just Just think about that a minute.

David Tant  31:03
If Shannon was the only person who ever lived on the face of the earth, Christ would have died for her. And he did this because he wants to save each one of us from the fires of hell. And bring us to heaven to live with Him eternally. I hope that's what you want. If you're not a part of God's family, will you hear His voice? Even today? The very simplest terms Jesus said he believes and advertised, shall we say, is the one who need to respond to God's call, if you will come as we stand together and sang the song of invitation
