Have you ever said that you would never do something. And then months or years or maybe days later you find yourself doing that exact thing. Maybe that's not the best way to word it. So a couple of simple examples would be in my life, I can think back to specific times when there was a new fashion trend that came out. And maybe I saw a friend wear it, and I thought, that looks terrible, I will never wear that. Then everyone else started wearing it. And then I was like, you know, that doesn't look too bad. And before you know it, I would be wearing that exact thing. And if you want to know what it is, I can tell you later in private. Or before I had kids, I remember when I remember specifically saying, when I have kids, I will never let the television babysit my kids. Well, then I had a two year old and then I had two kids, and I had to had three kids. And then just yesterday, I turned on the TV. So I could work on this sermon that I'm giving you tonight. It wasn't sudden, but slowly over time, I began to accept something that once seemed bad or repulsive to me. Of course, there are more serious examples. I can think of some times in my life where I committed a sin. And I said, I will never do that again. And then I found myself doing that same thing again, maybe just weeks later. Or maybe you've known someone, a husband or wife who made a vow, to someone that they love more than anyone in the world. They said I will never forsake you, I will never cheat on you. But their marriage falls apart because of adultery. How do we get so far into something that we once thought of as awful or disgusting? You may have guessed, but tonight, we're going to talk about Peter. So if you want to open your Bibles, we're going to look at Mark chapter 14. And just for a minute, in just a minute. I'm thankful for this opportunity to speak in front of you tonight, I only get this opportunity maybe once every other year, because we have so many men here who are able

Kyle Mcdonald  02:17
to speak in a in a setting like this. And when Kurt asked me to preach in February, I had no idea I would be following David tant. But I'm grateful for this opportunity. And he actually hit on this subject a little bit this morning. But we'll get a little bit more in depth on it today. So beginning and Mark 14, verses 26. And when they had sung a hymn, they went out to the Mount of Olives, and Jesus said to them, you will all fall away, for it is written, I will strike the shepherd and the sheep will be scattered. But after I'm raised up, I will go before you to Galilee, Peter said to Him, even though they all fall away, I will not. And Jesus said to him, Truly I tell you this very night before the rooster crows twice, you will deny me three times. But he said emphatically, if I must die with you, I will not deny you. And they all said the same. And they went to a place called guest seminary and he said to his disciples sit here while I pray. And he took with him Peter, and James and John and began to be greatly distressed and troubled. And he said to them, My soul is very sorrowful even to death remain here and watch. And going a little farther he fell on the ground and prayed that if it were possible, the hour might pass from him. And he said Abba Father, all things are possible for you remove this cup from me not as yet not what I will but what you will. And he came and found them sleeping and he said to Peter Simon, are you asleep? Could you not watch one hour? Watch and pray that you may not enter into temptation, the spirit indeed is willing but the flesh is weak. And again, he went away and prayed and saying the same words and again he came and found them sleeping for their eyes were heavy, and they did not know what to answer him. And he came the third time and said to them Are you still sleeping and taking your rest is enough? The hour has come the Son of Man has betrayed into the hands of sinners. Rise let us be going see my betrayers at hand. And immediately while he was still speaking, Judas came on skipping down through the arrest verse 53. And they led Jesus to the high priest and all the chief priests and the elders and the scribes came together. And Peter had followed him at a distance right into the courtyard of the high priest and he was sitting with the guards and warming himself at the fire. Now the chief priests in the whole council were seeking testimony against Jesus to put him to death. But they found on Skipping down to verse 65, and some began to spit on Him and to cover his face and strike him saying to him, prophesy, and the guards received him with blows. And as Peter was below in the courtyard, one of the servant girls or the high priest, came and seeing Peter warming himself. She looked at him and said, You also were with Nazarene and The Nazarene Jesus, but he denied it saying I neither know nor understand what you mean. And he went out into the gateway and the rooster crowed. In the servant girls saw him and began to say again to the bystanders, this man is one of them. But again, he denied it. And after a little while, the bystanders again said to Peter, certainly you are one of them, for you are a Galilean. But he began to invoke a curse on himself and to swear, I do not know this man of whom you speak, and immediately the rooster crowed a second time. And Peter remembered how Jesus had said to him, before the rooster crows twice, he will deny me three times, and he broke down and wept. Peter may have considered himself to be Jesus, most faithful follower, he loved Jesus. He had seen the miracles, He saw him walk on the water. So I'm raised people from the dead. He saw the transfiguration. He knew that Jesus was the most incredible person to ever live, in that he was God's son, and he couldn't imagine ever doing anything to hurt Jesus. In fact, he said, I will not fall away, even if everyone else does. He was willing to die for him. And at first he was right, he had the courage to fight we know from another account, he cut off a god's ear. But as Jesus was led away from a garden, he slowly distanced himself from Jesus reminds me of when he decided to walk on the water with Jesus, he started off boldly. But then he quickly began to doubt in lost faith. When he was asked, if he was Jesus's follower, he denied three times first. It was a calm denial to me anyway, it was a I don't really know what you're talking about. And then he got, you know, more stern as he went, he continued to not deny, and then he emphatically swore, and said he would be cursed. If he was lying. He was willing to die for Jesus, I believe that. But he wasn't willing to be embarrassed for him. And then Peter, remember what Jesus said, and he broke down. And so what lessons can we learn from Peter? How can we avoid falling into doing something that we would never want to do?

Kyle Mcdonald  07:14
I think we could look to a few different things. But I think what Jesus said in verses 37, and 38, is helpful. He said, Simon, are you asleep? Could you not watch one hour, watch and pray that you may not enter into temptation? The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak. Peter could avoid temptation by watching and praying. And when crisis came, he was caught off guard. He wasn't watching and he wasn't praying, and his faith was shaken. So what about us, our spirit is usually willing, I'm usually wanting to do the right thing, but my flesh is often weak. So what happens to us if we're spiritually asleep? And can we better avoid temptation if we're watching and praying, so first I want to talk about watchfulness. ruin the surprise. watchfulness is defined is being carefully observant or attentive. Some synonyms that we see in Scripture are being sober, vigilant, focused, Alert, Aware. So we need to be watchful and aware of something. So I'm going to talk about three things that we need to be aware of. And the first is we need to be aware of ourselves, and that is our own weaknesses. Peter, and the apostles all had a false sense of confidence in themselves. He said, Even if everyone else falls away, I never will. But he was unaware of his own weakness. Maybe his overconfidence was because he had never denied Jesus before. So he thought it wouldn't happen now. Or maybe it was because he had never really had a difficult time or Jesus never let anything terrible happened to himself or to his apostles. And that allowed him to fall asleep instead of watching and praying. We heard this morning that we are weak because we sin and we sin, because we are weak. What if Peter had recognized his own weaknesses? What would he have done differently? Would he have begged Jesus for strength? Instead of saying, I'm not going to do that. In the same way, we must be careful to not allow our success or our lack of difficulty in our life to lead to overconfidence or pride in ourselves. Maybe you've been a Christian for a long time, 1020 30 years. And you've never faced this situation so difficult that you fell away. But that doesn't mean that it won't ever happen. So we need to be watching and praying. Maybe you've been married for 1520 30 years, and your marriage has never really gone through a rough patch and you've never fallen apart. But that doesn't mean that it can't. Maybe you've gone to For years without committing a certain sin that used to struggle with, but that doesn't mean that you're out of the woods yet. And you can't struggle again with that or something else. Proverbs 1618 says, Pride goes before destruction, and a haughty spirit before a fall. If we're overly confident in our own strength, we will surely fall. So we need to be careful. Brothers, if anyone is caught in any transgression, you who are spiritual should restore him in a spirit of gentleness, keep watch on yourselves, lest you to be tempted. Therefore, let anyone who thinks he stands take heed, lest he fall, the Bible is filled with examples. So many of them in the Old Testament that I'm not even going to mention, many of them have people who fell when they thought they couldn't. But it just goes to show that it could happen to anyone. So we must be carefully watching ourselves. So we don't fall when difficult situations arise. So we also need to be aware of these difficult situations that do arise. Trials, temptations, I know they're not the same, but a lot of times they go hand in hand. It didn't take Peter, long for him to begin to distance himself from Christ. He started off bold. But he was completely caught off guard when something difficult came along. And he slowly began to distance himself, his will was there, but the strength was not. He had plenty of strength when things were easy. But when things got tough, he was weak. How many of us overestimate our own strength, but we underestimate the strength of temptation, we overestimate our strength and underestimate the power of temptation. Not only do we need to recognize that we are weak, but we need to recognize that temptation is strong, and that they will surely come in the parable of the soils, we see that those seeds that fell on the rocky ground, they started off great. But it says when temptation came, they fell away.

Kyle Mcdonald  12:09
Or when tribulation or persecution. And then in James chapter one, we see that when you meet trials of various kinds, counted all joy, for you know that the testing of your faith, produces steadfastness. And let steadfastness have its full effect that you may be perfect and complete, lacking in nothing. Yes, God will not allow us to be tempted beyond our ability. But he will allow us to be tempted, He will allow trials to come and is sure that they will come for all of us. We heard this morning we persevere under trial, because we look to the reward. In the third and final things. thing we need to be watchful of, is our enemy. Peter himself warns us of our enemy and how we need to be watchful of him. In First Peter chapter five, in verse six through 11, humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, so that at the proper time, he may exalt you, Casting all your anxieties on Him because He cares for you. Be sober minded, be watchful, your adversary, the devil, prowls around like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour. Resist him firm in your faith, knowing that the same kinds of suffering are being experienced by your brotherhood throughout the world. Not only do we have an enemy, but we have an enemy who is seeking to destroy us. Imagine if there were actual lions roaming around Nashville. I can't imagine that ever happening. But but just imagine if it could happen. What? How would we act? We would be very alert and very cautious. Anytime we went outdoors to do anything or go anywhere. We wouldn't just go outside and take a nap in the yard. We wouldn't let our kids go out and play by themselves, we would be very careful. And the truth is, there are dangers far worse in this world. We have a much more powerful enemy who wants to destroy us. I guess a lion could get fooled. But our enemy never gets full. He never quits. And we need to be mentally alert and aware of this danger is if align we're looking for us. You see Satan wants us to fall away. He wants our marriages to fall apart. He wants us to lie. He wants us to gossip about one another. He wants us to quarrel with each other. He wants us to lust to have greed. He wants us to sin and He will come to tempt us. And it may be in a way or at a time that we don't expect. Peter was caught unaware. And we need to be watching for our enemy. Satan. He's cunning and he's deceptive. He won't come immediately and ask us to do something terrible that we've never come close to doing before. He's not gonna asked me to go out and commit mass murder, he's not going to tempt me to go out and rob a bank. He's just not immediately. He didn't ask Peter to go to war for Jesus, I think Peter would have gone to war, I think he would have stood in on trial for Jesus. But it wasn't that he, Peter was approached by a servant girl, if he believed, and he just kind of shook it off was one small thing at a time, and then it spirals downhill from there. What happens when you take a break, or, or you just break one rule in a diet, or maybe you have one bad day where you you eat some donuts and some cake. If you're not careful to get back on track in your diet, it'll spiral downhill after that, and you just give up completely. And in the same way, Satan is going to go after one little weakness in us whether it's pride or anger, or lust, or jealousy, or a fear of being embarrassed. And you will try to expose that and hopes to lead us down a path to somewhere we thought we'd never go. So we need to be aware of our enemy who was real, who's powerful, who's coming in seeking to destroy us. So next, we need to pray. How does prayer go with watchfulness? How does it make us more watchful? And how does it help us avoid or overcome temptation? Well, first, I want to recognize that prayer humbles us. If we need to watch for pride within ourselves, if we need to watch for our own weaknesses, we need humility. And when we go to God in prayer, just the physical posture alone of bowing your head to God is humbling. And then you think about, I'm talking to the God of the universe, the God who created the world. A God is perfect and holy. You praise him for that. And then you think about how imperfect you are, and how weak I am.

Kyle Mcdonald  17:05
And how I prone to fall in how helpless I am. And what it does is it forces us to trust God. We just read in first Peter five, and I'll go back to it. You see this part highlighted in red is Be sober minded, be watchful, you know, resist the devil. What's mentioned very first in this passage, humble yourselves and cast your anxieties on him. That's prayer, humbling yourself before God, and casting your anxieties on him. Cons before being watchful, and being sober minded, and being able to resist the devil. This point is also reemphasized over in James chapter four, verses six through 10, where it says, Therefore it says God opposes the proud, but gives grace to the humble. Submit yourself, therefore to God, resist the devil, and he will flee from you. Draw near to God, and He will draw near to you. And in verse 10, humble yourselves before the Lord, and He will exalt you. If we submit to God, and resist the devil, he will flee from us, submit to God, and resist the devil, and he will flee. So we need to pray in order. Because in order to be watchful, and in order to resist the devil, we need to be humble. Secondly, prayer gives us strength. If our spirit is willing to overcome trials, but our flesh is unable to our flesh is too weak, we need to find strength somewhere. So where can we find the power, the strength to overcome these trials and remain focused on our mission? I think we could look to the example of Jesus and see it clearly. He went to the wilderness to pray before he began his mission, his ministry on this earth. We see him waking up early in the morning, to pray before he began his day. And we see him going to the garden to pray as we just read about when he was about to undergo something so significant, so challenging, that he needed perfect focus on his mission. And all of those times. He found strength in prayer. I think we can all think of personal examples. Of course, prayer gave us strength to get through something. You all encouraged me so much. Over the last few months, and even a few years ago, we were going through something difficult. But it means a lot when people are praying for you. I was overwhelmed by the number of cards I received. Not just the encouragement of knowing that people care, but I could feel God helping us get through these different things. And I know that what I've gone through is nothing compared to what some of you have, but I know that you can relate to this. Luke chapter 21, Jesus knew that his disciples were going to have to go through some pretty difficult things. And he tells them to be watchful, and he tells them to pray. He says, but watch yourselves, lest your hearts be weighed down with dissipation and drunkenness and cares of this life. And that day come upon you suddenly, like a trap, for it will come upon all who dwell on the face of the earth, but stay awake at all times, praying that you may have strength to escape all these things that are going to take place and to stand before the Son of Man. Prayer is an essential part of being watchful, of being sober minded. And it is where we find strength. Yes, we need to pray during times of temptation. But it's more important to be awake and to be praying at all times. Jesus told us how to pray, or when he told us how to pray, he said, lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. And if we aren't regularly praying, if we aren't beginning and ending our days, with prayer, are we really focused on our mission? Will we find strength when times of crisis come? So let's follow his example. And pray for strength. Lastly, we need to pray for and seek wisdom. Wisdom is required in defeating Satan. Wisdom is defined as having is the quality of having experience, knowledge and good judgment. Wisdom is defined as having experience, knowledge and good judgment. Have you ever been really, really sleepy while you're driving on the road late at night, your eyes start to get heavy seems like every blank, you get a little short nap in there and you just crave your bed. Someone who is foolish or someone who's not wise may think, you know, I've never fallen asleep at the wheel before so.

Kyle Mcdonald  22:02
So I'll be fine tonight. But somebody who is wise, because they have wisdom will say I need to take a break, I need to pull over take a nap, I need to get someone else to drive I need to get some coffee, stretch my legs, whatever. Because they have wisdom. They have knowledge. They have good judgment. They have experience they've seen other people fall into this trap of falling asleep while they're at the wheel. So wisdom can keep us alive on the roads. But it can also keep us safe from Satan's traps, like a lion from that lion who's seeking to devour us. We see this proven over and over again in the Proverbs and I didn't put one on the screen because I couldn't pick just one. But I'm just going to read a little bit from Proverbs three, verses 21. And following my son do not lose sight of these keep sound wisdom and discretion. And they will be life for your soul and adornment for your neck. Then you will walk on your waist securely and your foot will not stumble. If you lie down. You will not be afraid. When you lie down your sleep will be sweet. Do not be afraid of sudden tear of the ruin of the wicked when it comes for the Lord will be your confidence. It will keep your foot from being caught. And then over in chapter four verses beginning verse five, get wisdom get insight do not forget and do not turn away from the words of my mouth. Do not forsake her and she will keep you love her and she will guard you. The beginning of wisdom is this Get wisdom and whatever you get get inside, prize her highly and she will exalt you, she will honor you. If you embrace her, she will place on your head a graceful garland, she will bestow on you a beautiful crown here my son and accept my words, that the years of your life may be many. And I could just keep going on. But we see that wisdom is important to have because it protects us. Wisdom keeps us safe. So where do we find wisdom? Well, I just mentioned it, we need to pray for it. If any of you lack wisdom, let him ask God who gives graciously to all without reproach, and it will be given to him. We need to search for wisdom in the world. And we need to look to others for wisdom. There are a lot of people who are wiser than I am. And I've learned over the years that I need to look to others for example, for guidance, I need to learn from others mistakes from their successes. I need to ask questions, and I need to study. Just within these four walls. We have so many people who could serve as examples as mentors. I can think of times in my life when I went to one of our elders here into his wife and asked for some wisdom and how to raise one of my children in a certain way. And the advice that I received though that Kayla and I received was so helpful. They were able to give us perspective. We were focused on the here and now and you know, how will this change our lives today, but this elder was able to look back, you know, over their lives and over raising their children. And to give us perspective, and that was encouraging, it was refreshing, and it was a blessing. So when we look to the word into others for wisdom, we can see that why is Christians don't put themselves in situations to where they can become more comfortable with Siri. You may recall a year or two ago, our Vice President Mike Pence, came out and said that he won't be in a situation or he and his wife agreed that they won't go to dinner with someone of the opposite sex. And furthermore, he won't be anywhere where alcohol is served unless his wife is present. And he received a lot of ridicule for this. It was in the news it was in social media. People said you don't respect women, you have no self control if you can't be alone with a woman for more than a few minutes. But our Vice President recognized what was most important in his life was his marriage. And he needed needed to set some guardrails for it to protect himself. from Satan, he recognized that his flesh that all man's flesh is weak, and that we do have an enemy. I'm gonna read a quote from someone wrote this article for the Indianapolis Star. He says, I never thought this would happen to me. Those were the words of a close friend when he revealed to me that he was having an affair and that he was leaving his wife. They were just friends who met for lunch, but over time, friendship led to flattery which led to flirtation which led to infidelity, and ended in divorce. Well, I have a confession to make,

Kyle Mcdonald  26:57
I have always feared that it would happen to me. And because my I love my wife of 37 years, I like Mike Pence set up boundaries to protect my heart and my marriage. And he goes on to say later he says there are three reasons. The pence rule is wise. One, it protects your spouse. Trust is vital in a relationship takes away opportunities to sin, and there's no reason to worry, too. It protects your reputation. And three, it protects your heart. So we see wisdom and just this one decision. I know many other people besides Mike Pence hold these hold these views. But we can see wisdom. In this wisdom says I'm not going to put myself in a situation where I'll be tempted to commit adultery, do not desire her beauty in your heart and do not let her capture you with her eyelashes can a man carry fire next to his chest and his clothes not be burned. Furthermore, we see from his example and others that wisdom says I'm going to avoid alcohol. There's nothing in Well, in my opinion, inherently wrong in alcohol, it's not going to kill you just a little bit. But there are so many warnings in Scripture against alcohol. Because it takes away our awareness. It takes away our sobriety. It wisdom says to avoid it. Wine is a mocker strong drink is a brawler, and whoever is led astray by It is not wise. And thirdly from this example, I see that wisdom says that I'm going to choose a spouse and I'm gonna choose to associate with people who are going to help me get to heaven, not ones who make me more comfortable with sin. The Israelites were not to intermarry with the nations around them, because God knew in his wisdom, that they would be led down a path to idolatry, if they were to be closely joined with peep with the nations around them. And similarly, you know, our Vice President, he knew that his wife would hold him accountable in situations where alcohol is, is being served. First Corinthians 15 Verse 33 says, Do not be deceived, Bad company corrupts good morals. If we think we can be around sin and be close to sin and not affect us were deceived. First Thessalonians warns us to be awake to be sober, because we belong to the day. We don't belong to the night. We don't put our situate ourselves in situations where we'll be tempted. And there's so many more examples that we could go on to talk about about wisdom. You know, I'm not going to watch movies or be around people who use bad language because I don't need to become more comfortable with that language. I'm not gonna take a job or move somewhere where I can't worship with brethren because I don't need to become okay with not being around other Christians. wisdom says if my eye is going to sin, I'm going to pluck it out. And that means whatever it is that contempt me, I'm going to stay away from it. Whether that's lust, or greed, or jealousy, I'm going to remove myself from any situation that could lead me into sin. So what steps are we taking today? To ensure that we don't become ensnared by Satan's traps? Are we carefully observant on ourselves looking for pride and weakness? Are we aware that trials will come? In? Are we looking for our enemy? Are we aware that he will come? Are we praying for humility? And for strength? Are we seeking wisdom? We need to look for look to others examples, both good and bad. We need to be careful not to put ourselves in situations where we become more comfortable with sin. So what if we do feel like Peter did? What if we found out find ourselves in a place where we never thought we would be? Well, I'm thankful the example of Peter didn't in there. That's kind of where the example of Judas ended. But Peter didn't, didn't let that into his life, he responded. So first, he recognized what he did. And we need to recognize that sin separates us from God that it's serious, even if it's a small sin, it's a sin, and it could lead us to somewhere we don't want to go again. So we need to recognize that it separates us from God to he was hurt. Imagine how Peter felt after he denied Jesus, and he just saw that pain and that hurt in Jesus's face. So similarly, our sins should hurt us, not only because they separate us from God, but because they can hurt the ones we love. Because they get hurt the church, and they hurt our Lord.

Kyle Mcdonald  31:53
And finally, Peter, learn from his failure and use it as pain, use his pain as motivation to serve Jesus more fully. So if you're not a Christian tonight, will you come confessing your sins, repenting or confessing your faith and repenting of your sins and being baptized? Or if you fallen, and you've sinned, and you find yourself in a place where you never thought you would be when you turn around? And go back to God? You see, no sin is too sinful for God forgive. He knows that our flesh is weak. And that's why He gave us His Son so that we might have a way. So won't you repent and be motivated to serve God and lead others to him? I'm going to end with a scripture from Psalm 51. Hide your face from my sins and blot out my iniquities created me a clean heart, O God and renew a right spirit within me. Cast me not away from your presence, and take not your Holy Spirit from me. Restore to me the joy of your salvation and uphold a willing spirit. Then I will teach transgressors your ways, and sinners will return to you. If you have any need tonight once you've come on, we stand and sing the invitation song
