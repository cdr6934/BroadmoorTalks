I want to publicly say thank you to the elders for the opportunity to speak here, but also to the church, this search is very special to me. And you guys have been very, very good to me and my family. And I just want to say thank you. And if you're visiting, and you've never been here before, or you're sort of checking these people out, for what it's worth, considering you don't know me either. Maybe, I don't know. Maybe you do. I don't know. But they're, they're wonderful people. Wonderful, wonderful people. Except that guy over there. No, I'm just kidding. I'm joke guys point out the wall. I wasn't funny at anybody. I don't know if you've ever noticed. But sometimes, the most pivotal moments in our life can be traced back to a single conversation we've had with somebody, maybe not even very long. That's the way it is, for me at least. And many people I know, trace Pivotal, life changing moments, where they had an epiphany or where all of a sudden their heart was changed or they felt understood. They felt validated, whatever it is, things can change quickly in a conversation. And what I want to do right now is ask you to turn with me to what some people have called the most famous conversation in history. Go with me to Genesis, I'm sorry, the book of John chapter three. John, chapter three. This is a conversation. This is the conversation where Jesus says what what many people know as John 316. This is the conversation where, at least according to Scripture, this is where Jesus first introduces the idea of being born again. And this is the conversation taking place at night. A Pharisee, who was called a leader of the Jews comes to Jesus to his house at night, maybe to stay away from the crowds, maybe because he was afraid of scrutiny. Maybe you never know. But it was dangerous. They didn't have street lights like we have powered by electricity. Nighttime is when the robbers came out. So I'm inclined to think the general assumption we may have about the risk that people would have by going out at night was less than what he thought the risk would be of talking to Jesus in daylight, especially considering his position. So let's read but the kiss the message though, it was important for him to speak to Jesus, and Jesus shares things that in this conversation, have the power to change anybody's life. If we have ears that hear. So beginning in verse one. It reads, now there was a man of the Pharisees, named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews. This man came to Jesus by night and said to him, Rabbi, we know that you have come from God, as a teacher, for no one can do these signs that You do unless God is with him. Jesus answered and said to him, Truly, truly, I say to you, unless one is born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God. Nick Kadima said to him, How can a man be born when he is old, he cannot enter a second time into his mother's womb and be born. cannae. Jesus answered, Truly, truly I say to you, unless one is born of water, and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. That which is born of the flesh is flesh. And that which is born of the Spirit is spirit. Do not be amazed that I said to you, you must be born again.

Fredric Gray  04:13
The wind blows where it wishes. And you know the sound of it, but do not know where it comes from, and which way it's got where it's going. So is everyone who was born of the Spirit? The Kadima said to him, how can these things be? Jesus answered and said, said to him, Are You the teacher of Israel and do not understand these things? Truly, truly, I say to you, we speak of what we know and testify of what we have seen, and you do not accept our testimony. If I told you earthly things, and you do not believe, how will you believe If I tell you heavenly things, no one has ascended into heaven, but he who has descended from heaven, the Son of Man, as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so, must the Son of Man be lifted up. So that whoever believes will to him, have it all in Him have eternal life. For God so loved the world, that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have eternal life. For God did not send the Son into the world to judge the world, but that the world might be saved through him. I'll stop there. Why does Jesus are talking about being born again, this is remember the chapter divisions were not given by God, they were merely tools that people created to help access the information maybe a little quicker, more efficiently. In an era where historically people did not have access to the Bible, so they weren't memorizing this in every home, because the Bible had been hidden for a while. So maybe it was a tool they had created for that purpose. But if you look a little earlier, on Chapter Two, you realize, Jesus, this whole text is proving the divinity of Jesus Christ, and the fact that he's able to read the hearts of people and know what's in their hearts. And that's why he's saying what he's saying that he knows what's in his hearts. This guy is really wanting some important information, and Jesus is cutting right to the chase. So what does it mean to be born again? What does that mean? What's the process? That's what I want to talk about. He goes on and gives that great statement, we find that John 316, full of encouragement, full of judgment, and expectation of judgment, but also full of the hope of life that we can have, through believing in Jesus Christ. That's the whole point of the Gospel of John, and why it was written, according to chapter 21, verses 30 and 31. That we might believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that in believing we would have eternal life. So I asked you is that the end of the story? Really important observation to make about Scripture is that there are a number of different verses that talk about salvation. Sometimes they include the same information as other verses sometimes they are specifically individualistic in terms of that having one thing that may not be mentioned in another verse. Let me give you an example. We have John 316. Well, if you go to Romans chapter 10, verses nine and 10, it pretty much says that anyone who believes and confesses will be saved. And the question is, which verses right? God wants us to study to show ourselves approved. He gave us more than a few words in a sentence. He gave us writings through which we will understand how to be saved. And I want to encourage everybody here to recognize the Bible does not contradict itself, that we must embrace every passage that speaks to salvation. Because they're all right. Clearly, maybe not clearly. So I don't want to speak assumptive Lee and offend somebody? Well, I can say this. Clearly, Romans has more information. Romans 10 passage has more information about being saved, and John 316.

Fredric Gray  09:13
Which one is right? I heard somebody telling a story about reports they were giving to the police about an accident or something that happened but in involved the car and the car that went away. And different people were giving reports to the police. And some people said the car was blue. But another guy said the car one guy said the car was white. And they all were eyewitnesses. They said they were eyewitnesses. And people were starting to get frustrated until they find the car and they realize it's blue and white. That's just life. That's the way we communicate. And that's an as we have these words. I really want to encourage every Buddy, to take these verses I'm going to give you I'm going to go through a number of passages. Some I'm going to read some I'm going to reference some I'm going to quote, but this is recorded, you can probably get a recording of this before you leave today. Because the sound guys awesome. But I want you to really consider what we're going to read about being born again, because there's a number of different passages. And so, before we do, I want you to just understand, there's a few things he's saying here, if you look at C says, You must in verse three, you must be born again. To see the kingdom of God, John three, three. Then he says in verse five, you must be born of water, and the spirit to enter the kingdom of God. Then He says a few verses later, he refers to them as being born of the Spirit. I want to suggest this is an example of what I'm talking about. Being born of water in the spirit is the same as being born of the Spirit. And as the same as being born again. Okay? God is not a God of confusion. And this is how we talk. We have different words for all and we even have different words, New Testament for elders, different words used to describe preachers. This is not uncommon. We do the same thing in real life. So anyway, I think you get the point. But when I talk about being born of the Spirit, born again, it's all the same thing. Alright, so let me take you to a verse, we're gonna go to this John chapter one. If you remember John 316, you'll appreciate what we're going to read here, because it's consistent with John 316. Remember, John 316, in the past about being born again, it's the same conversation. It's a few breaths apart. So look at me in John chapter one. Verse 12, talking about Jesus, God tells us, but as many as received Him, to them, he gave the right, the King James says the power to become children of God, even to those who believe in his name, who were born, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God, that means they're born of God, they're born of the will of God. Okay, that's what it tells us. Let me just give you real quick, a passage that you can reference and read later, you may be familiar with it, the simplest statement in the Bible about salvation, in my opinion, the most concise, and all inclusive statement in the Bible as Ephesians 289 was tells us that we are saved by grace, which is from God, through faith, which is our part. And if not of ourselves does not have works, so nobody can boast. What that tells us is we're not working our way to heaven. We did, let's be clear on that off the bat off the tail on that right off the bat, we're not working our way to heaven. And every single thing God does to facilitate our salvation, whether you call it redemption, or mercy, or love, or renewable, or whatever it is, the blood of Christ. It's all it all can be encapsulated in this overarching umbrella of God's grace. In my opinion, I think God's grace includes all the things we read about that God does to facilitate our salvation. The word faith here, I believe, encapsulates all the things that God might say, we must do to be saved.

Fredric Gray  14:08
But then we but doesn't say we can't it's not a word. So we can't boast. Yes, that is consistent. And I want to show you we're going to talk about belief for a minute. What I want to show you is that everybody's got to do you got to do something to be saved. And just because you do have to do something to be saved, doesn't mean you're working your way to heaven. And yeah, amen. It is, there isn't a man worthy to be said to this because that's the way God works. He doesn't force us to be saved, even people. What you'll see what I'm saying, what let's take this passage here in John chapter one verses 12 and 13. What does it mean for me to be have the right to become a child of God? Does that mean that if I believe and receive Jesus and believe in him that I'm going to automatically become a child of God? No, because if I have a ticket to a Tennessee Titans football game, and I can go, that ticket gives me the right to become a spectator. That ticket gives me the power and the right to have my state changed from being an outsider to an insider, you follow me, if I use the ticket, I get to go inside the stadium, and watch the game because I have the right and the power to access that part of the stadium. And to be there, because I have a ticket. That's what I believe. Belief is, it gives us because God tells us it gives us the right to become a child of God. Now, here's an interesting thing. You look in John chapter six, verse 25, to 29. And you see an interesting statement that Jesus actually calls belief a work. Why would Jesus nothing else that God says, for us to do to be saved is called a work in the Bible, out of all the things the Bible talks about for us to be saved, in terms of our response in faith in believing the promises of God. Nothing else is called a work. Why is belief called a work? I think it's because belief is hard. In a world full of sin and betrayal, trusting somebody and putting your trust and faith in anybody can be hard. And believe me, when God says, He wants us to have faith in Him, He knows us. And he knows we're weak, and we're foolish. And we make mistakes, and we're fearful. That's why he calls us sheep. Animals who get distracted by anything, get scared, need constant reassurance, have no way to protect themselves. Belief can be hard. But now let me show you another verse that people may bring to you. Or you may know about. Keep your finger here, we'll come back here. But go back to go to First John chapter five. I want to reconcile this with something else that we read. His belief of work, Jesus called it a work. That's why the guy tells Jesus, I believe, help my unbelief. You think most people will recognize that we are not going to obey God perfectly. And we're not going to obey our way into heaven, through perfect obedience. But yet God still uses the word obey, tied to our salvation. So we're not going to obey any command perfectly, even the command to believe. So think about this in first John chapter five. Look at me in verse one. It says, Whoever believes that Jesus is the Christ is born of God. And whoever loves the Father loves the child born of him. Somebody might say, well, this says that belief does make you a child of God. And I want to say, this is where we combine the verses, and we never want to get into this game. I call my Bible verses better than your Bible verse. That's not healthy. We should celebrate an Amen, every single verse, every single one, even the ones who might not understand, we put our faith in God. So let me tell them suggest a way to look at this first, and I think is very consistent with the way being born again, and born of God as talked about in first John.

Fredric Gray  19:08
This is not saying when you believe you become a child of God. This is the recognition and the acknowledgement, that people who are born of God are believers. And I'll prove I want to prove it to you that is he is talking about the fruit or the reality of being a child of God and being born of God. Consistently. Go with me to First John Chapter 229 Chapter Two look at this, verse 29. If you know that he is righteous, you know that everyone also who practices right justness is born of him. He's showing us how to recognize people who have been born of God. That is an offshoot. That is something that you see in people who have already been born of God. Let's go chapter three, verse nine, no one who was born of God practices sin, because His seed abides in Him. And this is very important for our lesson today. The seed that we continually see identified, or talked about from the parable of the sower, from Luke eight, verse 11, even to now is the word of God. The Word of God is the seed. Okay? No one who was born of God practices sin, because His seed abides in him, and he cannot send because he is born of God. Again, he's not saying, by not sending you all of a sudden are born again. He's saying that's the that's the offshoot of being born again. Looking at chapter four verse seven, Beloved, let us love one another for love is from God, and everyone who loves is born of God and knows God. So if I love somebody, does that mean I'm all of a sudden born again? No, Jesus said, A new commandment I give to you. This is John 1334, and 35. He said, If he told him to love each other, and if you love each other people will know that you're my disciples, you're part of his people. See, when you become this people, then you love each other. Remember that, that loving each other part? As being what people who are born again, do, it's gonna become very important to our discussion, you with me? So then we go to chapter five, verse one, and you see the trend. I think we just hear so much in our world of belief, being associated with salvation, that it's hard to identify chapter five verse one, in that. Believing is something that people who are born again do, because we live in a checklist, Western thinking culture, that once I believe I've saved or once I believe I've got that checkmark down. That's not what belief is like. Let me give you another example. We talked about the why the book of John was written. In John chapter one, the disciples, people who become disciples are confessing Jesus as the Son of God, the Christ, the, the king of Israel, the one who was promised, they believed who he was right? They even confess them as the Son of God. So why a few pins jokes later, when all we read about after that is the wedding of Cana and Jesus, turning water to wine. And then in verse 11, it says they believed, they already expressed their belief, verbally to Jesus, they confessed who he was, they knew who he was, they believed at least who he was. And we see it again. They believe that happens repeatedly through the Gospel of John. That's another reason why we can't ever look at belief as a checklist. Belief is something that strengthens or weakens, I believe, help my unbelief. Why do people walk away from the Lord when they we know they believe the beginning? Because belief is a muscle and we exercise it, or we let it atrophy.

Fredric Gray  23:45
God bless you for your Bible classes, and focusing on God's word. So with me on that, so now it's one thing to have the verses here to help prove the point, lest the word belief in verse chapter five, verse one, get the best of you, and you think he's changing gears, he's talking about how to become a child of God or born again, looking first for, for whatever is born, who whatever is born of God overcomes the world. And this is the victory that has overcome the world, our faith. Are you going to say that? He's saying, once you overcome the world, then you're a child of God? No, no, no, you get the point. I think, now go to verse 18. We know that no one who was born of God sins, but He who was born of God keeps him and the Evil One does not touch him. That's a whole nother subject I'd love to talk about but you get the idea. He's talking about what happens when people have already been born again. Okay, let me let me mention something this idea of working what what is I'm going to reference to stories real quick. I don't have time to read them. But right before John 316 There was a passage I didn't I understand for a long time and to my Christianity. Let's go back to John three real quick. I want you to see what he says in verse 14. This is a discussion about being born again, you follow me? In verse 14 He says the first of all, he's talking about being born of the Spirit. And then he says, If you don't understand what I'm talking about earthly things, how are you going to understand what I'm talking about? heavenly things. And then he's still then he gives them an illustration to help them understand. God does it a lot. By the way. Jesus does that a lot. I mean, there's discussion. So verse 14, as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up, so that whoever believes will, will in Him have eternal life. So he is comparing whatever he's referencing with Moses, to the idea of believing in the son who must be lifted up. He's referencing Numbers, chapter 21, verses five through nine. I don't have time to turn there, but essentially, once once, so keep in mind, men 20, and older when they got out of Egypt, were over 600,000 Men, easily they had I mean, it's not a far cry that say there were at least 2 million people coming out of Egypt. 40 years later, we're almost 40 years later in the wilderness, through multiplication and what have you. They complain. And when he they complain to God, God sends the surface to bite people. And they're poisonous bites, so they die, peoples are dying. So think about millions of people having a death toll thing. And so God, they got that people tell God, Moses asked God to take away the serpents, right? That's what they prayed, for they wanted him to take away the serpents. Does God take away the serpents? No, he never takes away the serpents. sin has consequences. What does he do? He gives them a way to be saved from the consequences of their own sin. And what do they have to do? Moses creates this brass bronze serpent, and they have to go look at that serpent. Why did that make a big deal about the numbers of the people, because we're not talking about a crowd of 100 200 people like today, where you can put it here, everybody can look without ever doing anything. You're talking millions of people, millions of people, you better believe somebody is going to have to walk to the serpent to look at it. Right? What does that mean? If they're walking? Are they working their way to being saved from the serpent bite? No, because Jesus said, just like, what happened with the serpent is what has going to happen with the Son of Man, that those who believe will be saved, right? If you believe that you will be saved by that looking at that serpent,

Fredric Gray  28:11
then they'll go and look at it. You're not going to walk backwards. You're not going to fight. You don't want to look at it. You will go look at it if you believe. Are you going to have questions on the way? Maybe? Maybe not. But if you think that's your only way to be saying if you're gonna do whatever it takes, if you want salvation, that is not selfishness, that is availing yourself of what God wants you to have salvation. It's not selfishness. So you can even look at it as obeying God when turned to Jesus. So I want you to get that people had to do something, and it's called belief. They had to go to the serpent. I'm gonna tell your story. John, chapter nine. You go there, Jesus and his disciples come across a blind man who's born blind, right? They misinterpret reality, and they say, who sinned? That this guy was born blind. And Jesus says, No one's no one's sinned. Essentially, he says he's blind so you can see the glory of God. And what does Jesus do? Does this thing tells the guy, he tells the guy to go wash in the pool? Go wash himself, right? And then you can see the Jews asked him about it. And who did they get mad at for working on the Sabbath? Do they get mad at the guy because he got up and went and washed the stuff out of his eyes? No, but he was working right. He believe what Jesus said and he went and did it. but they didn't get mad at him for working on the Sabbath. They got mad at Jesus for working on the Sabbath, because they knew the power and the real work was coming from Jesus because Jesus was the one who healed them. You follow me? Well we do when the Savior tells us to do it to be saved, that's not work. That is a faithful, obedient response, believing what the Savior says. Amen. Just like with the brass serpent, and just like what the blind guy, and even the Jews who hated Jesus, even they knew that guy didn't do the real work, the real work was done by Jesus. So follow me here. A faithful obedient response to the words of the Savior. So follow me here, go with me.

Fredric Gray  31:02
to First Peter chapter one. I want you to put your finger there in first Peter one that I want to read to you. Out of Titus chapter three.

Fredric Gray  31:23
Titus chapter three, Reading First Peter one. So spent a lot of time talking about belief because it's the foundation of everything. Believing in the sun, gives us the right to become a child of God. Just like a ticket gives us the right to become a spectator and have our state changed. And we can be born of God's will. That's another way of by saying, we're not going to be born of the flesh or the will, as I saying, God is doing the work for us to be born. Just like in a physical birth, humans do the work in a physical adoption, humans do the work to adopt the baby. And now that that's human work, in the spiritual adoption, in the spiritual, new birth. God does the work. You follow me? So let me show you in Titus three, look at me in verse five. And talking about salvation. He says, He saved us not on the basis of deeds which we have done in righteousness, but according to his mercy, by the washing of regeneration and hear the renewal of the by the Holy Spirit, whom he poured out upon us richly through Jesus Christ, our Savior. Now watch this. so that being justified by his grace, by grace through faith, by His grace, we will be made heirs according to the hope of eternal life. The new birth means we are now a new person in the family of God and we are an heir we have an inheritance. That's why now we turn the First Peter chapter one. That's why in verse three, it tells us that we are born again to a living hope, of an inheritance. Now go with me down to verse 22. All this talk about God doing the work. Watch this. Since you have verse 22. The first one is talking to people who are already saved, since you have past tense in obedience to the truth. purified your souls for a sincere love of the brethren. fervently love one another from the heart. For you have been born again, not of seed which is perishable, but imperishable. That is through the living and enduring word of God. A lot here, guys. So here, he says, in obedience to the truth, the seed identified here as the living and enduring word of God, the Word of God is alive, it's living, it's active like he was for 12 says, it's it's not just words on a book, by reading these words if you are open, and like James 121 says, if, in humility, you receive the word that says, I can save you. This is God's power for salvation, the Gospel to all those who believe. That's Romans 116. So here it talks about the birth BORN AGAIN process by obedience to the truth. Let me give you a phrase used to describe the salvation that Jesus brings to his people. I'm not going to go there for sake of time, but in Ephesians five verse 26. He uses the phrase through the washing of water With the word. Thinking about all we've just read, I want you first to notice, this is the reason I reason I said, pay attention to that idea of loving each other being proof of being a disciple or being born again. So he says, you know, since you have purified yourself in obedience to the truth, he says that the purpose of that is to love each other, right. And the same thing is expressed in First John, chapter four, verse seven. But the thing I want you to notice even more, is that this phrase, washing of water with the word is no worthy. Especially in light of talking about being born of water, and spirit. These words are Holy Spirit inspired. And Ephesians, chapter six, verse 17, right after he says, right after he writes about the washing of water with the word, he indicates that the word of God he calls the sword of the Spirit.

Fredric Gray  36:14
Be clear. One of the ways God works in our lives, is by giving us these Holy Spirit inspired words, that when we believe them, and have are given the right, or the power to become a child of God, and be born of the will of God. If we obey these words, which are truth, that's not working our way to heaven. That's believing and doing what the Savior said. And anybody who wants to get mad about that needs to be let the people in John nine and get mad at Jesus, because he's doing all the work. So with that, go with me to Romans chapter six. Galatians 220 says, anybody who was upset well foster what Second Corinthians 517. And first says, anybody who was in Christ is a new creature. And Paul says in Galatians, chapter two, verse 20. That he's been crucified. It's now Christ who lives in Him. And the question is, at what point has he been crucified? This is why it's so important. What we're going to read right now, because we're going to read the point at which Christians are crucified with Christ, and are raised again to walk in a new life. That means being born again. It's very, very important. You want to know why so many people who say prayers for their salvation, do it multiple times in their life. I've done it multiple times. People hear me have done it multiple times. Because they don't really know it's hard to identify the point of salvation. We're about to read about baptism, which by the way is water. John, the bath is a baptizing and water. You read the end of John three, the beginning of John for you realize people Bapt were baptizing because there's lots of water. They were immersing people. So when the first sermon and x two, they're asked, Peters asked what the woman said, once they become believers and realize they just killed the Messiah they've been waiting for. And they say, what do we do? What shall we do? You know what Peter does not say, You can't do anything. If God who does all the words, God, you can't do anything to be saved. He doesn't say that. He tells these newfound believers to repent and be baptized for the parents of their sins, and they will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. And let me let me tell you what they would not think. They would not think this is some weird spiritual baptism. They would they would. They've been talking for three and a half years about all the baptisms occurring. So when someone a few weeks later after the birth, death of Christ says it talks about being baptized or immersed. They're gonna know exactly what they're talking about. That's what everybody's been doing for several years, but now we're doing in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. So, or as Matthew 28, verse 18, and following what say, the name of the Father, Son of the Holy Spirit. So in Romans chapter six, verse three, it says, or do you not know talking to people who are saved already, that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus have been baptized into his death therefore We have been buried with Him through baptism into death. so that as Christ was raised from but from the dead through the glory of the Father, so we too, might walk in newness of life. Guys, this is it. This is not working your way to heaven. This is putting your faith in God. And here's what God's doing. He's giving us something physical and tangible, something visible. To identify what is invisible and what's happening, that you can't touch. And you can't see. That's why Matthew nine, when Jesus has a guy who's crippled, he can't walk brought to him and I put them through the roof because the crowd so big. And Jesus tells him Your sins are forgiven. Listen, you don't have to be a rocket scientist to see that a lot of these faith healers, all these faith healers are healing a lot of invisible ailments, internal things. They don't do what is in John nine. And they don't go take some famous blind person like Stevie Wonder and give him site.

Fredric Gray  41:12
It's always internal stuff that's hard to prove. And so Jesus says something that's hard to prove. Your sins are forgiven. And they're like, oh, who can forgive sins? But God, he said, which is easier or harder to say? Is it easier to say Your sins are forgiven, or pick up a pallet and walk? Well, obviously, it's easier to say Your sins are forgiven, because nobody can prove that. But if you take a guy that can't walk, everyone knows he can't so much. So they make a hole in the roof and put them down. He says, just so you know, the Son of Man has power to forgive sins, pick up a pallet and walk and he picked it up and walked. God often does something that we can identify. So that we can have faith in what is invisible. That's what happened with the guy who was told to pick up his palette and walk. And that's what we have in water baptism, a specific point where we know for sure, because we are told we are dying with Christ. And we are raising rising the walk in a new life. That means being born again, of water and the Spirit and bio bent obeying these Holy Spirit inspired words. You follow me? That is being born again. And we get to escape judgment. Because it's God's will that we are born that way. It's his work. I hope it makes sense. You can get a recording if I went too fast and threw too many verses out there. But it was anybody here who wants to be born again. Please come forward while we stand and sing
