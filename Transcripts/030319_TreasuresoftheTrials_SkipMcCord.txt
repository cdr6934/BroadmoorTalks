Unknown Speaker  00:01
Good evening. I start things off tonight with a story. Once there was a blacksmith who gave his heart to God,

Unknown Speaker  00:15
though conscientious in his living, still he was not prospering materially. In fact, it seems that from time to time of his conversion, more trouble, affliction and loss are sustained than ever before. Everything seemed to be going wrong. One day, a friend who was not a Christian, stopped by his garage to talk to him, sympathizing with him and some of his trials. The friend said, It seems strange to me that so much affliction surpass over you just just at the time that you become an earnest Christian, an earnest Christian. Of course, I don't want to weaken your faith or anything like that. But here you are, with God's help and guidance. And yet everything is seems to be steadily worse. I can't help but wonder why that is. The blacksmith didn't answer immediately, it was evident that he had thought the same question before. But finally, he said, you see here, this raw iron, which I have to make in the horses use,

Unknown Speaker  01:26
you know what I do with it, I take a piece and I heat it in the fire until it's red, and even till it's almost white. And I take my hammer and beat it, and I beat it,

Unknown Speaker  01:39
I try to shape it into what I want it to be. Now plunge it into a pellet cold water to temperate. Then I heat it again, that I hammered some more a punch it again. I do this until it's finished. I do it until it takes the shape I want to have. But sometimes I find a piece of iron that won't stand up to this treatment, the heat and the hammering, and the cold water just too much for it. I don't know why it fails in the process. But I know it will never make a good horse issue. He pointed to a heap of scrap in the corner that was near the door of his shop. When I get a piece I can't shake. Like I want it. I thought it was crappy. It will never be good for anything. He then went on, I know that God has been holding me in the fires of affliction. Now Phil does hammer upon me. But I don't mind. Because my prayer is, I don't mind if only he can bring me to what he wants me to be what I should be. So in all these hard things, my prayer is simply this. Try me in any way you wish, Lord. But just don't throw me in the scrap heap. So we see here from the story that we faced when we face trials and myths, or we must understand that God's will is taking place and that we must be willing to be shaped and formed into something better. Or we will find ourselves in that scrap heap. We don't want to be there. So my Listen, my lesson tonight will be centered around the treasures of the trial. Its treasures that we can and should receive through trial. So we're gonna challenge you with one question tonight starting off when you face trials, struggles or difficulties, does it make you better or bitter. So think about that as we go through this. So just before I get started, I want to thank the elders for let me do this. It's honored to be up here. I think it's so cool that they let the men do this. It's a challenge. I get nervous and anxious for it with a good nervous and I really like it because it helps me grow as a leader helps me grow as a teacher helps me grow as a Christian. And it makes me deep dive into topics that maybe I wouldn't have before. And typically when I get the chance to do this, I want to pick a topic. I guess selfishly to pick a topic that I'm struggling with. Because then I'll be I know it'd be passionate about it and I know I want to learn more about it and then try to teach you something that maybe can you could have that can help you with. So confession time for me. When I experienced trial or struggles or difficulties. I tend to get angry. I tend to get frustrated. I get impatient. I get difficult. I get stubborn I bet you do too. It makes me realize that I must reframe the way I think about trauma and struggles. That is not exactly a curse. But it's an opportunity for growth, and maturity. So if we think of it that way, maybe it's gonna be easier to get through. We all go through rough situations, whether it's large or small. So we have, we all have daily struggles, right? So we hit traffic that makes us late for work. The check engine light on the dash is on again, you just got another speeding ticket. The kitchen sink is stopped up again. The thermal coupling on the water heater goes out and you have to take cold showers for three days. And by the way, if these examples settled a specific a might be because that's what I went through the past year, could be maybe you can't sleep in on Saturday, because you got too much going on. And you don't get enough sleep, all the parents can attest to that, right? You need that the laundry is always piled up. The dishes are always piled up, feels like the house is always messy and destroyed. There's just not enough hours in the day, right? And you never get to do what you want to do. You do remember the days you were a kid, and you got to do whatever you want to do with no responsibility. So kids,

Unknown Speaker  06:35
be patient. You don't have to grow up that fast. Then, of course, you have more serious struggles, right?

Unknown Speaker  06:43
You have major drama, eye problems with family members. You have a parent that just passed away. He just found out you have cancer. You have to have a surgery that will disable you for a while and put strain on your family.

Unknown Speaker  07:01
You just lost your job. He just found out that your spouse has been unfaithful.

Unknown Speaker  07:08
You're struggling with a pet sin that you can't seem to get control of. You can't stop being depressed or anxious. Whatever the situation. Trials are real, and they're hard. And they can either make us or break us. Our lives are largely defined by the decisions we make and the decision is yours. When things get tough, when your backs against the wall, will you be better or bitter. So we're gonna deep dive in that a little bit dry just for a few minutes. So we've all heard the phrase, when life hands you lemons make lemonade, right? It's so easy to say it's so pleasant to hear the sounds so good. But man, it's easier said than done right? But this but this basic, basic philosophy is sound, and it's biblical. Throughout the Bible, we see people who have turned defeat into victory. It turned trials with a triumph, or with God's help. Instead of being the victims, they became victors. The first chapter of James gives us hope that we too can have the same experience today. Whether we do whether we're dealing with trolls on the outside, or temptations on the inside, their faith in God and Jesus we can be better. And successfully we can win the fight against Satan, who tries to make us bitter, because he wants us bitter because that's when he can do the most damage. So if you have your Bibles, your attorney James Warren that's going to that's what we spend most of our time tonight. James chapter one to theory. counted all joy my brothers when you meet trials of various kinds, for you know that the testing of your faith produces patience, and let patience have its full effect, that you may be perfect and complete, lacking in nothing. If any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask God who gives generously to all without reproach, and it will be given to him. But let him ask him faith, with no doubting. For the one who doubts is like a wave of the sea that is driven and tossed by the wind for that person must not suppose that he received anything from the Lord is double is a double minded man unstable in all those ways. So we're going to focus on some key words in that text to help us turn trash into treasure.

Unknown Speaker  09:58
So if you're looking at verse Do my first keyword will be Count. Count it all joy when you fall into various troubles. So that keyword in that versus when right? Not when we have, it's not going to be if we have Charles it's going to be when. So as Christians, we must expect this it we're going to have troubles, we're going to have struggles, we're going to have difficult times you can count on it's going to happen. And John 1633 Jesus said, I told you these things so that in time you may have peace. In this world you hit you will have trouble. But take heart I have overcome the world. And acts 1422 Paul said we must go through many hardships to enter the kingdom of God. It's Satan's goal to throw everything at us and make us experienced trials. First Peter five eight, your enemy the devil prowls around like a roaring lion looking for someone to devour. So what's the be our response to this verse to you see, Kevin at all joy. This is what attitudes of the apostles I mean, that's hard to do right have joy when you fall in the various trials. But x 541, the apostles, the apostles left the Sanhedrin rejoicing because they had been counted worthy of suffering, disgrace for the name of Jesus. And Paul, in Romans five, three, we must rejoice in our sufferings, because we know that suffering produces perseverance. So we see that the first step is to thank God and adopt a joyful attitude. And that's not easy, right? So how do we rejoice during trials? It's much easier said than done, much like the turning the lemons into lemonade. So that leads us to our second key word in verse three, know knowing that the testing of your faith produces patience. Knowing is the right knowledge concerning the value of trials. And that makes it possible for us to have a joyful attitude. We need to understand since we don't understand that trials are going to test their faith. Faith tested can bring out the best in us if we let it just as fire purifies gold. Just as intense heat and pressure produce diamonds. Just as training makes athletes stronger. With this understanding, we can have joy and trials because we know that testing is going to work for us. Not against this even though that's hard to imagine sometimes. Let's see in Second Corinthians 417, for our light and momentary troubles are achieving for us and eternal glory that far outweighs them all. So bringing a positive attitude towards trial helps us to mature. So going back to one three, knowing that the testing of your faith produces patience, so fit faith tested produces patients and Romans five, Romans 533 through four we see that it says not only so but we also rejoice in our sufferings because we know that suffering produces perseverance. Perseverance produces character, and character produces hope. Patience is not simply a passive acceptance of circumstances though. You look at the Greek word for patience. It's who bump poop on hoop Amane hope I'm saying that right. So if you break that down the hoopoe, it means under the Monet menders to remain in and to abide. So this kind of helps us describe that the ability to be steadfast, and stand tall and stand tall in the face of difficulty. Patience is a courageous perseverance in the face of suffer suffering. It is the wheel to keep pushing through even when it's tough. Such a quality of steadfastness can only be achieved through experiencing those trials is that as the saying goes a smooth see never produced the skillful, skillful sailor are gonna have to have trials to get better, right. Having an understanding of the value of trials and what they can accomplish, helps us produce a joyful attitude when we go through those trials. That leads us to our third keyword in verse four. And that's let let patients have it's perfect work.

Unknown Speaker  14:48
They truly turn these trials into triumph. We must be willing to let patients do the work. Naturally, we always want to get through the trials and difficulties as soon as we can. Right We don't want to last long, we want to just get it fixed, get over with whatever it may be. But sometimes, maybe it's best that you simply embrace the struggle patiently and see what that does for you. Often, we tend to grumble within the complain. Instead of patiently accepting the trial, and doing good despite it. Another thing that I see through that is selfishness really, because often times will ruminate, when we're in a trial, we want to look at how we're feeling, or what's wrong with us, or what needs to happen to make us feel better about it. Sometimes it's best to serve others. I think about I think back a couple months ago, a month or so ago, or Trevor gave an invitation, they talked about Second Thessalonians 313. Do not grow weary of doing good. The simple act of doing good for others, can help change your attitude and can change your mood. So going back to the fourth verse there, for when will the patient's habits perfect work for when patients has had his opportunity to do work, it produces maturity, and one for the Word Perfect. Doesn't Egypt suggest being flawless or without sin because we can't do that, right? We're not We're not perfect, we're not going to be. But maybe it suggests that it's a completeness or wholeness or maturity that we need to, to strive towards. Maturity can only form when we when experiences gained. And when patients have had it's time to work within you. Much like a runner who's training for a full marathon. He must be patient and in his training, willing to put forth the effort, mile after mile to get better. The saying goes, practice makes perfect. But practice isn't always easy or fun. It's work and it takes effort. If we wish to run the race effectively, spiritually, spiritually speaking, then we must develop this patience, trials and difficulties that test our faith can also help develop our spiritual character. It forces us to form humility. And it means that we can't run the race alone we have to do with God we have we have to have God. This humility brings us to the final key word. And that's ask. So in the, in the fifth verse, let him ask of God. If any of you lacks wisdom, he should ask God who gives generously. Were going to have to have wisdom to endure the struggles. Which means that God has promised that he will give it generously if we ask, which means that prayer is a vital part of any kind of struggle we go through. It means that we have to include God and everything we do. Wisdom, though, is not knowledge, per se. And it's important to distinguish between wisdom and knowledge, right? Knowledge involves information and facts. Wisdom is ability or insight to use those facts in the best way. So another major aspect of our endurance of trial is to study and gain the knowledge and pray to God for the wisdom to apply that knowledge

Unknown Speaker  18:29
to help us. So this is gonna be our invitation song. But anyways, this is the most important part about my lesson tonight.

Unknown Speaker  18:49
This was this song was inspiration for this lesson. This is my favorite song that we sang. I remember the night first night we sang it, I was sitting right over there. And I wrote about wrote down in tears when I heard the words. It's very, very beautiful, very impactful. So what I want to do is go over one of the verses, a favorite verse, and just speak to that just a little bit. So what I want to show you is verse, verse three, let the treasures of the trial form

Unknown Speaker  19:21
within me as I go. There you see there one of our keywords in there, let

Unknown Speaker  19:28
and also the keyword form, right. Just like the blacksmith forming the iron, with the metal in the fire, we have to go through the struggles so that we form those treasures. And these treasures are for God right? They're not for us. They're used to please God. It's a beautiful verse. Then we're gonna go to the next of that and at the end of this long passage, let me leave them at your throne. That's such a good day. imagery right there. I mean, just imagine the picture that right. And so what I want to do is I want to set up this imagery for you. So imagine if you had these treasures with the trial if they if they were able to be physical in nature. So all the trials, your struggles, your difficulties, your heartaches, everything you go through, if you could physically bottle it up somehow. And these treasures represent lessons learned. wisdom gained, character built, selfishness suffocated to serve others. Patients made better. Integrity made stronger. Imagine placing all these things into a box. How big would your box be? And imagine walking up to Jesus and His throne and leaving his throne. As in Lord, this is what I did. Not not not from a standpoint of boastfulness. But imagine if you had that box? Would you barely be able to hold it? Would it be so heavy that you could barely get into that throne? These things are reflection of your heart, what your heart look like. Just like the parable of the talents, and Matthew 25, the master gave one of them five talents. And he produced five more. So you have that box, you lay it at Jesus's throne. I'm sure that looking back at the, in the parable of the talents that the man that produced five more, that wasn't easy for him, right? I mean, he had to go through, struggles to get that it wasn't easy. It took work, it took effort, but he doubled it for his master. So he took what he had, and he made it better for God. So just imagine if you played if you had that box and you place it his throne, you look at him. Wonder what he's gonna say. And just like in the parable of talents, well done good and faithful servant. You've been faithful with a few things. So I'll put you in charge of many things. Come and share your from your masters happiness. Or on the other side, what if your box is small, whatever is so small that you can barely if you can just hold it one hand. That's all you have to offer. It's all you did. Your show was all the struggles the USA, that's all it did for you. It's all that you let it work work within you. And you were just you're ashamed to place that box at his feet because you knew he could have done better. And I'm imagine what he would say to you. Thinking back to the parable of talents again in Matthew 25. The man was one talent. He didn't produce any more he just had that one talent at the end. And the master said, You wicked and lazy servant. And then he was thrown outside into the darkness where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. So brothers and sisters asked you tonight how big is your box? If it's not that big now maybe you need to work on getting a bigger and I'll ask you one more time as we about to close the your trials, your struggles, your difficulties that make you better or better. This time on offer invitation. For those that you're for any of those out there tonight that want to become a Christian. That's great. We have the means to do that for you tonight. Or if you just want the prayers from the congregation and we can also do that too. But either way, come forward as we stand in sting
