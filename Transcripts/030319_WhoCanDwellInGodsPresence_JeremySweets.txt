Morning, I certainly have a good crowd here today. We're packed in here, as is often the case, but it's good to see everyone here. It's good that we can gather together and worship our God. We have many visitors here. And we want you to know that you're our honored guest. We meet on a regular basis in order to give glory and praise to God. And that's our goal here at Broadmoor, not only here, when we gather together, but also in our lives as we leave here. So it's good to have all of you here and appreciate your, your attendance, one special guest, I'll make mention of as my mom, so I'm glad to have her here with us today as well. I'd like to begin with a question. And it's a question that scripture poses. And that is, who can dwell in the presence of God? Who can dwell in the presence of God? That's an important question. It's one that we could sit and think about for a while, in fact, Mike Roy led our class this last quarter talking about and thinking about dwelling in God's presence. In Psalm 15. This question is asked, Who can dwell in God's presence? It's an important question. Who can do that? You know, I think the way that it's worded is also important. We live in a time that is really quite spiritual. People have moved past, thinking that science provides all the answers. And so many people are seeking to be spiritually minded in some way today, and I'm talking about a culture in a broader context. But often they see the universe as having some kind of force, they may use that kind of language, or they may talk about being in touch with their spirituality, and often what is described or what is considered as the technique about how to do that, or how to be in touch in this way. But that's not the question that's asked here. What can I do to be in touch with some kind of divine presence? No, this makes it very personal and ask the question who can dwell in God's presence? It's not just a divine force. But here, it's God's presence. And the question is not what technique is necessary, but rather who can dwell in God's presence. So go ahead and open your Bibles to Psalm 15, if you've not already done so. And notice the first verse, Oh, Lord, Who shall sojourn in your tent? Who shall dwell on Your holy hill? Here? The idea is this question is, first of all posed to God, oh, Lord, Who shall just sojourn in your tents. Now the imagery that's used here is one of a traveler, and you might see a traveler as they're going along way they will come upon a resident that would have a tent there. And you might think of like Abraham, when he entertained the travelers that came by and he provided them food. And so the question here is, Who shall sojourn in your tent, or come and be invited as a guest or a traveller into your tent? Who can experience that kind of intimacy that is involved there.

Jeremy Sweets  03:27
This may also have reference not just to any tent, but to the tabernacle. For we know that there the presence of God was, and the Israelites would come before that, we get a sense of that, as we continue on when he says, Who shall dwell in Your holy hill, the holy hill being Zion, or Jerusalem. And that's the place of the temple, who shall dwell in Your holy hill or on your temple? Who can come before your presence? And that is the question that is posed. Who can do that? Now this psalm very well may have been used in worship, as the people prepare to go into the temple and approach God in His presence. And the question who was asked, Who can dwell in God's presence? Notice the question is addressed to God, for God alone really can provide the answer. Since he is the final judge, and arbiter of this question. We come before God. Now as I asked this question, I'll provide a few comments and that is, first of all, none of us can hide from God in one sense. None of us ever escape the presence of God. You will remember Jonah that tried to flee from the presence of God but was the god failed to know where Jonah was? That Jonah truly hide from God that was his attempt. But it couldn't be done. And so in that sense, God is all knowing, all seeing he sees and knows, but this has reference to a type of relationship of fellowship that exists. And so who can come and God's presence and enjoy his fellowship with Him? You'll notice that the psalmist provides an answer to that question. And he does that in verses two through five. So let's look at those verses now. Who can dwell in God's presence? Well, first of all, he says it's a person of integrity, a person of integrity. Verse two says, He who walks blamelessly and does what is right, and speaks truth in his hearts. Here, blameless or to walk blameless is to live a life that is above reproach, to live a life so that others would not have reason to doubt your character. This word blameless is also translated as as simply integrity, integrity. And this word when is used a say a sacrifice means something that is complete, unscathed or intact. And so when we apply that same concept to a person, someone that lives in integrity, they live in such a way that they are complete and intact. They're not two faced. They don't have one act or way of living by themselves, or out of worship, but they are complete and intact integrity. They live in a blameless way, all of the time. Who can come before God? Well, the tech says it is a blameless one. It goes on to say that this is one who does what is right, there is a standard of right and wrong and this person does what is right. And it's recognized by all around him. The text says not only that, but he speaks truth in his heart, some translation sight from his heart. And so the idea is that truth comes out of his mouth, and why does it come out of his mouth? Because it's in his heart. He's a man of integrity. He speaks what is right, because he stores up what is right in his hearts. So who can come before God, the Psalmist says, the one that can come before God is one that is blameless or a person of integrity. Now, he's also going to say that this is someone who is not something or does not do something. And in verse two, or excuse me, verse three says it's not one who harms. It's a person of integrity, not one who harms others. Notice verse three, it says, who does not slander with his tongue and does no evil to his neighbor, nor takes up a reproach against his friend, it does not use his mouth or his tongue in order to harm other people in order to to tear them down.

Jeremy Sweets  08:05
I'm probably not telling you anything new to say that that happens all the time. That your tongue can be used to cut others to hurt others. And many people do that in an effort to bolster themselves at least that's what they think, is happening. But this man of integrity that can come before God and His presence does not slander does not speak evil of his neighbor, and it also does not do evil to his neighbor. He is one that does what is right. And when he turns that to other people, he continues to do what is right. It does not slander, he does no evil and he takes up he does not take up a reproach against his friend. He does not consider those things, an accusation, maybe a false accusation that would be made, he does not take that up upon him. He is one that does no harm to others. So who is this one that can dwell in God's presence? Verse four, goes on to describe this person is a principled person. It says in whose eyes a vile person is despised, but who honors those who fear the Lord. Notice that this person has his priorities in the right place. He values what should be valued. Those that do evil, he does not hold them up as someone that is great and grand, but rather one that does what is right. He looks down upon that which is evil. In Isaiah, chapter five, verse 20, you see that some people had gotten that turned upside down. And that's so happened. That's so easy to happen today. There it says Woe to those who call evil good and good evil. Do you think that happens today? When people become what is right in their own eyes when they are the standard of right and wrong? When people pursue pleasures, and what feels good to them, then we get things mixed up, don't we, we get things turned upside down. There are so many people today that call evil good and good evil.

Jeremy Sweets  10:27
But here, the Psalmist says, the one that can approach God in His presence is one that has those values in the right place. They consider what is evil, and they call it evil, and they despise that they hate evil. And they honor those who fear the Lord. They are principled. We go on to see at the end of verse four, it says that he swears to his own hurt and does not change. Notice that this individual is not a person of convenience. You know, some people do what's right, when it's easy. Some people do what's right when it's convenient. But when it becomes difficult, then they begin to change or they begin to to fudge, what is what they're going to do. But here, the text says this person swears to his own hurt. What does that mean? That means when someone makes a promise, or commits themselves, even if it is something that would hurt them, they do not change, because they honor their word, they honor their oath, even if it is difficult, even if it is harmful to themselves, because they have placed the principle of doing what is right above their ease above their convenience above what is comfortable. Who can dwell in the presence of God, it is a principle person, one who does what is right, no matter the cost, no matter the cost, it is a person of principle. And again, he provides someone that it is not it's not an opportunist, not an opportunist, you probably know what an opportunist is, if you've heard any kind of PSAs public service announcements around Christmas, they will say something like, make sure and lock your your car and make sure that you remove all your valuables out of plain sight. Why is that? Because some people if they see an opportunity to take advantage of someone else, they take it. And so if somebody's walking by and your car's unlocked, they might not have been planning to do it. But there's an opportunity and they're gonna take it in Psalm 15 And verse five. Here it says this is one who does not put out his money at interest, and does not take a bribe against the in the innocent. This is one that is not seeking to make money on the backs of others, one that is not seeking to testify against the innocent simply for their game. They have not prioritized themselves, making money and making their own comfort above others. This is not an opportunist. And by that I mean one that would take advantage of others given the opportunity. But rather, this is a principled person, one who does what is right, and he does what is right within his own heart, and also is that extends to other people. Now notice the conclusion of the psalm in verse five. He who does these things shall never be moved. This is also translated as never be shaken. The net Bibles that uses the language of shall not be up and so do you see what the psalmist is trying to say? This type of person is one that has a stability within themselves. The godly person can stand on God who is described as the rock or called the rock. The godly person has a stability. Elsewhere in the Psalms, it uses the language that his foot will not slip. He will not fall, he will not stumble. That's important to know because often we look at the wicked and we think that they have what is important. Oh often were envious of the wicked because they get ahead at the expense of others. They take advantage of others. Why did the wicked prosper the Psalms will often even ask that question. But here's what is important to note is they may appear to prosper but they have no true stability in themselves. They will be shaken if not in this life. In the next, but the righteous and the godly one may never have wealth may never have popularity or tremendous social standing, but they have a stability. They will not be moody,

Jeremy Sweets  15:20
who shall dwell in the presence of God? Here are the psalmist answers, a godly individual, a godly individual. So as we've looked at this Psalm, I want to continue on to think about God's presence as we look throughout Scripture. Again, this is a common theme. And as I looked at this passage, it really made me reflect on much of the rest of Scripture. What does it mean to dwell in the presence of God? And who can do that? Well, I think God has always wanted to dwell with His people. And that's a theme that runs throughout Scripture. So who can dwell in God's presence? Well, you'll notice first of all, that God did dwell with His people in the Garden of Eden. There the text says that God created man in His own image, and he formed the man from the dust of the ground and he breathed into his nostrils the breath of life. God gave him life, Genesis two in verse seven. In Genesis two in verse eight, it says that he planted a garden, and he placed the man there, we also see that he would go on to form or fashion the woman from a rib of the man. And the man and the woman that says were naked, and they were not ashamed. They enjoyed fellowship with each other, but they also enjoyed fellowship with God. They dwelled in his presence, God walked among them, and they enjoyed that presence. But there was something that upset the current. I believe that God really wanted to live forever with Adam and Eve. His goal here his intention was an eternal fellowship, a dwelling together in each other's presence, but you'll notice that sin, upset God's desire. And so sin interrupted this presence. In Genesis chapter three, in verse eight, you will notice after Adam and Eve sinned, that it says that they hid themselves from the presence of the Lord God, as God was walking, they went and hid themselves. They separated themselves from God's presence. It says in Genesis chapter three and verse eight, so yes, God dwelled with them, they experienced the presence of God, but sin interrupted God's intentions there. We see elsewhere in Scripture, for example, in Isaiah chapter 59, that sin, destroys or breaks this fellowship, removes the presence of God. And when that happens, it is not God that commits the sin and it is not God that is liable her guilty of the separation. In Isaiah 59, it says, Behold, the Lord's hand does not shorten that it cannot save or his ear doll that it cannot hear. But your iniquities have made a separation between you and your God and your sins have hidden His face from you so that he does not hear. Notice what happens here. It says that sin creates a separation between God and man. And did you notice that it uses the exact same language as that of the garden? There it says that, that your sins have hidden His face from you. hidden His face from you so that he does not hear we remove ourselves from God. There is a hiding that takes place when we sing. In Psalm 51, I believe that David recognize this as he repented. He thought about God's presence. And in Psalm 51, in verse 10, he says, this, create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a right spirit within me. Cast me not away from your presence, and take not your Holy Spirit from me. Restore to me the joy of your salvation and uphold me with a willing spirit. And so as we begin to even think about and dwell what is the presence of God, I think that David touches on it here, created me a clean heart renewing we a right spirit, Cast me not away from your presence, but Restore to me the joy of your salvation, and uphold me with a willing spirit to dwell in the presence of God is to enjoy fellowship with Him. And we can use other words to describe that, to have salvation from our sins, to have a willing spirit and dwell with a willing spirit with God. And David recognize that, as he contemplated his own sin,

Jeremy Sweets  20:17
he begged God, do not cast your presence away from me, because he knew what sin can do. Yes, sin interrupted the process. We see that later that God came along and desire to have a covenant with His people. God chose one man Abraham and his family, from whom would come a great and mighty nation. And this mighty nation would create an avenue for restored fellowship. Ultimately, one man again would come from this nation. But as God shows Abraham and his family and the nation that would come from them, we see as the book of Exodus begins, that that nation was enslaved. And God announced his attentions, his intentions as he sought to bring them out of Egypt. And he says, I will take you into Exodus six and verse seven, I will take you to be my people, and I will be your God. And you shall know that I am the Lord your God, who brought you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians. Notice what God is offering to them. He says, I will be your God, and you will be my people. God says, I'm going to dwell with you. In Exodus 25, and verse eight, we see the representation of that dwelling presence was the tabernacle. God said, and let them make a sanctuary that I may dwell in their minutes, make a tabernacle, a sanctuary, that I may dwell in their midst, it was a portable sanctuary, so that God could go with them, in fact, as Moses, face the, the consequences of the sins of Israel, in Exodus 33, when they had practiced idolatry, and God says that he was ready to wipe them out, Moses reminds God, he says, But you have said, My presence will go with you, and I will give you rest. He reminds god of his covenant, his promise. And then we see in Exodus 14, verse 34, that the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle. You see, God desired to dwell with His people. But that presence was a mediated presence was not direct access like they had in the garden. For with this tabernacle came a process of priests, and sacrifices, in which people would come and make sacrifice. And why would they do that? They did that because of the sin problem. They made sacrifices so that people might be able to approach God and dwell and live in His presence. We see that this continues on to the temple. The tabernacle was a portable structure. And you remember that God promised them the land of Canaan, and so they traveled to the land of Canaan. When they get to the land of Canaan, they make that portable structure more permanent with the temple. in First Kings eight, verses 10 through 13, the exact same language of Exodus 40, is used there, the glory of the Lord filled the temple, so that the priests could not enter their they could not come straight into the presence of God, God would dwell among them, but again, it would be a mediated dwelling in which the priests would come and worship with them. Now this is important as we stop and reflect here because you'll remember our Psalm And Psalm 15. Who shall sojourn in your tent? Oh, Lord, Who shall dwell on Your holy hill? So the Solomos asked, during this period of Israelite history who can come before God, I think that specifically has referenced to worship but it's something to reflect on and think on. Can any just anybody come before God the Israelites knew no, not just anybody. So who can even come in worship before God?

Jeremy Sweets  24:34
Someone that lives how they want and denies God in their life? No. A godly individual a man of integrity, one who does what is right and seeks after God. But even within that, I believe that there is this background that says that that is even a mediated dwelling. It requires a mediator or one that would bridge the gap. As we move on to the prophets, they look forward to a new covenant. In Jeremiah 31. There we see a promise of this new covenant. And there again, it says that I will be their God and they shall be my people, but there will be something different about this new covenant. For it says, They shall not be taught to know the Lord, but they shall know the Lord. And he also says in verse 34, that I will forgive their iniquity, and I will remember their sin no more, this New Covenant would be different. sins can be forgiven, sins could be wiped away, and God would again dwell with His people that was fulfilled in Jesus Christ as He brought the New Covenant. In Matthew one and verse 23, as Jesus birth was announced, or promise, it says, And you shall call him a manual, which means God with us, God would dwell with His people in the person of Jesus Christ. In John one in verse 14, it says that this word, is an eternal word that was at the beginning of creation, and it is that word Jesus Christ, that would take on flesh and dwell among us, Jesus dwelled among us. And he did this in order that he might save us from sin and fulfill the anticipation of the New Covenant from Jeremiah 31. So that he would take away our sin. Hebrews nine mentions this work of atonement, and it says, Therefore Christ has entered into heaven, itself, now to appear in the presence of God on our behalf. Can just anyone brazenly approach God in His presence was we see the story unfold? That's not how it's worked. But Jesus Christ here it says, He went into heaven, the true tabernacle, the true temple, the True Holy place, in order to appear before the presence of God on our behalf. Who can dwell in the presence of God? Well, we see the early church, those that believe that Jesus was the Christ, they were baptized into Christ, they were raised to walk in newness of life. The early church is not a building, but it was a collection of people that accepted the gospel message. And there we see of the early church and various passages, one being First Corinthians three verses 16 and 17. It talks about the dwelling of God with his people. Do you not know that you're a God's temple and God's Spirit dwells in you, If anyone destroys God's temple, God will destroy him for God's temple as holy and you are that temple. It's important to note here the you are plural. He's talking here to the Corinthian church. And he says there to the church, that you are God's temple. You are God's temple. God's temple is holy, and you are that temple. God wants to dwell with us. And the question remains who can dwell with God? In Ephesians, two in verse 22, as he reflects upon the Jews and the Gentiles, there, he says, it's no longer just the Jews that can be saved, but the Gentiles have also been brought near by the blood of Christ. And as you reflect upon the fact that both groups can have access to the Father through Jesus Christ, He says in Ephesians, two and verse 22, in him, you also are being built together into a dwelling place for God by the spirits. Who can dwell in the presence of God? Well, the church enjoyed access to the Father, through the Spirit, because of the work of Jesus.

Jeremy Sweets  29:18
And the Bible also not only tells us about what has happened, but it tells us about what will happen. God desires that we would dwell with Him again. And everything we've seen here with the tabernacle, the temple, and even with the church has been a mediated dwelling. It is required an intercessor one that would come on our behalf. But I believe one day we will have an unmediated well dwelling in the presence of God just like an Eden, and that will be in heaven. Revelation depicts a future time when all All Things will have been made right? Satan in the reign of sin will have been defeated and God will reign supreme. He reigned supreme in one sense now, but he's not universally recognized. But in that day, he will reign supreme and be universally recognized. There'll be no doubters. There will be no doubters. John's revelation provides a glimpse into heaven. In Revelation 21, in verse three, it says, And I heard a loud voice from the throne saying, Behold, the dwelling place of God is with man. He will dwell with them, and they will be his people, and God himself will be with them as their God. Let those words sink in. The voice announces from the throne and says, the dwelling place of God is with man. It's hard to fathom. When we talked about who can dwell in the presence of God? Well, the reason why that's hard for us to fathom is because we consider God's holiness and our loneliness. And it doesn't seem like those two things go together. God's Granger and our sinfulness can we? Can anyone possibly dwell in God's presence? Well, if it was left to us, if it was only about us, the answer would be no. That's impossible. But thank God, it's not only about us, he wants to have fellowship with us. And He provided a plan for us who can dwell in God's presence? While I believe God has made an avenue for his people, but let me make this even more personal who can dwell in God's presence? And the answer is you can. The Bible not only tells us a story of the people of God in the past, but really we are invited into the story of the gospel. We are participants in what is unfolding for the great plan of God, who can enter into God's presence and dwell in God's presence you can you need to be thankful for that. In Psalm 16, in verse 11, it talks about the great joy of being in God's presence. And it says, you will show me the way of life granting me the joy of your presence and the pleasures of living with you forever. Let us not underestimate or understate the grandeur of being able to dwell in God's presence. And not only that, but we also see in Ephesians, chapter two and verse 13. And he addresses this to the Gentiles. But he says, But now, in Christ Jesus, You who once were far off had been brought near by the blood of Christ, and his reference to you. And if you're a Jew, it has referenced to us well, you've been brought near by the blood of Christ, who can dwell on the presence of God. You can, if you seek to live a godly life and rely upon Jesus Christ as your Savior. Maybe you're here this morning, and you're not a Christian, I beg you to contemplate and consider what it means to dwell in God's presence and the importance of that. You can do that by believing that Jesus is the Christ, confessing that he is the Christ, repenting of your sin, desiring to live a godly life and committing your life to Him, being baptized in the water for the forgiveness of your sin.

Jeremy Sweets  33:52
It may be that you're a Christian this morning and you not been living as you should. Will you automatically go to heaven because you've been baptized? Will you automatically go to heaven? Because you go to worship three times a week or once a week or on an any kind of regular basis? Will that put you into heaven? The answer is no. God knows your heart and seeks after you. And he wants to have fellowship with you. And so let us seek Him with all of our hearts. There's anyone subject to the invitation, please come as we stand and sing at this time.
