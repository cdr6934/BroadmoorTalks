Good morning. It's good to see everyone here today, it's good that we can come here to worship God. We have just finished up an encouraging week with Alan Nader. So if you were not able to attend that, I'll just say that you missed out. But we do have the recordings on our website. So I do encourage you to go and listen to those. Again, if you're unable to hear that I think you will greatly benefit from listening to those lessons. I know that I was extremely encouraged by by his lessons and his his example in his life. And so I'd ask that you go and listen to those. We'd like to spin in a welcome to those that are visiting with us here today. Our goal at Broadmoor is to give God glory and honor and praise and all that we do. And we're glad that you're here with us, we invite you to join with us, we want to tell you about our great God and why we serve Him. So we invite you at this time to open up your Bibles and and study with us as we look at God's word. I'll make a couple other quick comments. And that is I was gonna wear my regular tie this morning. But as you were wore his bow tie, and he asked me to wear something to match. And so you know, what can I do if I had to go with that? I also mentioned that I'm dealing with a little bit of allergies and congestion. I've been feeling fine. But the weather and me don't always mix. So I can't necessarily hear myself. But hopefully you can, you can hear me and hear the lesson. And we shouldn't have too many problems from that. Have you ever noticed in Scripture that one of the images that is often used to talk about the church is the body, the body like to talk for just a few moments this morning about that one body in fact, there are several different times in the New Testament where this imagery is used. There is one body but many members. I believe Conrad's preached on this lesson not too long ago, I was trying to look through the list and find where this was, I'm sure Mike has preached on this several different times. This was a subject that was on my mind. So if, if it's a little bit of a repeat, you'll, you'll forgive me. But maybe you'll be reminded most everything we preach is a repeat, right? So that's okay. One body and many members. Well, let's just look at the times that there is this reminder or this instruction in the New Testament about the fact that there is one body and many members, there appears to be some kind of tension in the church at Corinth based upon class or, or wealth or something along those lines. And Paul uses this imagery to remind them that they are to be one body, and many members. In first Corinthians chapter 10 And verse 17. He reminds them because there is one bread, we who are many are one body, for we all partake of the one bread. And then later in chapter 12, you see really the tension surfaces as he talks about those that were taking of the meal, the Lord's Supper and leaving others out. They were filling themselves, while others were without. And so he warns them in verse 29, that, that anyone who eats and drinks without discerning the body, eats and drinks judgment on himself. Now it may be that the body there refers to the very body of Christ and what he did. But it may be as we look at that, that he seemed to discern or think about or consider the body of Christ speaking of the church, and it very well may be that he has both in mind as his uses this concept of the physical body of Christ. And what he did really is representative of the church and the body. And so when there was tension between different classes of people, we see that Paul use this instruction of the one body with many members to remind them about how they were supposed to act. We see that there was tension even later in this book, about about gifts. I just noticed I said 1229 on that last point. That's 1129 I'm sure you caught that. There was gift tension, when I say that, that there were spiritual gifts that were given to certain individuals, but there seems to be

Jeremy Sweets  04:43
a sense in which they made this out to be a competition. This wasn't about serving the body of Christ the church but rather there was an effort to to have the best gift and I have a better gift than you and they turn this instead of a serving situation into a sin oafish situation. It's funny how we can do that with things that are supposed to be forgotten for service, we turn it into something about ourselves. And so Paul gives instruction in chapter 12, really, that that whole second part of the chapter deals with this. But let me highlight a couple of things that he says in verse 12. He says, For just as the body is Warren, and has many members, and all the members of the body, though many are one body, so it is with Christ, the church, and Christ are to be one body, one body of Christ with many members. In verse 14, he says, For the body does not consist of one member, but many. And again in verse 27, now you are the body of Christ and individually members of and so as they were seeking to serve themselves and seeking out the best so called gift.

Jeremy Sweets  06:06
Paul reminds them that you're one body together, and you're many members, each one of you is necessary and needed. And so you're looking at this completely wrong and trying to outdo or outperform or, or shine the light on yourselves when it comes to the body. And so he provides this instruction or reminder. We also see in Ephesians, chapter two, that there there was tension between races or ethnicities there with the Jew and the Gentile, we see that they had come from different backgrounds, different histories, and so there was tension when they came together as the church and Paul reminds them, that you are one body that Christ has reconciled you into one body, and Ephesians two in verse 16, he says, And he might reconcile us both to God in one body through the cross, thereby killing the hostility. Again, in chapter three and verse six, he says, this mystery is that the Gentiles are fellow heirs, members of the same body, and partakers of the promise in Christ Jesus through the Gospel. And so there were tensions as the early church came together. And Paul and other writers there, we see that they told the people about the one body you are one body and many members of Furthermore, we see just general instructions in Romans chapter 12, verses four and five, in the section where it says to love one another with brotherly affection, and outdo one another, not in selfishness, but in showing on. He says in verses four and five, For as in one body, we have many members, and the members do not all have the same function. So we though many are one body in Christ, and individually members, one of another. You see this repetition all throughout the New Testament that is addressing these different situations. And then in Colossians, chapter three, and I said that this was a general instruction. But if you take into account the situation of the letter, it may be that they were dealing with outside false teachers. And so they had to deal with friction among themselves as they were being influenced to a different degree. And so there was tension with outsiders that brought up this instruction in Colossians, chapter three, there, it says, and above all, these put on love, which binds everything together in perfect harmony. And let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts to which indeed you are called in one body and be thankful. One body, we see that there is many instructions, many reminders throughout the New Testament of being one body, speaking of the church, and yet many members. So that's what I want to talk about and flesh out just a little bit this morning. And I haven't really even emphasize the fact the passages that talk about we are one body and Christ is the head. And so there's several different places that use that illustration to say that talk about our relationship to Christ. And that is certainly a needed piece of the puzzle here. But notice as we talk about one body, what does it mean to be one body and think that points to a unity that the church is to have a unity that the church is to have? Open your Bibles to Ephesians chapter four Ephesians chapter four. I want you to notice in these first few verses, we see that Paul talks about the unity of the Spirit. And I'll start reading in verse one. I, therefore a prisoner for the Lord urge you to walk in a manner worthy of the calling to which you have been called, with all humility and gentleness, with patience, bearing with one another in love, eager to maintain the unity of the spirits, in the bond of peace, the unity of the Spirit, God is one, his word and instruction is one. And so there is a unity in God, and there is a unity for his followers, the unity of the spirits, he goes on to talk about also the bond of peace. This morning, we sang a song, talking about that, instructing ourselves, bind us together, bind us together, there is a bond of peace that the church has, despite the many different backgrounds that we all can come from, despite the many different backgrounds that every person in the world can come from. There is a unity in God, there is a unity in the Gospel. And we need to understand that that does bind us together, that does bind us together. In fact, that's more important than any other difference that we might have the unity of the Spirit, we can all be one as we seek after the gospel and seek to serve God. He goes on to talk about these different ones, in verses four through six. He says, And he starts off, there's one body, there's one body. Now how are we one body, what brings us together what unites the one body? Well, he goes on to talk about that. There is one body and one Spirit, just as you were called, in one hope of your calling, one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and Father of all, who is overall and through all and in all, here, we see that there is one body that are united, that is united in all of these warns, all of these ones. Despite our backgrounds, we serve the same God. There is a unity in God, and we serve that same God and in the form of, of God, the Father, Jesus, our Lord, God, the Spirit, there is one law, there's one direction that we have as we serve that God. And so we have one faith together. You know, there's lots of different education levels. There's lots of different cultural beliefs. And there's lots of differences when it comes to our mind. But the church can be united in the faith of the gospel, we believe that there is one God and we're going to serve Him with all of our minds. Despite any differences that we might have, we can come together in our faith. And so we can say, with people across the world, from different classes, from different races, different genders, we can talk about the like precious faith, the same faith that we have. And that's true, not only today, but throughout turn, we can reach back hundreds of years to other people and say that we have the same faith, we have the same direction in that faith, and we're going in the same play go into the same place, we have the same goal, we have a hope of heaven. That means that we're all working together for the same thing. We are, we are looking forward to, we have our vision set on the exact same thing. We want the same thing with other Christians, we have committed ourselves to God and we've been initiated if you want to use that word in the one baptism, all Christians can say and should be able to say that, that I can look back to my baptism, and I share that with other Christians. And as we do that, we can see that we were buried with Christ. And we were buried in such a way that we put to death the old man, all Christians should be able to share that statement. They put to death, the old man of sin. All Christians should be able to say that they've been raised to walk in newness of life, that they have committed themselves to following after God to living according to His purpose. And despite what background they had and what sin they lived after. All Christians say my mind is on serving God. And I've got maybe a different past, but my future is committed to serving God. And so we see a unity in that so many differences in the world. But Christians can and should be united, united in these fundamental, basic facts. But even though they're fundamental, let us not minimise, in any way and disregard these, these are core. These are the things that we can rally around. These are the things that we base our lives upon. And so we need to understand this is the unity of the Spirit and the bond of peace. And we need to seek after that. It's interesting that, that as he talks about that, this, there's so much unity that shouldn't be there. But yet the New Testament Church, and I think churches today still have to work at that. And so it doesn't automatically come, it doesn't descend upon us, you automatically have units, you automatically have peace and all things. Now we have to live according to our calling. And that's what it says in Ephesians chapter four, according to our purpose, we have to live out our profession, we have to live according to what we've said. So there is one body, one church, we have many members within this body, many members. As we think about the gospel, we need to understand that the gospel is for all the gospel is for everyone. You know, there are religions that have been throughout time that have been

Jeremy Sweets  16:17
based upon a certain nation, I think of Shinto ism, when it comes to Japan, there are other religions that are for a certain race. But the gospel is not that way. The gospel is for all people. The gospel is for all nationalities. The gospel is for all races. The gospel is for all languages and cultures and backgrounds. The gospel is for all social status. The gospel is for every different amount of money that you make from rich to poor, the gospel is for both male and female, the gospel is for all. Now, if we believe that that is going to affect how we live, and how we take the Gospel to others, and what we do with the gospel, the gospel is for all. And so if the gospel is for all, let me also say that the church is for all the churches for all those that that have accepted the gospel. And remember, the gospel is going to everybody of every different background. So that means that the church also is for all, all those that would have that good soil, the heart, notice, it's really what's on the inside, that determines whether we're going to follow God and be his disciple. It's not on the outside. We focus so much on the outside, don't we, when it comes to breaking people apart and looking at the differences. God's not concerned with that we spent a lot of energy and time thinking about that and dwelling on that that's not God's concern, not his primary concern. He cares about the heart. That's what he is looking for. And so the church is for all, and we need to understand that we need to be prepared for that. We need to be welcoming of that fat. Differences is not something to be upset about. But it's something that brings a goodness, it's something that proclaims a message of, despite these differences, we can be one in Christ. You know what, and we can just by our very existence, proclaim that to the world. In a world that is fighting and bickering over so many things. The church has the potential to be a loud message of unity, of what we are doing and what we are following. The church is for all Galatians 328 says There is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is need no male and female for you're all one in Christ Jesus. Many differences. But really, those don't matter when it comes to the gospel. You are one in Christ Jesus, there's no second rate citizens when it comes to the gospel. There's not some that are elevated. There's not some that are second class and you need to sit in the back, you know, we'll put the important members on front. That's not the way the gospel works in the church works. There are some people in the New Testament that tried to implement that and they refute the gospel is for all the churches for all and we all have an equal claim and stake and value before God because of the fact that we were made in His image. And so we see that we are all one in Christ Jesus, that's true of every race, class and gender is what is pointed out in this passage, all one in the Gospel may point to some other differences that we might see here at Broadmoor. We have young people, middle aged and elderly. I think that covers the gamut. And I'll let you put yourself in whatever category you see fit there. But we need to understand that, that there are these differences. But we need to value these differences. Young people, you are valuable here at Broadmoor, we need you. We need you desperately. We need your energy. We need your ability to be excited about things we need your your eagerness to learn. We need your humility. We need your attitude. We need you here at Rob. You're valuable, extremely valuable. And it's not said enough. But young people we need you, middle aged, you're fighting through jobs and kids and different things there. You're valuable here at Broadmoor,

Jeremy Sweets  21:01
you're needed, you're very much needed. We need people that have established themselves and working places and have contacts with other people. We need people that are raising godly families. We need middle aged people that are single and seeking to serve God to the best of their ability being an example to others middle aged, sure valuable and needed at Broadmoor, the elderly. You're not forgotten. You're an example of a life of perseverance. You're an example of faith in so many different ways in so many different years. You don't have maybe the energy that the young have. But you have wisdom. And you have lived a godly life. You are valuable here at Broadmoor, so very valuable. We need you. And so we see that there are many different members at Broadmoor. There are married couples, marrieds. We need you at Broadmoor. And it may seem like that's the biggest group and then might go without saying we need you. We need you here and your valuable. We talk about lessons that go with marries and that's that's needed. Those that are widowed, or maybe divorced, your special and needed at Broadmoor may feel like you don't fit in because you're not part of the biggest group of marries, but you are vital. You're needed here. And I want you to understand that those that are single may be the same situation where most people here are married, I don't fit in I don't belong. But that's not true. You're valuable. You're so needed. You are needed here at Broadmoor. Please don't think anything else. And so we as a group, need to welcome and be inclusive all those I'll have a few more comments about that in just a moment. Those that are new Christians, you're valuable. You may think I'm not as valuable as somebody that's been a Christian for a long time. But but God disagrees, you're needed as part of the body, your eagerness and you're willing to grow your your experiences as you you've made a commitment that's encouraging to other people. That's encouraging to those that have been Christians for a long time. They love to see those that have committed their life to God, and are growing, those that are experienced Christians, you are valuable and you are needed here at Broadmoor. Now, there's many other differences I could talk about here at Broadmoor, but those are a few that came to my mind. And so those, every single member here is valuable. And as needed, is necessary. First Corinthians 12 makes that point, you know, there's hands and eyes, there's different parts of the body that do different functions. You know, sometimes we think to ourselves, you know, I wish I could do what they did. That is common. That is so common. I wish they could do what they did. But if everybody were a hand, or if everybody were an eye, there would be so much that is unknown. And so every person is needed, the differences are really celebrated. And the vibe is something that is is important to making up and building up the body. And so you have something to contribute. You have something to contribute to the body. And that's important for you to soak in. There is something for you to do. There is some way that you can help. And it may be that you don't know what that is. And you might have to look a little bit more for that. But you can be a servant, and we need you to be a servant. We need you to be a servant. So let's talk about building up the body, building up the body. If we are to build up the body, we need to first of all know the body. I've been a member at the YMCA for, I don't know how long 1015 years, often going by lunches to go work out. And so I've been there for a long time. One of the things that they'll do, and I don't know if they've always done this, but I've noticed this at certain times, is when they scan your little card for you to get in, you know, your name pops up there, but they make an effort to say your name. It's good to have you here today, Jeremy. You know, that makes a difference. Knowing someone's name, and I know they cheat a little bit. But knowing someone's name is important. You know, if you don't even know someone's name, there's this sense of, you know, I

Jeremy Sweets  25:57
don't belong, and they don't even know who I am, I'm just a number. But if you have the power of knowing someone's name, I'm an individual. They know me. And so we need to let me just start off by saying, as a body, we need to know everybody's name. Alan Nader encouraged me in this. And again, I'll say, I believe he has a great mind and a good memory. But really, I don't think that's the key to him knowing so many names. I think the key to him knowing so many names is he saw it as valuable. And he made the effort. And so let us make the is there someone here you don't know their name? Go up and ask them. I'm sorry, I should know your name. But let me know look at the directory. But make it a priority to know people's names and call their name, say their name. That is just a small key. In fact, if I were to draw and stretch out a, a line from from casual to intimate as far as the relationship goes, you know, that would be on the left side. But that's key and getting to know somebody. So get to know their name, know their name, call their name, no more than that I was a little bit embarrassed and ashamed, as is Alan Nader came over to our house on Monday night. And we also had Wes come with us. And he was asking me some things about Wes. And I said, I don't know. I didn't know everything about Wes that I did. You know what, when when Wes showed up? Alan knew, because he asked him, he talked to him. He asked me how do you know this and he made connections with he made an effort there to get to know who he was what some basic things about him, you know, and that helps in the relationship field. Somebody's has a sick child, you can say how is your so and so doing? Or if their mother is sick, you can ask about that, that shows an interest in one another. So let me just say, try to know one another. Not only that, but welcome each other in Romans chapter 15. There the instruction is to welcome one another in Christ to receive one another and Romans 15 And verse seven. We need to be welcoming, not only to every single member here, but every single person that would walk through the door that may not be a member that may be thinking about the gospel, we need to be welcoming. You know, I mentioned that the gospel is for all there's many different backgrounds, there's many differences. What would you think of someone that came in here with a green Mohawk? Would you begin to say, Did you see that PERT? Can you believe you know, I would never have that hairstyle? I'm just wanting some hair myself, you know? Or would you go up to them and welcome them? Who cares what their hair looks like? You know, that person may have no experience whatsoever with the gospel or they come in a little weary of Christians who they've heard or judgmental. And now they come in with maybe tattoo sleeves. Did you see what they look like? Is that our approach? Are we so focused on the outside that we forget that there is a soul and a heart inside each and every individual? So let us as a body be welcoming. Let's be welcoming to any visitor that would come. Homosexuals come and sit down, holding hands in our building. What are we going to do? Not I'll say right now, there will be some teaching that needs to happen. That will not just be acceptable forevermore, but They might not know the gospel or heard it. And so what are we going to do? Start whispering? Can you believe that? I would never do that? Or are we going to welcome them with a smiling face? Open Arms? Do we have clenched fists? No, I'm cold. Sometimes I do this a lot more than I would like to? Or do we have open arms? What? What vibe are we giving to others? That's true of those that are visitors. But it's also true of members here. It's also true of members here. There are those that are single here that feel left out. I'll just say that, frankly, I've heard that from others, there may be some that don't feel left out. But Are we welcoming to each member? I know you've got your friends and your kids have their friends and you do things with them?

Jeremy Sweets  30:55
There's nothing wrong with that. But do we make every member feel welcome? Do you know there are married families that don't have kids that feel left out? Everybody seems to have kids. So what are we doing to welcome them? You know, there are married couples, with kids that feel left out and you say how could that be? They're running so ragged, they don't have time to socialize, they're go here and there. And they simply feel left out. You know, there's no no matter what group if we go back to those ages, there are elderly here that feel left out. Because they they don't, they don't have the same situation life situation of others. And so what can we do about that? We need to reach outside of ourselves. And we need to be welcoming to everybody. We know their name, right? And so we go and talk to them, ask how they're doing. We don't simply bundle up with the same people and talk about the same things. That's not what the church does. The church is welcoming. And we receive one another. So let us be busy and thinking about that. We esteem one another. One of the instructions in Philippians. Chapter Two is that we would look not only to our own interests, but also to the interests of others that we would not be not be arrogant, but in humility, we would count others more significant than ourselves. I quoted those verses in reverse order. Just to see if you're checking. Not really. The first one came out and then oh, yeah, get verse three. Okay. So esteem one another, or count others more significant than yourself. That is the gospel message. You know, Jim was asking about why study about Christ. He is one that lowered himself for others. What a lesson. That's what the church is to do. And let me give you a few ways that that you can do that. I'm up here, I'm speaking, you know, every lesson is not my best and you come away saying, I didn't understand what he was saying there. That one didn't make sense. Or you know what he, Conrad already talked about that here. We don't need to talk about that again. Or he just, he's not a good speaker. You know what, instead of coming away saying things like that. Be gracious. Be gracious. You know, Jeremy's doing the best he can. And that is true. And I worked on this lesson, and I don't always get things in the right order. I don't always get things right. I haven't always practice things as much as I need to. But Be gracious to others. What about when somebody comes up here and talks about married couples? Today, we're going to talk about the family. You say? I don't have a family. That's all we talk about here. Well, be gracious. Understand that there are others that need that lesson. Preachers, talk about the family but talk about other things as well include others don't just focus on one family. But in everything what we're doing there is instead of turning the focus on me, you know, I didn't get anything from that lesson. He didn't feed me I don't like that teacher or preacher. You know, that's a very me focused attitude. That's not rooting for the person. I want them to succeed I want them to do well you know, I didn't get that point. But you know, I got this other point. That was important. So be gracious to others be kind count them more significant than yourselves. If you are used to hanging out with a crown I don't have a married I have kids and so we're gonna have talked to others that are married have kids. Well, that may be enjoyable and that's fine and good but esteem others more Significant than yourself don't allow that to be the determining factor who you're going to socialize with, reach out to those that are elderly, or in a different demographic, or those that are single or those that don't have kids reach out, count them more significant than yourself. You see the gospel demands, the Gospel demands that we lower ourselves, and we raise others up. If we go back to that list of frictions in the church, so much stems from a failure to do just that.

Jeremy Sweets  35:34
We elevate ourselves, and we lower others. And that's the opposite of what we are to do. So let us count others more significant than ourselves in our attitudes and in our actions. Let us show sacrificial love. Jesus gave Himself for others, because he loved them. Let us love the church of God, let us love the individual members. Let us follow the example of our Lord and Savior and sacrifice of ourselves. Sacrifice of what we want for the betterment of others. Love means not always doing what someone else wants, but seeking their best interest. And so some of that's going to involve snowing and welcoming and a steaming but as we see love here it is a sacrifice. And it is putting others before yourself and loving them. Let us be a loving people. Let us encourage I was extremely encouraged by Alan Yadier and his meeting, I've mentioned that I know, I've said that before. But he sought to know people's names, you know, I can't preach on one of the things I thought I can't preach like Alan, you know, his introductions are, he starts naming people and he's looking at individuals. And when I was over your house, and then he gets into his lesson, I can't do that. I can't do that. But I can't encourage. I'm not trying to be Alan, we shouldn't try to be other people. But we can encourage, we can do what we can. So you may feel like I'm on the fringe. Well, don't worry about those things, but serve, find who you can serve, find who you can encourage, use words, write letters. You know, find out what people are discouraged with. And seek to encourage them stir up one another to love and good works. It says in Hebrews chapter 10, we need to serve others as well. Jesus was a servant, his disciples are to be servants. And so we must actively do for others. When others need meals, we need to be quick to supply that when others are sick, we need to be quick to reach out to them. We need to maybe not be imposing but instead of saying, just let me know what I can do. There's very few people are gonna say, well, here's my list. So maybe say what I would like to do is, you know, Can I Can I have your child and watch them for a couple hours? And and I know you've been stressed with things and you know, they very well might take you up on that, can I can I come by and visit? Would that be alright, I can do that Tuesday night. Or write a letter or fill in the blank. You know, there's not a list of rules telling you exactly what to do. There is a need for engaging your mind and being creative and thinking about others. So I don't I don't necessarily have that list. But I think we need to engage ourselves and other people. Think about what we can do. Think about what we can do. There is one body, but many members. And we need to pray for one another. When you know people's names, and you know their situations, and you know, their difficulties. It's easy to take those names and those situations and those difficulties to God our Father. You may say I don't have the ability that this person does. Can you pray? No, certainly you can. You can pray, do not minimize the importance of prayer. Don't think that that's Oh, that all I can do is pray. All you can do is petition the God of heaven, the creator of the unit. That's not a small thing. So let us be like Paul, Paul said, I'm praying for you. The thing about policy said that to everybody, and I think he was constantly praying for the browser. For those that are sisters in Christ, those that are Christians, I'm praying for you. I'm praying for this church. Let us be a praying people. I've learned it helps make lists, because I don't have a great memory. So take the note, the worksheet may be that you have that's given out weekly to talk about the needs of members, or if you listen to the announcements, take note of those things. I don't want to keep harping on Alan, I'm sorry to do this.

Maybe I can do that, because he's not here. But I noticed him on Monday night. He was paying attention as much at any time is when the announcements were going on. Now, he doesn't go here. He's not a member here. He may not be fully involved, but but he was listening, what are the needs of this congregation? Announcements are important. That's not the time, oh, lessons all around me fumble, get all my stuff. That's the time when you can start thinking, Wait, here's an opportunity for me. And you're listening. That's something I can pray about. That's somebody I can reach out to. That's a situation that I need to help with. That's why the announcements are made. In part. So let us be a praying people. There's many more items on this list that we could pull out, there's many more things that we could do. There's many more topics within this subject of being one body and many members that we can discuss. But I hope and pray that these have been beneficial to you. It's been on my heart and on my mind. And it's been something I think that I know, I need to do better at, I need to grow, I need to build up the body. And I need to be focused on helping us be united and the gospel message. Maybe you're here this morning and you're not a Christian. If you're not a Christian, you have an opportunity to obey the gospel. The gospel is for you. Don't think it's for just the person next to you or just the person that's got it all together, so to speak. That's not the case. The gospel is for you. The gospel tells us that Jesus Christ died on the cross for you and for your sins. And you must believe that He is the Christ, repent of your sins, confess that Jesus is the Christ and be baptized into water for the remission of your sins. When you're baptize you put to death, the old man and there's a picture of that and baptism, you bury your main site, that life of sin, he's dead to me. I'm not going to do that anymore. But you're raised to walk in newness of life. And so that's a beautiful picture. If you're here this morning, and you are a Christian, you have made a commitment, a lifelong commitment to serve Him. And if you've given up on that you need to make changes this very day. If there's anybody in this audience that's subject to the invitation, please come as we stand and sing at this time.
