Good morning. Good to see everyone here. I'll say good morning to those that are watching online. I think we have more than normal that are watching online as well. It's good to be here and it's good to reflect on God and and the scriptures. We are living in unusual times, you likely know that as far as what's been going on last few days, I've prayed that, that my words would be beneficial. I realize that I'm speaking to people that probably have all different levels of anxiety from those that are very nervous to those that are dismissing much of what we've seen. And so I pray that the words that I have for you this morning would be beneficial and that God would be glorified. I am going to offer some words in relation to the virus that is spreading. How could I talk about anything else? Talking about what is on your mind. On December 31 2019, the Chinese government confirmed dozens of cases of pneumonia from an unknown unknown cause was only a week later that the outbreak was identified as the new Coronavirus and has been since identified as COVID-19 the specific type of Coronavirus as I understand it, and under a month the infection had spread to Thailand, Japan and South Korea with the first confirmed us case on January 21 2020. On January 30, right at a month after it was first identified the World Health Organization declared the outbreak of Global Public Health Emergency with more than 9000 cases reported by Mark six the outbreak hit 100,000 global cases. And so we're looking at March was it 15th today and so we're talking about pretty recently, from March 15. Today, or just within the last couple of weeks, it hit 100,000 global cases. On March 11, the World Health Organization declared the situation a pandemic. And today, we've seen in this past week, our country practically shut down taking the unprecedented step of canceling nearly all sporting events, tournaments, public gatherings, and, and things like that people are being asked to work at home. I've never seen this in my life. And I don't think we've seen something like this in any of your lifetimes. So how should a Christian respond to a global pandemic? Oh, to offer some words from scripture, but also look at history to see what a Christians response has been and should be to this pandemic? How should we act? What should we think? In some ways, we're not going to be thinking any differently than we do normally. In fact, that's part of the point is that weird. We don't jettison our faith at a time like this, we hold on even tighter. And so much of what I say will probably not be that unusual to you and not be that different, but it's how we need to live. It's what we need to remember, at this time. First, I would suggest that we need to live with faith and not fear, faith and not fear.

Jeremy Sweets  03:35
Fear is contagious fear is spreading. As I thought about this pandemic, I realized that there are many in fact, in fact, Mike mentioned some of those other outbreaks that have happened throughout time. He mentioned some in the last 20 years. But throughout history, there have been many situations like this many outbreaks many with more severe things than then what we are seeing today. But we do have something different that is the internet, our ability to communicate. So part of the reason why we're not facing some of the the the challenge that maybe they are in China, for example is that we've been told what to do the information has got out. And so we may be able to avoid some things that that earlier generations were not be able to avoid. That also means we may have some anxiety that earlier generations didn't have because we hear about all the troubles in all the world we begin to internalize those. And so we begin to have fear. But Jesus urged us to have faith to rely on him and not to worry. In Matthew six and 25 it says Therefore I tell you, do not be anxious about your life what you will eat or what you will drink, not about your body what you will put on It's not life more than food and the body more than clothing. Jesus goes on to say that you need to look to the birds of the air. They do not toil nor do they work. Yet God our father takes care of each one of them, look to the lilies in the field, God also cares for them and provides and after a short time, they die and wither. In verse 31, he says, Therefore, do not be anxious for the Gentile, seek all after all these things and your heavenly Father knows that you need them all. But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you. Therefore do not be anxious about tomorrow for tomorrow will be anxious for itself. Sufficient for the day is its own trouble. As Christians, we have trust in our Heavenly Father. And we need to remember that we are not here alone, facing life alone, but we have our Heavenly Father. In 1948, the world was just three years removed from World War Two. Fear was gripping the world at that time, as well. A new danger was threatening the world and this was not a disease, but the atomic bomb. The atomic bomb was used in 1945 On two occasions in Japan, and it virtually ended the war there. But that did not end the use of the bomb. In fact, the technology was only growing and increasing so that people began to fear. What would happen if the bomb if nuclear war occurred? CS Lewis addressed this fear in 1948, he wrote a statement on living in an atomic age. And I thought what he had to say regarding that situation might be helpful for us as well.

Jeremy Sweets  06:59
He said this. In one way, we think a great deal too much of the atomic bomb. How are we to live in an atomic age? I am tempted to reply, why as you would have lived in the 16th century, when the plague visited London almost every year, whereas you would have lived in a Viking age when writers from Scandinavia, Scandinavia, might land and cut your throat any night. Or indeed, as you're already living in the age of cancer, an age of syphilis, an age of paralysis, an age of air raids, an age of railway, re railway accidents, an age of motor accidents. In other words, do not let us begin by exaggerating the novelty of our situation. Believe me, dear sir, madam you and all whom you love, we're already sentenced to death before the atomic bomb was invented. This is the first point to be made. And the first action to be taken is to pull ourselves together. If we're all going to be destroyed by an atomic bomb, let that bomb when it comes find us doing sensible and human things, praying, working, teaching, reading, listening to music, bathing the children playing tennis, chatting to our friends over a pint in a game of darts, not huddled together like frightened sheep and thinking about bones. They may break our bonds, a microbe can do that. But they need not dominate our minds. You see what he's saying there? I'm not suggesting you take the pint. I'm sure he's talking about a pint of lemonade, right? That's not what he's talking about. And I'm not suggesting that but I hope we can see his point. Lewis argues that death is certain for all of us. And we need not be those that ignore that facts, nor are paralyzed by that fact. We need to live this life. We do not live in fear. If we do that, we're really wasting the precious time that God has given us we all have limited time. So let us use that living life, living life. Let us not be overcome with fear and dread. That is no way to live. I think he has some good advice and advice we need to listen to. Another thing that a Christian should keep in mind is that we need to live with love, not intolerance, practice love with others. That includes being gracious and giving them the benefit of the doubt. I know that as some wrote into our group text about whether they would attend services. I know there was some feeling of guilt. I can't be there. There's a need to provide a reason. You know, I'm having this sick. We will all want to be here. I appreciate Jeremy's comments. We thank you for staying home because we realize you're not staying home out of selfish This or because you dislike church at all, but we know you're trying to make the best decision in regards to others. Well, we need to practice love at this time. In Ephesians chapter four and verse two, there Paul instruct us instructs us to forbear with our brethren especially in matters of judgment and not sin. And actually, those are my words, not Paul's. Paul's words start in verse two, with all humility and gentleness, with patience, bearing with one another in love. We must practice love and charity for other people at this time, give others the benefit of the doubt extend grace to them. Now, the thing that the internet has done for us is it, it has empowered many of us to speak our mind at any and every time. If you look on the internet, which can be a dangerous thing, judgments are flying all over the place. And that's not really the place of a Christian. Christ even came said that I didn't come to judge but I came to say, we need to be careful with our judgments. Philippians two verses three and four says do nothing from selfish ambition or conceit. But in humility, count others more significant than yourselves. Let each of you look not only to his own interest, but also to the interests of others. We need to practice love considering other people considering their situation considering maybe even their fears, considering what they are facing, and not just what we are facing.

Jeremy Sweets  11:42
In the mid 14th century, the Black Death struck and it was one of the most deadly outbreaks in all of human history. It killed between 1/3 and one half of the European population at that time. The plague then reemerged every few years and one of those times was in Wittenberg, then Berg in the early 16th century. And at that time, some argued that Christians should not flee from the plague since it was God's judgment, and it should be received with submission. Martin Luther wrote a piece about that question in 1527. He wrote a letter entitled whether one may flee from a deadly plague and I thought his words may be helpful for us this morning. First of all, he encouraged those in public offices and services to remain. He said public officials and city workers and those that are helping others should not flee unless they furnish capable substitutes. Likewise, if you have sick children or a sick neighbor, he urged those people to stay and help do not abandon your responsibilities because of the sickness. He says we are obliged to help them. But he goes on to say where no such emergency exists a judge that they are free either to flee or to remain, to flee from death and to save one's life as a natural tendency and planted by God and not forbidden, unless it be against God and neighbor. He would also say that if this truly is God's judgment, there's nothing we can do to avoid it. God will have his way. He goes on also to argue for the use of wisdom. He says use medication. Use medicine, take Posten potions, which can help you fumigate your house, your yard and your street. Shun persons in places wherever your neighbor does not need your presence and act like someone who wants to put out the burning city. So he says use wisdom at a time like this use your judgment. He furthermore argued and closed out his case by saying that love for our neighbors should be our guiding principle in all things, whether it be actively helping them in their presence, or maybe even stay in a way to avoid the spread of the play. To summarize, Luther argues that our responsibilities to others does not end at a time of crisis or widespread sickness. Neither is it sinful to take precautions to care for one's own life. And I would extend that same advice to you as well. Martin Luther had some things to say about a deadly plague in the 16th century. As Christians, we need to also live with service and not selfishness service and not selfishness. Jesus took it upon himself to engage in a dirty, mundane, unwanted job of washing the disciples feet. It wasn't a glamorous job, but it was needed. And he said in John 13 and verse 14, if I then your Lord and teach have washed your feet, you also ought to wash one another's feet. Jesus says, imitate my example, serve one another. Service usually does not mean something that's noticed. Something that's glamorous, service can be a dirty job. Service can be something that deals with something like washing other people's dirty feet. The Bible encourages Christians to be servants in Galatians six and verse one. There it says, Bear one another's burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ. In verse 10, it goes on to say, so then as we have opportunity, let us do good to everyone. And especially those are who are the household of faith. Christians are to be known for serving for doing good. And at this time, we need to be focused on serving. And there's many ways you could do that you can do that in the presence of someone that needs your help. It may be that you're Shut up in your home and you can extend words of encouragement, you can make phone calls and things that you don't necessarily do in people's presence. You can pray, there are many things that we can do. But what I'm saying is that we need to be service minded, service minded.

Jeremy Sweets  16:21
In Nashville in 1873, there was a cholera epidemic, a cholera epidemic, many people were fleeing the city to get away from the epidemic. There were about 25,000 people in the city of Nashville at that time. And in the month of June, there are about 650 people that died. And overall through this cholera epidemic, there are about 1000 people that die. So that's one in 25 people, and a number of the size of Broadmoor, a 200. That's about eight people of our number that would have died there this time. Many of the people that were affected were those that were poor. And this included, especially the African American community that was hit the hardest. While people were fleeing the city, though, David Lipscomb went from 10 miles outside of the city to inside the city. And he did that so that he could extend help where needed. He transported Catholic nuns and the mannequins as they were going about their rounds and helping others. And he also personally cared for the sick and dying, including many African Americans. He reflected on this epidemic in a piece entitled The cholera and the Christian religion. And he said this, to reproduce the life of Christ in our own lives is to act as Christ would act where he in our places, we thus become Christ representatives to the world. The solemn pledge of our lives is to act to the best of our ability in the various relationships that we occupy in the world and in the excellent distances. Don't make me say that again. And circumstances in which we are placed this Christ would act, where he here situated as we are, let's go stated that recently, the cholera made a fearful visit visitation upon our people, he spoke of the wild panic that sees the population. He urged the weak and susceptible to seek refuge beyond the reach of the disease. But he said this, but for able bodied men and women to be flying from the city, when their brethren and neighbors and fellow creatures are suffering and dying for lack of attention and help is such a contradiction in ideas, to be Christ's representatives requires that we act as Christ would act and minister to those in need. He says that we need to extend that to other people. We are Christ representatives. I'm not suggesting we rush into sickness, again, there are considerations to be made here as far as what we might spread in that. But what I am saying is that, that we don't leave our Christian faith behind because of the situation. Okay? We are to be service minded. We are to be thinking of others, and not just ourselves. We may want to hide our head in the sand and hope that this all blows over. But that's not what Christ did or would do. And neither should it be what we do. We need to seek how we can serve and again use wisdom as you do that, but serving is not an option for a Christian. Okay. I think he had some good advice for us to consider. Another aspect that we need to keep in mind a Christian should respond to this situation with hope and not despair. Despair comes when we look at the situation and we feel like there is no positive outcome that could possibly come. We look at the situation and we See only doom in its place, we realize or think that we realize that that we will only suffer nothing good can come. But that never describes the mindset of the Christian. Because there is always hope. There is always hope. The Scripture reminds us that Christian for Christians, even if there is not hope, in this life, things are not fixed in this life, we have hope, in the time to come, we have hope in the living God. In first Peter one, verses three through five, he says this,

Jeremy Sweets  20:39
according to His great mercy He has caused us to be born again to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, to an inheritance that is imperishable, undefiled and unfading kept in heaven for you, who by God's power, being guarded through faith for a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time. Notice what he says about our living hope. He says, first of all, it is like living hope. It is found through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead. Now, not only that, but it is an inheritance, he says that is in perishable, urn defiled, and fading and kept or reserved in heaven for you. I can't help but think about some of the scenes I've seen lately. I went to the grocery store on Friday, as I was going there, I didn't see anybody I said, nobody's out. But when I got to the grocery store, I realized they're all right here. And as I went to get some, some cereal or different things, the aisles were starting to be missing the food, they were being cleared out. I've seen scenes I've not attempted to go to Costco myself, but I've seen scenes of wild panic of trying to buy out why because we might miss out. We need what is there and there is this fear that there won't be enough. You understand that Heaven is not like that. We don't have to rush to be the first in life, it is reserved in heaven for you. There is a place that is kept for you. We show up the cost code, the the the aisles are all wiped up and we say I need this item. And they say I've got this one just for you. Well, we don't get that with things, do we but God says that for us. We live the faithful life. We're there. And God says, I have this place just for you. You don't have to worry about a no vacancy sign. You don't have to worry about the fact that it's filled up or they're all taken. Now we have a living hope. And we should hope and not despair. Like Nashville, London faced the cholera epidemic of its own. You may have heard CS Lewis mentioned that that happened in 1854. And that was just three years before the one in Nashville. And so it was something that was happening around the world. Man then Charles Spurgeon preached at the new Park Street chapel, and he was across the street from the Broad Street neighborhood that was so deeply affected by this crisis. He too, like David Lipscomb took it upon himself to minister to those in need. And he talked about the many things that he saw in his autobiography. He said, during that epidemic of cholera, though I had many engagements in the country, I gave them all up that I might remain in London to visit the sick and died. I felt that it was my duty to be on the spot in such a time of disease and death and sorrow. He was content consistently and constantly being called to help to minister and he saw many scenes of sorrow and sadness. He was called to the grave continually as people died from from this horrible disease. And he saw a lot of sadness. But he also mentions that there were times that he saw joy. There were times and rare times that that he was able to see contentment. He says this about one occasion, I went home and was soon called away again, that time to see a young woman. She also was in the last extremity, but it was a fair fair sight. She was seeing though she knew she was dying, and talking to those around about her telling her brothers and sisters to follow her to heaven, bidding goodbye to her father, and all the while smiling as if it had been her marriage day. She was happy and blessed. How could someone face death with that attitude? A Christian can face death with that attitude. You know, we have been sanitized in this country, for a lot of the problems that the world has faced throughout history because of advancements in modern medicine from things that we see we're extending life and there's a lot of pain. and sorrow that we don't necessarily always see in this life. But that has been the the truth throughout history. Let us not get too comfortable in this life and think that this life is what it's all about. This woman could face death with a happy heart because she had a hope in God in heaven that was reserved for her. And she bet everyone she knew to come there, so that she could meet again.

Jeremy Sweets  25:32
If we were to face a death, if we were to get a terminal illness, how would we face that? What would our attitude be? Would it be despair, thinking this is the end nothing good could come? Or would it be recognizing that we may not find everything that we would like to in this life, but this life is not all there is? There is more, there is heaven, and there is being with God? I think we can learn a lot from this young woman's example. Let me also add that we need to practice proclamation and not avoidance Mike talked about this a little bit this morning at the Lord safe suffer. When we protect the Lord's Supper, we are proclaiming the Lord's death and that He will come again that that He will come again and make all things right. We need to be a people of proclamation. We need to be a people that are busy spreading, not virus, not sickness, if we can help it but our faith, that is something that we do need to spread. First Timothy 315 talks about the church, the people. They're the pillar and support of the truth. Isaiah 52 And verse seven, which again is quoted in Romans, Qin, how beautiful upon the mountains or the feet of him who brings good news, who publishes peace, who brings good news of happiness, who publishes salvation, who says design your God reigns, your God reigns. The Cyprian plague as it was called, and in the Roman Empire from years 249 to 262, was named after a bishop there, Cyprian who wrote about it. And it was a time of great despair. Across the region. There were many people that were were dying, in fact, at its height, up to 5000 people a day were dying. And so it was a terrible sickness that was facing the people. You CBS wrote about the plague. And he noted the different attitudes that manifested themselves among among the people there. And he wrote in his Ecclesiastical History, most of our brethren showed love and loyalty and not sparing themselves why, while helping one another, tending to the sick with no thought of danger, and gladly departing this life with him after becoming infected with their disease. The heathen he says was the exact opposite. They pushed away those with the first signs of the disease and fled from their dearest. Now, it's interesting to note the different attitudes I will offer a word of warning, this is not a us against them, who can do the most good if people are not Christians. We need to rejoice in whatever good they do. But Christians need to focus on what we are doing, doing as far as helping and having the right kind of attitude. Eusebius says that when other people saw the attitude of Christians as they face the sickness and death, that that Christianity was spread, and it was noticeably spread throughout this time, people could see a distinction and a difference between the way people respond, people could see a difference in the life, the mindsets and the actions of Christians, and the faith was spread. Going back to Charles Spurgeon, he said this and I want to add his comment here. He said, If there ever be a time when the mind is sensitive, it is when death is abroad. I recollect when I first came to London, how anxiously people listened to the Gospel, for the cholera was raging terribly, that there was little scoffing then there may be fear now but

Jeremy Sweets  29:43
we have something to offer. I don't want to say we're taking advantage of that fear but but maybe we are we because we have something that can ease that pain. Not necessarily everything that happens in this life, but we can offer people Christ and point people to Christ, we need to remember that people are hurting, and people need Christ. So let us not hide our head in the sand. But let us be busy proclaiming in whatever way that we can. It may be that we proclaimed through the way that we live, it may be that we would proclaim with the words that we speak, it may be that we proclaim and the mentality that we display and the compassion, but whatever it is, remember what Lipscomb said he said, We are representatives of Christ, we are his feet, and his hands and his mouth. And so we need to be busy spreading the gospel. Yes, even at a time, like this. So let me summarize and have some reminders, as we think about this lesson in total. First of all, we need to put things in perspective, I understand that people are afraid. And there's a reason for that fear is you think about a sickness that would spread like this. But we need to put things in perspective, this is we're not unique. This is not the first time in history that something like this has happened. But there have been many times faced like this before. And we need to have the right mindset, we need to remember things. And so putting things in perspective means we don't swing too wildly one way or the other, totally disregarding any need for hygiene or worrying about that because we get to be in heaven. I don't think that's healthy. And it's not healthy to swing the other way to say we're destined to die, and there's nothing we can do, and it's the end of the world. Now, we need to put things in perspective, in this perspective of Scripture, in the perspective of knowing that God is is true, and God is there. We need to remember who we are, and have our minds renewed daily. As it says in Romans chapter 12. We also need to pray to our Heavenly Father, I hope we realize that this is not something that we can simply contain. We're not in complete control here are we, we try to take some steps to do what we can. But ultimately, God is in control. Ultimately, we need to be praying to God, we need to pray to our Heavenly Father, that what is best might come about, we need to pray to Him and rely upon his wisdom. We can ask for comfort for those that are hurting, we can ask for the sickness that it would not be not spread. And that wherever it is that people might realize their need for Christ. We can pray to our Heavenly Father, and we need to be praying in a busy praying people. There are many prayers that we've talked about as a group over the last few days, and I hope we are praying regularly. The world needs our prayers. God wants our prayers, and we need to pray. Let us also at this time, acknowledge human frailty and even death. As CS Lewis said, we're all going to die. And that was true before the atom bomb that was true before the COVID virus outbreak, right? We're all going to die. We are weak. As a people. We may you know a strong person may live 20 more years than a weak person. That's the difference. But we all will die. All die. I don't mean for this to be morbid. I don't mean to harp on this, but Christians have to understand this. This fact we can't ignore it. We're all gonna die. So the point is, make the most of your life. Make the most of your time here make a decision to serve God. There's nothing more important in this life than serving him and putting your faith in Him. You see the need there? We are weak. So where do we put our faith? Is it in ourselves? Our collective wisdom, in science, in medicine? No, all those things have limitations. We put our faith in God who is not limited. God who can care for us who has strength and power. We are weak but God is strong.

Jeremy Sweets  34:26
We also need to understand that we should use wisdom at a time like this. Take precautions. I think Luther had good advice. You know, take medicine, take precautions so that you can stop the spread of the disease that's actually loving and caring for other people if you can do what you can not to spread the sickness. So we need not ignore that advice. Take precautions where you can be smart about this. We need to also help those in need. Just because there is sickness around does not alleviate our responsibility toward others. Help others do what you can To help them, there was an email that went out, I'm on a group next door neighbor. And so you sign up with people in your neighborhood. And, and it gives you emails about things happening in your neighborhood. There was one, one person that emailed the entire group, everybody that was in that neighborhood and said, I'm a young, strong person, if you're older and can't get out, I'd love to go get medicine for you, or groceries or whatever I can. I thought that was a beautiful example of seeing what you could do to help even strangers. And so it may be if you're young, able bodied, not as susceptible, you you do those things you reach out, you seek to help where you can let us be people focused on helping others. And the greatest help that we can give others is ultimately to point them to Christ. So let us not forget, the church is the pillar in support of the truth. Yes, we can help in many ways when it comes to physical things. But ultimately, the most important thing is knowing Christ, knowing Christ. So let us point other people to Christ. Let us be those that see Jesus and point people to see Jesus to tie in our theme this year. Those are my comments this morning. Again, I hope they've been helpful. I hope that God has been glorified and what I've had to say. We're going to extend an invitation at this time as we are preparing to sing the invitation song. If you're here this morning, and you're not a Christian, there's no better time to become a Christian than right now. If you are a Christian, and you're not living as your should, there's no better time to make your life right than right now. There's a consistent theme right there. And that is act now. Don't delay and don't wait and whatever the case is to make your life right. There's anyone subject to the invitation, please come as we stand and sing at this time.
