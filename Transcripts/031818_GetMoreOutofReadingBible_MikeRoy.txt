is always such a blessing to not have the opportunity to come in to worship our God. That's what God created us to do. He made us in such a way that he gave us hearts and minds and mouths and ears. If he wants us to be attune to His Word, appreciate the prayer, John's pray that we would receive God's word. And ultimately, we want to be transformed by it. It's, it's a process. And the reality is, I'm a work in progress. You're a work in progress. We all are, but we're striving to become more and more like our God, our Savior, Jesus Christ. And so we have an opportunity to look at his word this evening, again, to be impacted by that ultimate change to be to really to possess more of the character, the holiness, the love, the compassion of our God, and of our Savior, Jesus Christ. I'm still thinking about the powerful texts that Conrad preached this morning, the phrase that sticks in my mind when Paul talks about their surpassing value of knowing Christ Jesus, my Lord, for whom I have suffered, the loss of all things, and consider them but rubbish. What a powerful text to contemplate. Thank you again, Conrad that that lesson. And we need to appreciate the value that God gives to us through Jesus Christ and the promises that He has given to us. We stress here at Broadmoor, the importance of daily reading God's word, and some capacity. And I'm encouraged to hear of so many of the members here who are engaged in some type of daily Bible reading, it is essential, it's really essential for your soul, for your faith, for your salvation, for clear thinking to overcome adversity, discouragement, and all those types of things.

Mike Roy  01:44
It's an encouraging thing to do, none of us do it perfectly. In fact, that for many years, I would try to read from Genesis to Revelation and do a kind of a checklist thing, and now have shifted with the high tech feature of my phone, one of the reading apps on my Bible, when reading plans on my Bible app, but the thing that we stress is to read some of God's word if you can, everyday now that gives, we don't do it perfectly, we get behind. But it's so important to do that. And it can make a difference in how we live our lives with more of a confident faith, and optimism and all that type of thing. Sometimes, though, in Bible reading, we may not seem to get a lot out of it. That's true of me, sometimes we get through the reading, I kind of check off that and not sure how much I gained from that. And so what I want to talk to you this evening, is about ways actually six ways to get more, I love reading your Bible. And this is not something that originally with me, but I want kind of adapted it to, for us and making some applications to how we can improve that in the process of reading God's word. So again, there are six things I want to talk about with you this evening. that I think can be very helpful as we seek to gain a better understanding of God's word to make it have more of an impression in our hearts and minds. And I want to go ahead and just begin with a preview. And then we'll talk about those things as we go through the lesson. So these are six things you can do and I can do to help us to get more out of our Bible Bible reading. Number one, meditate on God's word, memorize God's word, internalize God's word, cross reference the Word of God. Pray for some insight and understanding and then put you in the word in some of the things Alamy have talked about, remember. But anyway, we want to talk about these things this evening, in terms of some practical applications that we can put into practice in our lives as we seek to gain a better understanding of God's Word and let it have a greater impact on us. So the first thing I want to suggest to us if we want to get more out of our Bible reading, that we have to meditate on God's Word we talked about we all talk about this from time to time, and I think it's important to do so. But that that's probably maybe at the top of the list of things that we can do to to get more out of reading God's word. Look at this passage in Psalm chapter one is well known, we all we talked about it with some frequency. In Psalm chapter one and verse one. The writer says, Blessed is the man who walks not in the counsel of the wicked, nor stands in a way of sinners, nor sits in the seat of the scoffers, but his delight is in the law of the Lord and on his law. He meditates, he meditates and notice the phrase it follows that he meditates day and night. So this is not some type of legalism or legalistic attitude, but God wants us to be thinking about his word and In pondering that, so when we talk, we talk about meditating on God's word. Sometimes we're uncomfortable, maybe uncomfortable with that thought. But as as biblical teaching is anything that we do, God wants us in the process of reading His word, studying his word. He wants us to meditate on on it, that means to ponder it, to contemplate its meaning, to think about it, and to really to visualize the songs that are so powerful to me is because we visualize seeing Christ on his throne, we see God in His glory. And so, in Scripture, God tells us to, to meditate on His Word. So if you want to get more out of reading God's word, I think the first thing that we've got to do is spend time meditating on God's word. And so maybe one way to illustrate that is let's look at a few verses. That would give us recently to meditate on God's word. This one is in Matthew chapter three verses 1112. John the Baptist is preparing the way for Jesus coming. And this is what he said in verse 11. To his Jewish audience, I baptize you with water for repentance, but He who is coming after me is mightier than I who sandals I am not worthy to carry. He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire. Ultimately, he's talking about final judgment here. In verse 12, it says, His winnowing fork. So what is a winnowing fork? I haven't used one of those recently, but farmers use that to separate the wheat from the chaff and they throw the this up in the air and the chaff flows away and the wheat falls to the ground. So His winnowing fork is in His hand. This is Jesus doing that, and he will clear His threshing floor. He's talking about ultimately people, the good and bad and gather His wheat into the barn so he's going to gather his people into his home.

Mike Roy  06:59
but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire. You stop and think about that. This is Jesus speaking over here. That he is going to gather His wheat into the barn. but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire to have a better understanding of God's word we have to meditate on these verses. What does it mean when it says that he's going to burn the chaff with unquenchable fire? Well, another translation This is the Good News Translation may be a little bit loose in translation, verse 12, says he's going to get his wheat into the barn, but He will burn the chaff in a fire that never goes out.

Mike Roy  07:45
That's where the unquenchable fire is a fire that never ever, ever goes out. So what we're talking about the first point of the lesson this evening meditating, on God's word contemplating it, that's why God puts these words in here. I know that gets your attention. In some ways. It's shocking. We talked about this yesterday morning in our Baba classroom, the men study at Panera Bread. But God puts language in Scripture to get our attention to make us think about it, and often, ultimately, to motivate us to live a life of holiness and obedience in His presence. So and again, the point I'm making here that Jesus is the Most Merciful of loving the kindest individual who has ever lived. And John says about him on the day of judgment, that he's gonna separate the wheat from the chaff. He's gonna gather his people into the barn, but he's gonna burn the chaff in a fire that never goes out. So in Bible reading, we have to slow down too many times, I want to miss them too busy, or whatever is going on. I want to get through these two or three chapters, like, check, check the list, and I did that. But we have to slow down enough to read God's word and think about what it says. So that's what's involved in Bible meditating. Thinking about the word again, these are God's words. These are words inspired by the Holy Spirit. This is an accidental This is not accidental language. This is intentional language. And God wants us to think about what he has written. So this is one way that that illustrates the importance of meditating on God's word. Here's another one, from a positive standpoint, to the church at Laodicea, where Jesus was about to spit them out of his mouth. Remember, Revelation chapter three, and verse 20, says, Behold, I stand at the door and knocks the visual image there. If anyone hears My voice and opens the door, I will come in to him and eat with him. And he with me very often in the religious world, denominational preachers and pastors will use this as how a person comes to Christ and all they're going to do is knock at the door and Jesus will open to them and he will come in and dine with them. He's not talking about as we some time called the alien center, someone who's never obeyed the gospel. He's talking about a fallen Christians who are needed, who are in need of repentance. So he's telling these Christians, with the Church at Laodicea, who are really lukewarm and indifferent to God's word, he's Jesus said, I'm about ready to spit you out of my mouth. He said, I'm standing at the door, you said a few. Knock and hear my voice, I'm going to open up to you come in dine with you have fellowship with you, the one who conquers, and that's what God God is looking for individuals, Christians who will overcome this world, he said, our grant to him and look at the promise. Look at the promise that Jesus gives to every one of us. And he's given us to Christians who are on the verge of kind of losing their souls, the one who conquers all will grant him to sit with me, on My throne, as I also conquered and sat down with My Father on His throne. You stop a minute, think about that. And that's what Bible meditation will help us do. What is Jesus saying? Are we what does this mean? Can you imagine, over everything, we overcome the world that Jesus invites us to sit with Him on His Throne in Heaven, to share his honor to share His glory, to share his praise, to share his power, to share His holiness. human being can't do that, except through the blood of Christ, except through obedience to the will of God. So, so God gives us this breathtaking promise of eternal glory. For anyone who is willing to overcome this world. That's the condition over here. So in Bible meditation, what I'm suggesting is we have to, in some way, slow down and look at what God is saying, and think about it, and let it let it resonate in our hearts as we seek to become more like Him. So the first thing that we need to do, I think that's so helpful, and getting more out of our Bible reading, is to meditate on God's word. Secondly, I want to suggest to you another way to increase the benefit of our Bible reading is to memorize God's word Jeremy has talked about this through the years off and on, it's a, it's a valuable thing. We need to really commit God's word to memory, use your your, your, your iPhones to do that your smartphones, your your laptop, or whatever it might be, but memorizing God's word is really, it's an exercise, it's ultimately in your best interest. And so God tells us the importance of, of having his word committed to our memory. Look at Deuteronomy, chapter six, verses four through nine.

Mike Roy  12:48
Again, a well known passage of scripture where Moses has reminded the people the importance of following God faithfully. So in verse four, he says, Here, O Israel, the LORD our God, the Lord is One, you shall love the Lord your God, with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind, and these words that I command you today shall be on your heart. So God wants His word, not just in our ears, but in our hearts in our minds. So that's the first thing that comes to my mind when I look at this. And I think ultimately, God is saying he wants us to actually commit his word to memory. Jesus did that right? When he was tempted, on so many occasions, and the devil came to Him, Jesus would say, It is written, You shall not put the Lord your God to the test, it is written, Man shall not live by bread and bread alone. These phrases should be in our hearts in our minds. And so God's telling Israel through Moses in the Old Testament, as he's giving him the law, and even repeating it, these words that I command, you shall be on your heart, or in your heart. In verse seven, he said, You shall teach them diligently to your children. And, and, and want to say appreciate, we're thankful to have so many godly young families here who are teaching your children God's word, don't want to run past that. Sometimes some, we think we may fall short. We're not the perfect parent, and nobody is. But we have some godly family, a lot of godly families here, who are doing that very thing. So again, the message of our seven you shall teach them diligently to your children, you shall talk to them when you sit in your house. And when you walk, by the way, and when you lie down. And when you rise up at every turn. We're trying to help our children commit God's word to their memory. And again, I appreciate that the spiritual mindset of so many young families here at Broadmoor, then in verse eight, he goes on to say, in the process of getting God's Word into our hearts and minds, so you shall bind them as a sign on your hand. If any of y'all in school Write on your your hand. Yeah, I did that some not not enough, probably. But But yeah, so rut bind God's word as a sign on your hands, keep it so close to you, that you connect it with your mind. So God's telling these people through Moses or buying them as a sign on your hand, there shall be as frontlets between your eyes again, as close as my glasses, that God's word is that close. We do different things. I keep myself notice, I still have some note cards that remind me of my purpose and preaching is to save a soul from eternal destruction. Sometimes I just have scripture and I read it. And I'm trying to impress that into my mind. So God tells his people that his words shall be as frontlets between your eyes, And these shall write them on the doorposts of your house. I'm thankful if you go around member's homes in his congregation, you'll find scriptures on people's walls, maybe ceilings or door jamb. That's a wonderful thing. Right God's Word we get on some pillows in the house or plaques, God's word written there. So write them on the doorposts of your house. and on your gates, is God trying to say something to us about the importance of having God's Word in our hearts, he actually wants us to commit that to our memories so that when we are tempted with lust, or anger, or pride or discouragement or even despair, we don't give up. We don't throw the towel in. Because God's word is so near to our hearts and minds, that we have lived it and make an impact on so the second point I want us to, to recognize then, as a second thing that we can do to improve our reading of the Bible is memorize God's word, it's in your best interest in my best interest to memorize God's word. The third thing is this, so many things can be overlapped. The third thing that I want to suggest that we can do to improve our Bible reading is to internalize God's word, and then not just to read it superficially, but to make it a part of us. So look at how much how often this is mentioned in Scripture. We're going to look at a few scriptures this evening. In Psalm chapter 119, in verse nine and verse nine, the right says, How can a young person stay on the path of purity? We struggle with purity? I do.

Mike Roy  17:36
You do, right? We're human beings. We're bombarded with sexual enticements. At every turn of the page was a computer. How can a young person stay on the path of purity? By living according to your word? I seek you with all my heart. Do not let me stray from your commands in verse 11. I have hidden your word in my heart. That's that's the gold and Bible reading Bible teaching, to hide God's Word in your heart in my for each one of us to do that. And just looking at this text, what's the benefit of hiding God's Word in our hearts, according to verse 11. He said that I might not sin against you, if we want to overcome the battle with sin.

Mike Roy  18:25
It begins by by hiding, hiding God's word, internalizing His Word. And that's what really what God is looking for. He wants His Word in our hearts, in our minds. He wants us to be changed by that by his word. And we do that by internalizing it. And we realize it's a struggle that we're busy with something we're tired, we can be anxious about life and worried and all the things that go on. But But putting God's Word into the deepest recesses of our hearts and minds will keep us from sin will keep us from discouragement. Another passage that comes to mind with James chapter one, and verses 19 through 21, that stresses the importance of internalizing God's word James says this, know this, my beloved brothers, let every person be quick to hear slow to speak, slow to anger, for the anger of man does not produce the righteousness of God, therefore said put aside or put away all filthiness and rapid wickedness, and receive with meekness, the implanted word. So what God wants us to do with his words, we read it as we're involved in public reading of God's word, preaching God's word, or our hopefully daily Bible reading program. So plants that we may be on. We need to plant God, we're just like you would take a flower in the soil out there, and you get that soil ready, you get your heart ready, you get the water, you get the sunlight, the fertilizer, you put that plant in the soil, and then it grows into a healthy plant. So God wants us to plant his word into our hearts is not enough to just hear God's word. We have to obviously respond to that. And so the the injunction in Scripture is for us to internalize God's word, James use of the phrase to receive the word implanted. So God, really God dwells in us, really on the basis of his word, and we're changed by his word is His Word gets into the deepest recesses of our hearts. And how successful will the devil be against us with all the temptations? With all the trials that we may experience in life? I know that sometimes it may, we may face a daunting task and overcome trial, difficulty, temptation we all do. But what's the benefit? What is the benefit according to this verse? And sometimes I think, just let the Bible be his own best, expository, what's the benefit of implanting God's Word into your heart, mind and soul according to this verse, which is able to save your soul. That's what God's Word does, doesn't need fancy preaching, or teachers are we going to do is get the word out and get it into our hearts. If we receive God's word and plant it into our hearts, I'm gonna go to heaven when I die, I can save my soul and not be discouraged, and not give up or not give into temptation or trial or discouragement. And so this is a process of how we can increase the value of reading our Bibles, not just going through the process kind of quickly, like I so often do in my life, but to take that word and to press it into my heart, and to be ultimately changed by it. So that's the third point I want to suggest that we can do to improve our Bible reading, make our reading of the Bible more helpful, we internalize God's word. The fourth thing I want to suggest to us this evening is we want to find ways of improving the reading of God's word, want to cross referenced the word. So here's just an example that will illustrate this. We do this I think on a regular basis, sometimes in classes, we read something, then we go through another verse to maybe reinforce that. So John chapter three, and verse three, Jesus is talking about the reverse saying that you're going to be born again, if you want to go to heaven. And just as an aside, if you haven't been born again, you can't go to heaven. That's what Jesus is saying. Here. Jesus is talking to Nicodemus, Nicodemus thought he was a really good person. He was a, I believe, a member of the Sanhedrin, a teacher of God's law. And he thought that he was on the right path. Jesus answered me said Truly I say to you, unless one is born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God. Look at that word cannot. If a person is unwilling to be born again, that person cannot go to heaven.

Mike Roy  23:04
That Scripture gets our attention, doesn't it? So what does it mean to be born again? That's when Nicodemus a kind of a an intro was mother's womb a second time when he is old, like me, hadn't be born again. I'm not that old. But you know what I'm saying? Can a man be born again when he's old? And verse five, Jesus answered, he's explaining what the rebirth is all about. Jesus answered, Truly I say to you, unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God. So obviously, everybody has been born one time we, we've all come into the world that way. He's talking about the second birth over here. What's involved in the second birth is you got to be born of water and the Spirit. Say, Well, what's he talking? Is that a reference to baptism? Maybe you have some question about that. You look at Titus chapter three, by way of cross referencing God's word. And Paul's writing to Titus, he said this, that God saved this not because of works done by us in righteousness, but according to his own mercy. Remember that no matter no matter what we've done, God is God's mercy is the basis of our salvation. So not works are done in righteousness, but according to his own mercy, by the washing of regeneration, Oh, you look at this statement over here, and maybe to help us understand better what John chapter three is saying. So he said he could be born of water. Over here, he's saying that, by the washing of regeneration, they think is clearly talking about water baptism, not alone. He said also by the renewal of the Holy Spirit, so one of the must be boiling of water, and the spirit. And over here he's talking about that we've been reborn, regenerated through the washing. Bye, bye. The washing of regeneration is a renewal of the Holy Spirit whom He poured out on us recently through Jesus Christ our Savior. So I'm gonna Other way of helping us to get more out of our Bible reading is doing that new scripture and I'm even sermon preparation. I've got a New American Standard Version. I've had for a long time need to probably update that. But there's a lot of scriptures in my center column references that have so helpful. And so when you look at these verses, for example, Titus chapter three kind of complements what John said, or Jesus said in John chapter three, verses three through five, and again, maybe by way of making it way, I'm not sure I'm trying to say, trying to memorize these verses. So John, chapter three, verses three and five, says almost the same thing that time is chapter three and verse five says, thing, the same thing. So Jesus is talking about the rebirth which involves water and the Spirit Titus says, the same thing that we are washed through this regeneration is also brought about through the Holy Spirit who gives us God's word. So again, one way that we can increase our our knowledge of the Bible and really have better

Mike Roy  26:10
a Bible reading process is to spend some time in cross referencing God's Word. Now the thing I think this one of things that Allah may have talked about, one thing that we can do, to improve our Bible reading is to pray for a better and fuller understanding of God's word those what Paul says in Ephesians chapter one, he's thinking about God's eternal plan of salvation. He said, For this reason, because I have heard of your faith in the Lord Jesus, in your love toward all the saints, I do not cease to give thanks for you remembering you in my prayers. What did what was Paul's prayer for these Christians in verse 16, then in verse 17, that the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give you the spirit of wisdom, and and of revelation in the knowledge of him. We were talking this morning about Paul's desire is to know Christ Jesus. And how much do we know our God? How much do we knew know our Savior, Jesus Christ. And so that's Paul's prayer that we would come to a better understanding of, of His will, having the eyes of your heart enlightened, that you may know what is the hope to which he has called you? What are the riches of His glorious inheritance in the saints? And what is the immeasurable greatness of His power toward us, who believe according to the working of his mind, when we meditate on God's word to look at all these phrases, the riches of His glorious inheritance in the saints, the saints that we as God's children, are Jesus's inheritance. And then in verse 19, he wants us to know the immeasurable greatness of His power. Do you feel like you need power and strength to overcome your trials and temptations? We all do. And so prayer is a tool that can help us as we study God's Word, also Ephesians chapter three. Paul, again, is praying for these Christians. And again, thinking about God's magnificent plan of redemption. In verse 14, he said, For this reason, I bow my knees before the Father from whom every family in heaven on earth is named, that according to the riches of his glory, he may grant you to be strengthened with power through his Spirit in the, in your inner being. so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith, and that you being rooted and grounded in love may have the strength look at this phrase over here. This what is Paul praying for these Christians at Ephesus, that they would have the strength to comprehend with all the same saints? What is the breadth, and the length, in the height and the depth and to know the love of Christ that surpasses knowledge, that you may be filled with all the fullness of God? So in his prayer for these Christians, he wanted them to understand how high and how wide and how deep and how long God's love is, can you measure it? No, it can't be measured. But when you think about it, when you contemplate how much God loves you, it changes you. Maybe you feel unworthy in some ways, and I'm not worthy of such love, who is not at all. But this first tells us to meditate on the magnitude of a depth of God's love. It is it is breathtaking in scope. It's unimaginable in so many ways. We don't live at that level. So in to help our help us in our Bible reading to improve our Bible reading. Before you open up the Bible before you take out your app, pray about it. Lord, open the eyes of my heart. We sing that song, open my heart so I can see wondrous things out of your law. Then when you may be finished. Thank God for the opportunity to read His word. One other point that I want to mention before we wrap up the lesson this evening. And that is as we look at God's Word. We want to make it personal and bonded I want to say, put yourself put you in God's Word, we read these great promises that God has given to us. And John chapter three and verse 16. For God so loved the world that He gave His only Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have eternal life. For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world, but an order that the world might be saved through him. But when it says that, Jesus said that God so loved the world, that means that He loved us. And I've just put a few names in here. So God so loved Anna, we've got a couple Anna's in our congregation, God so loved Anna, God, so loves to get a bunch of Kevin's right. God so loved Kevin, that he gave his only Son did a Kevin would be leaving him, he would be saved from his sins for all eternity. So as we go through God's word, put your name in there.

Mike Roy  30:56
That's something you can do in your Bible ready, put your name in there, because God already has it in there. So these are some things hopefully that will be helpful for each one of us, as we want to improve in our Bible reading. So these are the six ways to get more out of reading your Bible. Number one, meditate on God's word. Memorize God's word, internalize God's word, cross reference the Word of God, pray for insight and understanding, and then put you in the Word. So hopefully these will be helpful for each one of us. I'm encouraged to see so many in some type of a regular Bible reading program, it is so helpful. And so to make Bible reading more meaningful and more effective for each one of us, it requires some effort, it requires some diligence. And so as we extend the invitation this evening, I'll remind you what we read just a few minutes minutes ago from James chapter one, that we are to receive God's word, implanted the implanted word, it is able to save our souls. If you want to go to heaven, you have to know God's word you have to respond to God's word God's plan of salvation is plain. It's not difficult to, to comprehend. And to become a Christian means that we must believe that Jesus is the Messiah, we must be willing to repent of our sins, we must confess our faith in him before man, we must submit to God's command of baptism in order to have our sins forgiven. That's pointless, really describing in some ways the born again process. If you have if you're here this evening, you haven't done that. We urge you to do that before it is too late. And maybe that you just need the prayers of the congregation as you seek to become all that God wants you to be if you hear this evening, need to respond in any way we invite you to come down to the front while we stand and sing this invitation song
