viens Chapter Three Philippians chapter three, we're going to start by reading verses one through 11.

Conrad Harkrider  00:19
Philippians chapter three, beginning in verse one. Paul writes, finally my brethren, Rejoice in the Lord. For me to write the same things to you is not tedious. But for you it is safe. Beware of dogs, beware of evil workers, beware of mutilation. For we are the circumcision, who worship God in the Spirit. rejoice in Christ Jesus and have no confidence in the flesh. Though I also might have confidence in the flesh. If anyone else thinks he may have confidence in the flesh, I'm more so Circumcised the eighth day, of the stock of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews, concerning the law, a Pharisee, Concerning zeal, persecuting the church, concerning the righteousness which is in the law, blameless. But what things were gain to me these I have counted loss for Christ. Yet indeed, I count all things loss for the excellence of the knowledge of Christ Jesus, my Lord, for whom I have suffered the loss of all things and count them as rubbish, that I may gain Christ, and being found in him not having my own righteousness, which is from the law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness which is from God by faith, that I may know him and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death, if by any means I may attain to the resurrection from the dead. A while back, we were talking with a friend about a well known musician that lives here in Nashville. And as we were discussing this, she made the comment she said, I know him, almost casually said that I know him. We said, What do you mean, you know him? Like, you know, his songs, or you've been to some of his concerts? She said, No, I've actually been to his house. We said, Were you stalking him? Or did he know you were on the grounds? She said, No, I've I've gone and gotten coffee with his wife a couple of times. And at this point, my mind is just amazed because a few minutes ago, we were talking about songs that we like, and now she's saying that she's had coffee with his wife. So now we're asking questions like, Well, have you gotten an autograph? Have you taken a picture with him? Has he played any private sessions? She said, No, he doesn't really like to do that. He's, he's kind of humble, shy.

Conrad Harkrider  03:15
And this was incredible. Apparently, we were amazed to find out that she knows this talented and apparently humble musician. In Philippians, chapter three, Paul talks about his desire and his pursuit in knowing Christ. In verse eight, he talks about his the knowledge, the excellent knowledge of Christ. In verse 10, he says that he wants to know him and the power of his resurrection. More than anything else, Paul wanted to know, Christ. He wanted to be found in him. He wanted to be like him. He wanted to glory and boast and trust in Christ instead of his own accomplishments. What does it mean when we say that we know someone? What does it mean to know Christ to have a relationship with Him? Some of the things that Paul says in Philippians chapter three, might actually surprise us about that. And so I want to take a look at this section this morning and dig a little deeper as we think about our connection to Jesus Christ. Look what he says, first of all, in verse one about knowing Christ, He says, Finally, my brethren, Rejoice in the Lord. For me to write the same things to you is not tedious. But for you it is safe. knowing Christ means that we rejoice in the Lord. Rejoicing is a theme that is found throughout the book of Philippians that were word joy or rejoice is found 14 times in these four chapters. And these are things that and notice that the type of rejoicing that Paul commands here is in the Lord. Rejoice in the Lord. Not just rejoice in how well life is going, or the new house or the new job, or my good health or the blessings, the physical blessings, but the source and the ultimate foundation of our joy is in the Lord. That's the the true blessing that can never be taken away can never be altered or tampered with. He tells them that this is no trouble for him to remind them of these things, that it's not tedious or burdensome, some for him to say it again. Children often need reminding of certain things again, and again. Don't run in the house, take your shoes off, chew with your mouth closed. You know, we have to repeat these things to try to get the lessons to stick. But as God's children we need a constant reminder to live with joy. Being a Christian is not a life that is to be walked like a we're carrying some heavy burden. Like we're living under some oppressive set of rules. But Paul says to live with joy, it is a safeguard. It's a protection. It keeps us from bitterness. When we rejoice, it keeps us from despair. Paul and Silas were locked up in a Philippians jail and instead of looking around at their situation and feeling hopeless. Acts chapter 16 says that they were singing praises to God in the middle of the night. So rejoice in the Lord. That is a key sign or attribute of our relationship of knowing Christ. Also, look at verse two. Paul says beware of dogs, beware of evil workers. Beware of mutilation. Paul transitions into a very strong warning. And he tells them to watch out to be on alert for these evil workers. He calls them dogs and mutilate errs of the flesh. calling someone a dog is not a compliment. These are wild animals. They are running around, they're biting. They're devouring their snarling. Jews often referred to Gentiles as dogs. It was a way to degrade them and belittle them. So what were these people doing that would cause Paul to refer to them with these strong terms.

Conrad Harkrider  08:11
During the early church, there was a group of Jewish teachers that were telling new Christians that in order to be saved, in order to be accepted by God, you had to be circumcised that Christ wasn't all that there was to a relationship with God. But there was more that had to be done. And from their perspective, Jews had been circumcised for 1000s of years, it was a sign of the covenant that they had with Abraham. It was what connected them back to the promise that God had made with him. And so it only made sense that these new converts would adopt this same practice. This was brought up in Acts chapter 15, when the Paul and others came to meet with the council in Jerusalem. Also in Galatians, chapter two, Paul addresses this, about how the Gentiles were being urged to keep the Law of Moses. But the problem was, it wasn't right. What they were teaching wasn't true. And when these people went around saying something that was false, Paul doesn't just say, well, they have a different opinion on that. You know, they're seeing that a little differently than I see it. When he identifies that they have said something that is contrary to God's truth, he calls it evil. He says they are dogs, they're not circumcising, they are mutilating the flesh. And so it's a strong warning and a caution that if someone is compelling another to do something that is contrary to the Word of God it's it's evil. Look at what Paul says in verse three. In contrast to these false teachers in verse three, he says, For we are the circumcision, who worship God and the Spirit, rejoice in Christ Jesus and have no confidence in the flesh. Those who know Christ, those who are connected to Christ put no confidence in the flesh, verse three, we don't put our hope in things that are physical. He says, instead, we worship God. In the spirit, we boast or glory in Christ. Paul, as he often does, in the book of Philippians, he uses himself as an example he sets himself up as a model for how they should think for how they should act. And so now he's going to show them or explain to them how he could have confidence in the flesh. First of all, he notes his heritage. Look at verse four. He says, No, I also might have confidence in the flesh. If anyone else thinks he may have confidence in the flesh, I'm moreso, Circumcised the eighth day of the sock of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews, if anyone had the right to have confidence in where they came from, in their background and their lineage and their family, it was Paul, he says circumcised on the eighth day, that means he was born a Jew, he didn't become a child of a part of Israel later on in life, but from the very beginning, he was in this special part, this special nation of God's people. He was from the tribe of Benjamin. That means he knew his his lineage, he could trace it back to one of the original 12 sons of Jacob. Benjamin was also one of the tribes that one of the the only tribe that remained faithful and committed to the house of David, they were protectors of God's temple. He says that he was a Hebrew of Hebrews. Both of his parents were Jews. There was no mixed blood or mixed race he was he had pure lineage. He also notes his diligence in keeping the law. In the second half of verse five, he mentions that concerning the law, he was a Pharisee, Concerning zeal, a persecutor of the church, verse six, concerning the righteousness which is in the law, blameless. When it came to observing the requirements of the law, Paul followed the strictest sect of the Jews, the Pharisees. You remember in Matthew chapter 23, Jesus references, how the Pharisees were the ones who were tithing the herbs in their garden.

Conrad Harkrider  13:01
They went down, they meticulously sought to keep every component or aspect of the of the law. He also speaks about his zeal when it came to devotion, and eagerness and commitment. Paul says he was a persecutor of the church, when this new doctrine or way arose that threatened Judaism, Paul sought to stamp it out. He put people in prison, and not just to put them in the county jail for a couple of nights. But he insisted that they be put to death. When it came to righteousness and keeping the rules and ordinances of the law, what to eat, what to wear, what to sacrifice. Paul says that in these things, he was blameless. And you look at that, and you think what a resume. That's incredible. If we were to compare that maybe to a, an example, today, think about if your daughter went off to college, and she comes back from school, and she's dating a guy, and she thinks he might be the one, you start to ask about him to learn more about this new man in her life. And she says that, well, he's from Detroit and his family runs a car business up there. His last name is Ford. Okay, I think I've heard of them. He said, Well, where did he go to school? She says, Well, he got his degree in engineering from a school out east. It's called MIT. All right. I think I know about that. Okay, well, what does he like to do in his his spare time? Well, he, he's great at building furniture. He also likes poetry and writing songs. And he's great with kids. All right, bring him home, let us meet him. From a worldly standpoint, he's got everything that you would want. Paul has all of the credentials, he has the right background, he has the right training. He's well respected by all of the Jewish leaders by the most important people in the nation. He's got everything that you would want. And look at what he says in verse seven. But what things were gain to me these I have counted loss for Christ. The things that I valued, the things that were important, the things that I put a lot of emphasis on. Paul says, when I came to Christ, I put them aside, they meant nothing to me, I counted them as loss, knowing Christ was so much greater. And in fact, these things, these Jewish requirements, these credentials that Paul had, they often got in the way of people coming to Christ, they were a hindrance or a roadblock, from people serving Him. So what about us? In what ways do we put confidence in the flesh? If those who know Christ put no confidence in the flesh, where in our life, are we placing confidence? And it's preventing us from our relation to having a relationship with God, maybe it is in our heritage. My parents are both Christians, my grandparents. So they started this church. My family has been members here for three generations. My dad, he served as a deacon for 40 years, I can sing all of the songs. I know, every single one, I can sing them with my eyes closed. Paul would say, oh, yeah, so what? So what does that mean? What are you doing with it just because mom and dad had great faith doesn't mean that my love for God is strong and growing, and genuine. And the point is, when we put emphasis in the wrong place, on the things that we can see, it provides us with a false sense of security, we start to pay attention to appearance, more than we do to things of substance. And on paper, it sounds really good, it looks really good. But behind that, we may find a person who is weak and shallow and passionless in their service to God

Conrad Harkrider  17:57
has our keeping of the law or our own righteous deeds become something that we boast in? Is that where I find my security, my hope, my assurance that I know that I am in a relationship with God, because of the things that I've done, how well I'm following the rules. I go to church on Sundays, I read my Bible. You know, I haven't murdered anyone, I don't steal things from the store. I'm not on drugs. I'm a pretty nice person. I try to help people when I can. And I look at my actions. And I think hopefully in the end, then God will see these things and he will, he will save me. After all, I tried to come to the gospel meeting every night or as many nights as I could. And we start to find assurance in the things that we have done. I think Paul would say that's confidence in the flesh. When it comes to our salvation, do we truly believe that in Christ alone, my hope is found? And not because of how I observe or keep the law. Keeping the law cannot save you from your sins. An officer pulls you over and he says I'm going to write you a ticket for running that red light. And you say I've never run that let red light before, sir. He says well, you ran it today. You say but I've been through that intersection 1000 times and I always stop If you can look at my driving record, it's clean. He says, today you ran the red light. You broke the law and I'm writing you a ticket. The only way that we can be saved by our actions by keeping the things in the law is if we do it perfectly. The law has no ability to forgive or release us from our sin, it can only convict us. In Romans chapter three and verse 20, Paul says, For by works of the law, no human being will be justified in his sights and through the law comes knowledge of sin. The law makes us aware, it makes us cognizant of what's right and what's wrong. The law says don't drink that it could harm you. It could poison you can make you sick. We have that knowledge. But what happens once I drink it? What happens once it's in my system, knowing that it's bad for me doesn't help. We need something more. I think we all understand that salvation is a gift, that salvation that coming to Christ is something that he gives to us. We don't deserve his forgiveness. When he saved me from my sins, I didn't earn that. When he changed me to become a new person. When I came out of my former life, I didn't somehow deserve those things. But then all of a sudden, once we become a Christian, we somehow changed from it's a gift of God to now it's a point system, where we have to constantly earn his favor and be doing things so that we are approved by him. His forgiveness is a gift. But don't forget that his daily presence in our lives is also a gift. Not something that has to be earned again, and again. Look at what he says in verse nine. And be found in him not having my own righteousness, which is from the law. But that which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness which is from God, by faith. The things that we do are important. How we act, how we think how we talk. After all, we are trying to be like Christ, he's the model. He is the goal of what we are pursuing.

Conrad Harkrider  22:55
But ultimately, it comes down to where do we find our sufficiency? Where do we rest our hope, and our trust? When we think about reaching the end of our life? What is it when we stand before God that we're going to be holding on to and trusting in and relying on? Is it the fact that I have prayed enough? Is it the fact that I have done enough good deeds? Isn't? Isn't the fact that I have served enough people remember, the standard is Jesus. I don't know if I want to rely on my track record when I am being compared to Christ? Or do we put our confidence and our trust in the Lord? I think the difference is the attention is not so much on me and what I do and my performance, but rather on what he's done. And then our service to him become something not out of obligation where we're trying to keep a list of rules, but rather out of gratefulness, and gratitude. We serve Him because of what he's done. In First Peter chapter one and verse 13. It says, Therefore, prepare your minds for action, keep sober and spirit fix your hope, completely on the grace to be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ. The thing that you hope in entirely completely is the grace that is to be brought to you through Jesus Christ. No confidence in the flesh. Also, notice what he says in verse eight. Yes, indeed, I also count all things loss for the excellence of the knowledge of Christ my Lord, for whom I have suffered the loss of all things. Beans and count them as rubbish, that I may gain Christ. knowing Christ means that we count everything as loss. We count it as loss. Well Paul had in his former life, what he had as a Jew, he gave up when he came to Christ, his position, the recognition, many of the relationships that he had the prestige and the honor that he wants possessed, he trades it all in for Christ. In verse eight, he says that he's he talks about the surpassing worth, the excellence, the infinite value of knowing Christ. Jesus told a parable about a man who went and found a treasure in a field. And after realizing its value, and its worth says, Jesus says that He went and sold all of his possessions so that he could buy that one field and obtain that treasure. I think that's where Paul is at here. He's willing to give up everything else. And not only does he traded in verse eight, but he says that he regards it as rubbish. The things that were once important to him his heritage, his standing in the Jewish community, in comparison to Christ, those things, were now regarded as one big giant pile of garbage. firsthand, knowing Christ was so much greater to know the power of his resurrection, to have the hope of one day being raised from the dead, to share with Christ in his sufferings to become like him. What things have you counted as loss? For Christ? What thing in your life was really important to you? And then after you came to know, Christ, it lost its appeal. I think about relationships, groups of people that I was really concerned with impressing, I cared about their opinions, I wanted their approval, I wanted their acceptance. And then after coming to know Christ, it's not as important. It doesn't make a difference, what they think.

Conrad Harkrider  27:49
What about your connection to certain things. You know all about the latest trends, you've seen all the latest movies, you're in on whatever's happening in Hollywood, you are a person in the know. And you liked learning about all those things. But after Christ, your priorities change your direction, your mindset, your attitude towards those things, is now different. You count them as loss. And Paul says the things that he cared about and loved most he saw them as rubbish. Do we see our connection to Christ as more valuable and more significant than anything else in this world? That we would be willing to give up the things that once impressed us that enamored us that delighted us? Do we see Christ as more precious as more valuable? count everything as loss. And we do that because Christ is worth far more. Christ is worth more than the good, a great job, he's worth more than a nice house, then lots of money than the approval of friends than the recognition we might get in this world. He's worth more than a wife and children or any other thing in this life that we might assign value to Christ is more.

Conrad Harkrider  29:26
If you were diagnosed with some form of terminal cancer, there was no cure. And then you found out that they were doing a clinical trial. And after the first few rounds, they they discovered that this particular medicine had 100% success rate. But it was only being offered in another part of the world in Australia. But 100% It could completely cure you of this These would you go? Would you travel halfway around the world for something that could save your life? Would you spend 1000s of dollars on that treatment? Would you spend time away from your job from your family, from your friends from your hobbies? If people ask you, well, why are you going on this trip? It'd be a pretty straightforward explanation. This is my life until we're talking about, I have to have this. It's essential. Whatever I have to miss out on or put to the side, people are going to understand because life is precious. So how much more are we willing to give up for what Jesus offers? Jesus has said before us, the cure to the greatest disease that has ever affected mankind, the disease of sin. We can be saved from our sins, but are we willing to set these things aside to count them as loss for the surpassing worth of knowing Christ? In Luke chapter 18, and verse 28, Peter said, See, we have left our homes and followed you. And He said to them, Truly I say to you, there is no one who has left house or wife or brothers or parents or children, for the sake of the kingdom of God, who will not receive many times more in this time, and in the age to come, eternal life. Peter points out we have left all we have left our houses. And Jesus reminds him that what you gain in return is far better. It's worth so much more houses and brothers and sisters in this life and in the life to come. Eternal life. Have you accepted that great blessing from the Lord? We're going to close with an invitation song. It's an opportunity for those who need to come into a relationship with Jesus Christ to take that step two, begin that walk so that you can have a connection to the Son of God so that you can be in a relationship with Him. If there's something that we can do to help or encourage you, in your walk, please come down to the front as we stand and see
