It's always a great privilege and honor to speak God's word to have an opportunity to communicate, communicate his will to each of us. We remind ourselves that we live by God's power by His grace by his strength. And though we have a little different situation that we're facing in our country today, biblical truth remains the same as I contemplated. What to what message to bring this morning. Psalm 46 is the song that came to mind and perhaps it came to your mind as well. And do some research I've found out that this was a favorite song of Martin Luther. He was a well known German theologian who started the Reformation movement. And as he protested the abuses in the Catholic Church, he faced many dark days in his life, including intimidation and death threats. It was very serious time. But Psalm 46 means a lot to all of us, I think, because it conveys such calmness and confidence and a world of upheaval. So as we deal with uncertainty and a lot of anxiety, perhaps because of sickness, and the Coronavirus, that type of thing in our world. This psalm gives us a perspective, by pointing us to an unchanging God, who still rules His creation. I appreciate the songs that norm sent to the group this morning, a couple of those in particular go very well with this lesson, a shield about me, and hide me away. Oh, Lord gets reminded that God is our strength, he is our refuge. And so this morning, we will be looking at Psalm 46. And I've titled The lesson right off from the first verse, that God is our refuge and strength. And again, these principles are so powerful that we have to kind of contemplate its meaning to think about what God is really saying to us in Psalm 46. But what I'm going to do this morning is basically look at three sections, break the psalm down to three sections, verses one, two, and three, verses four through seven, and then verses eight through 11. So it kind of break it down into three sections. But I'm really gonna bring out about five fundamental lessons that I want us to glean from this psalm, well known Psalm, very famous, and again, something that's maybe treasured by by most of us. But in this song, God's communicating a truth to us, that we have to keep before us, is we navigate sometimes in an uncertain world. And so again, I want to share five lessons that I have put together from the psalm, there's probably more that you can get from the song. But I'm going to focus on five this morning. And we're going to look at the first three verses here in just a moment. I've got these scriptures up on the screen as well. But the first point I want us to contemplate as we think about Psalm 46, is to understand that God is bigger and stronger than the greatest upheaval in our world. And we have no reason to live in fear. So this is kind of like a foundational truth that this psalm is saying to each one of us, that God really is bigger and stronger than anything that happens in this world. And because of that, there is no reason for us as Christians to be afraid that's really what he's telling us over here. So look at this text with me on the screen. This is the NIV says God is our refuge and strength in ever present help in trouble. Therefore,

Mike Roy  03:33
we will not fear though the earth give away in the mountains fall into the heart of the sea, though its waters roar and foam in the mountains quake with their surging. So I want to suggest to you that the kind of catastrophic language in verses two and three, serve to confirm the truth of verse one, that God is our refuge, and he is our strength, but a couple of words we get to think about for just a moment. As we get into this text this morning. The first word is refuge, God is our refuge. What does that mean? But it's not a word that we use a lot, I believe is Albert Barnes points out in his commentary, this is a compound word, meaning to run, this refuge run and run to. So it's this idea of not just maybe running away from pain or difficulty, but the idea of running to God himself as a place of safety and security. He is our hiding place. He is our place of confidence, and solitude and assurance. So when the psalmist says that God is our refuge, again, the word means to run, run to basically run to God. And so he gives us that that assurance this reminds me of some verses that a song that we sing Rock of Ages, cleft for me, let me hide myself. Often these Oh, God is our refuge we hide ourselves in God. This song was written by I believe, August, top lady, and a middle 1800s. In England, I was told that this man was navigating a gorge in terrible driving rainstorm, and to find a place of safety he located a craggy cliff, a cleft in the rock. And he thrust himself into the cleft of that rock to protect himself from all the torrent in the rain and destruction all around him. And I'm told that in that moment, was born the inspiration for this song Rock of Ages, cleft for me, let me hide myself and be it's reminded that we're not dealing with the hiding ourselves because of storms that although that can happen, but because maybe persecution and difficulties and oppression, that God is our sense of strength. So when it says God is our refuge, that means we can we can run to him. So literally, that's what we ought to do, we have to run to God as a source of refuge. The writer proverb says, you have to 18 Verse 10, that the name of the Lord is a strong tower, the righteous run into it, and is safe. So we see God, we need to see God is a strong tower. And we were in times of distress, and uncertainty, or famine, or opposition, or whatever it may be, that we can we look at the Lord as a strong tower, and we run into that tower for protection for safety for refuge. Again, it's a very vivid image over here. The second word that I want us to see in verse one is that God is not only a refuge, but he is our strength. And so it's just a reminder to us that, that God is the source of our strength, our strength does not come from ourselves, from our intelligence, from our skill, from our physical abilities, from our, even our great spiritual wisdom that we may have accumulated through the years. God is the source of our strength, and that he himself is our strength. That's the point that is making, that that His strength is our strength. And the reason we can overcome difficulty in trial in sickness and suffering and famine, and adversity and financial setback is because God is our strength, his strength is my strength. He gives me strength to teach his word to preach His Word, He gives us strength to live and face our difficulties. And so even though we may be understand this principle, we have to remind ourselves, brethren, that our strength comes from God. And and the truth is that he is always present to help us and ever present help in trouble as the NIV says over here. And so because of that, again, you look in verse two, because God is our refuge and strength. The writer says, The psalmist says, Therefore we will not fear there's no reason to be afraid, because God is our strength, and he is our refuge. So again, look at this, these first few verses with me probably spending more time on these verses in some of the others. So the psalmist reminds us that God is our refuge, he's our strength, because he's an ever present help in trouble. He's like that strong tower. There's nothing to be afraid of. Do you struggle with fear? Do you struggle with

Mike Roy  08:33
anxiety I certainly do at times, but if God is our refuge, if he is our strength, there is nothing for, for Christians to be afraid of, because he's bigger and stronger than what we face in this world. Now notice in verses two and three, this again kind of catastrophic language illustrates the power of the first verse and the truthfulness of the first verse. When it says, though the earth giveway in the mountains fall into the heart of the sea, though its waters roar and foam, and the mountains quake with theirs, their surge and so there's a contrast over here. So he said, though the earth gives way, in the mountains fall into the heart of the sea. The question is, when was the last time you saw a mountain, fall into the ocean? was the last time you saw Mount Everest slip into the Indian Ocean or whatever oceans closer to it? Has anybody ever seen a mountain fall into the ocean? No. But the point here is that even if something even if something is earth shattering is that occurs, God is bigger. If the whole world if all of the mountains on earth fell into the waters in the oceans and streams, God is still God. That's what the psalmist is telling us. That no matter what happens in this world, God is bigger and God is stronger in its A reminder that God's strength isn't diminished by such an upheaval. And we can understand it we say amen to that principle. But when we face Crisis and certainty and sick, this and financial loss and all the things that we experienced as human beings, we forget the truth that even if the whole world comes apart, God will not come apart in our trust and confidence in him. So what's the application, Kings may rise and fall, kingdoms may come and go, the stock market may soar and then crash. sicknesses and viruses may sweep the world. But a Christian is unmoved and unafraid, because God is his refuge. And if God is our refuge, there is no need to be afraid. So these first three verses to me, contains such a fundamental and foundational truth that we need to remind ourselves every day of life, especially when we're facing challenges that God is bigger and stronger than the greatest upheaval in our lives. And we have no reason to fear or to be afraid. Secondly, as we look at this text this morning, I want to bring out another truth that we may be sometimes overlooked by reading this passage too quickly. And that is to understand that God's dwelling place is secure, and is protected by God himself. So look at the next few verses over here, and actually going to just focus on verses four and five right now.

Mike Roy  11:33
So look at the the language here in the context, I said, There is a river whose streams make glad the city of God, the holy place for the Most High dwells, God is within her she will not fall, God will help her at break of day. So you see the intentional contrast over here. What is the tone on the earth in in verses one, two, and three, on the earth is war, this oppression, this calamity, this unrest is fighting this uncertainty, all these things on earth? What's the tone in heaven? Look at that joy, gladness, satisfaction, abundance, stability, and complete confidence and assurance. So heaviness described as God's eternal dwelling place. It's a city that is fed by a river, who may God city Vlad is rejoicing there. In fact, in verse five, it says, God is within her, and she will not fail, fall, even if the whole world falls apart. Heavens not going to fall apart, God's eternal home is not going to fall apart. That's what he's saying over here, that God is greater and stronger than his world. And so it's a reminder is there's much uncertainty in the world that we live in, that God's dwelling place, is secure, is protected and defended by God Himself. Again, the language there is God is within her, she will not fall and God will help her at break of day. So again, it's intentional language. It's contrasting language showing us that no matter what goes on in the world that we live in, and throughout history, there's been all types of, excuse me, upheaval in turmoil and loss and sickness and setbacks, and in war and famine, all that type of thing. But that doesn't characterize heaven and God's dwelling place, no matter what's going on on the earth. God Is it perfect peace, in this joy, this satisfaction in heaven, and God's gonna protect his eternal home. So God's dwelling place where he lives, is secure, and is protected by God himself. The third point I want us to notice from this text over here again, this is something that we might read past. If we read this, the psalm too quickly, is to understand this truth that the voice of the Lord is awesome and powerful, just trying to decide how to phrase, this principle, verse seven. We had just read verses four and five, verse set of verse six says this, that nations are in an uproar, and kingdoms fall, he lifts his voice, the earth melts before we look at the rest of the Psalm. Think about what God is telling us in this verse. So the nations are in an uproar. There's all types of fighting, there's destruction, there's war, there's persecution, you name it. Kingdoms fall is that he lives his voice and the earth melts. There's a compelling lesson.

Mike Roy  14:46
I think we need to learn from that. And that is to understand that God's voice is powerful, is majestic, is authoritative. God's word is awesome. God is awesome himself. We live in a world where we throw that word awesome around to carelessly to flippantly, and very often to irreverently, the only one who is truly awesome is God Himself. And so is his word. Sometimes we say, sister, so So made such an awesome apple pie. Or somebody may have noticed a shot I made in basketball. So that was awesome. Not really, it may have been a nice shot, but the only one that is awesome, is God and His voice is awesome. It's powerful. It's authoritative, and what it's telling us over here, that God's word must be heated. He says what He means he means what he says, look at this passage with me. I'm going to or just listen, I'm going to read from Psalm 29, which echoes this same message that we have up here in Psalm and chapter 46. But in Psalm 29, a Psalm of David, it says, Ascribe to the LORD, oh sons of the mighty ascribed to the Lord, glory and strength, Ascribe to the LORD, the glory do his name, worship the Lord and holy array, the voice of the Lord is upon the waters, the God of glory thunders, the Lord is over many waters, the voice of the Lord is powerful. The voice of the Lord is majestic. The voice of the Lord breaks to cedars. Yes, the Lord breaks in pieces, the cedars of Lebanon. He makes Lebanon skip like a calf and Sariah and like a young wild ox, the voice of the Lord Hughes out flames of fire, the voice of the Lord shakes the wilderness. The Lord makes the wilderness of shakes the wilderness of Kadish, the voice of the Lord makes the deer to calf, and strips the force bear in in his temple, everything says, glory. One of the lessons that we have to learn from this passage, as well as Psalm chapter 46, is that God's word is awesome. His His Word is authoritative, and we have to abide by his word. So when God says something, and issues commands, He expects us to obey those those words, God says what He means, and he means what he says. And so we need to recognize that principle. And that's why we say that the nations are in this great big uproar, the kingdoms fall, God raises his voice, and the earth melts. God created the world by the power of his word, he spoke the world into existence by his words. That's how he brought that about. And Isaiah chapter 55, again, echoing this truth, in verses eight through 11, Isaiah says, God speaking through him, for my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways my ways, declares the Lord, as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways in my thoughts than your thoughts as the rain in the snow come down from heaven, and do not return to it without watering the earth and making it bud and flourish. So that it yields seed to the sower and bread for the eater? Look at verse 11. So is my word that goes out from my mouth, it will not return to me empty, but will accomplish what I desire and achieve the purpose for which I sent it. When God speaks, we had better listen, and when all these verses are telling us is that God's voice is authoritative, when he tells us to repent and be baptized, that's exactly what we have to do. Obey specifically the commands that God has given to us. When God says that He loves us believe that. And when God said He will punish and believe that too. And so here in Psalm chapter 46, again, it's reminder, when all this turmoil is taking place, he raises his voice. And it was said the nation's made an uproar, the kingdom's tottered, he raised his voice, and the earth melted at the Word of God, such a powerful truth for us to think about. So God's word is awesome, and it is authoritative. The fourth lesson that I want us to glean from this text in Psalm 46. Again, these are principles that we are aware of, but probably don't apply them to our lives like the art to the God of Heavens armies is our fortress, and is with us. So you go back to this text over here with me.

Mike Roy  19:48
And in verse seven, kind of completing this little section, so the nations are in an uproar, kingdoms fall, he lifts his voice, the earth melts, and then he says As the Lord of the Lord Almighty is with us, the God of Jacob is our fortress. Other translations say that the Lord of hosts is with us. That is, the host has to do with all of those individuals and people supporting God's purposes. Maybe in this context, in particular, is Tom with the armies of God, the angels of God. And so what he's saying over here, that the Lord of Heavens armies is our fortress, the Lord of hosts is with us. He's our hiding place. Again, I just asked a question, did you catch that? Did we, we get the meaning here, the Lord of all creation, who has his majestic, powerful army at his disposal is with you is with me as his sons and daughters. And so in verses six and seven are saying, no matter what upheaval and chaos is occurring in the world, God's powerful presence is with us, we need to think about that, and internalize that truth, that no matter what is going on, that's what the psalmist is saying here in chapter 46, no matter what's going on in the world, are great and powerful, awesome, God whose word is awesome and authoritative, is worth of WISA with us. The God of Jacob is our fortress, he's our refuge, he's our hiding place. And again, this message of God's presence is repeated in Scripture. When you look at Isaiah chapter 41, and God is giving a promise of a restoration and return from the land of captivity for his people, Israel, he wants to assure them that he still loves them, He cares for them, he is going to be with them, he's going to bring them back, he's going to bring restoration and rebuilding to for his people. But look at the language over here. And notice how many personal pronouns are used in reference to God, I loved you, I called you, I care about you, your mind, I am with you, like nine or 10 times in about four versus three verses, all these pronouns, focusing on God. So in verse eight, this is one of the messages in this section of Isaiah chapter 41. That should give Israel great encouragement. And God is saying, but you Israel, My servant, Jacob, whom I have chosen, you descendants of Abraham, my friend, I took you from the ends of the earth, from his farthest corners, I called you, I said, You are my servant, I have chosen you, and have not rejected you. And look at verse 10. So he says, Do not fear, for I am with you? Are you afraid? Let's be honest. Are you afraid? Anxious, a little bit in your life? I know I am at times. But what's the antidote to fear? It's trust and covenant confidence, because God promises to be with us every step of the way. He says, so do not fear for I am with you. Do not be dismayed. Don't give up. Don't throw the towel in. He says, For I am your God. That's the answer to life's dilemmas, to understand that God says, I am your God. Don't be, don't be afraid. Don't be dismayed. Then he says, I will strengthen you and help you. And if I face challenges in my life, and friends, come to my rescue and give me counsel and supported by such a wonderful thing. But if God himself is helping me, I can do anything we can do anything and overcome any difficulty when God is the one giving us the strength. And then at the fourth statement in verse 10, he said, I will uphold you with my righteous right hand. So God is trying to give us the greatest assurance possible for us to know that he is with us, he is going to strengthen us himself. He does that through his words, sometimes he does it with the the assistance of other people. But again, it's just a reminder that this is one of the promises that God has given us in Scripture. And we cannot read pass this quickly over and over and over again, he says to Joshua, and to Moses, and to Peter and to you and to me, I am your God, I love you, I redeemed you. And I will be with you. No matter what you are

Mike Roy  24:36
going through whether it's sickness, or suffering, or financial loss, or some natural catastrophe, God is saying, I'm going to be with you. What's the last thing that Jesus said to His disciples, and Matthew chapter 28. We call this the Great Commission. He said, All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth. Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations bad Putting them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit. That's the authoritative word of God. Remember, God's word is awesome, is authoritative, is powerful. And then verse 20 says, teaching them to observe all that I commanded you. And lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the age, have we forgotten God's promise to be with us always, through thick and thin through, up and down, and and all the uncertainty of life that God is promising to be with us is long is this age, this world last? So, again, in verses six and seven, we come to understand that the Lord of Heavens armies is our fortress, he is our hiding place, he is our refuge, and he promises to be with us. He is with us. The question is, am I going to stay with Him and walk with Him and be with him and read His Word, and fellowship with other Christians at every opportunity that I have. So again, it's an incredible promise. We see in Isaiah chapter 46, at the Lord, the God of Heavens, armies, this majestic, powerful God is with us one of the points that I want us to notice from this text this morning, in Isaiah in Psalm 46. And there's probably several points that we can make from this last section. But I really wanted to bring up one point over here to really, again, anchor this, this message to it is to understand that God wants us to be still and know that He is God. So that's kind of one of the main messages and verses eight through 11. So look at the language over here is this psalm comes to a conclusion. And God is saying, Come and see what the Lord has done. The Psalmist writing come and see what the Lord has done the desolations he has brought on the earth, He makes wars cease, to the ends of the earth, He breaks the bow and shatters the spear, he burns defeat the shields with fire. He says, Be still and know that I am God. I will be exalted among the nations I will be exalted in the earth. And again, this repetition. In verse 11, the Lord Almighty, the Lord of host is with us, the God of Jacob, the God of God's people, Jake, those people, the God of Israel, is our fortress. But you look at the language there. And in verse eight, God is inviting us to think about what he has done all the desolations that he has brought throughout human history. Back in the days of Noah, God sent a global flood that drowned the entire world, everybody perished except Noah and his wife and their three sons, and they're the women that they had married. So eight people were saved in a day, but God sent a flood that completely envelop the world and no estate and the Days of Sodom and Gomorrah when sexual immorality was so rampant, he rained down fire and brimstone and destroyed those cities. And you think through God's promise of the Exodus, bringing his people out of Egypt to the eventually to the promised land, that the Egyptians were breathing down on the Israelites gonna gonna kill them and destroy them. And God brought them into the Red Sea, parted the Red Sea, and then the river, the Red Sea, swallowed them up, and all of the Egyptian armies and Pharaoh himself were all drowned in the ocean. So God is inviting us to remember what he has done. And again, the language is very strong here. He said, He makes war seas he takes powerful powerful things like the bow and the spear, and he breaks them into we might think that the bow that the arrow that the Javelin a powerful but God snapped those into, and it says he burns the shield with fire, all the things that seem to be so powerful, and so intimidating. God completely destroys.

Mike Roy  29:19
But in verse 10, this is really, I think, the message of Psalm 46. And this I like the NIV. It says, he says, Be still and know that I am God. So in times of uncertainty, and financial loss, and sickness and suffering, and death, and all these things are swirling all around us. God is telling us to Cease striving and to know that He is God. The numeric and standard version that I studied from him preach from using that phrase, Cease striving, is translated be still in many of the other translations. Why is it maybe use that word? striving because that's what we do. We strive, we're anxious, we word we try to change things, we would like to change the world, we can't do it. So God is saying, Just be still and know that I am God. And I always will be God. I tell you that one of the greatest challenges for me is learning to be still so anxious. fidgety, my mom said, when I was a kid, always want to move couldn't sit still. God says, sit still, to everybody throughout all human history, and understand I am God, and you are not. And you don't understand what's going to happen tomorrow. But God does understand. And so we have nothing to be afraid of, because our sovereign, powerful, loving, holy, just merciful God still rules from heaven. And heaven will not come apart will not fall apart, even if the whole world falls apart. God's eternal resting place will not fall apart. So there's great lessons, I think that we can learn from this passage. And so the question that we need to each ask ourselves is this question and then we'll close with a prayer. The question is, Is God your refuge? And strength? Are those words kind of foreign to you? Maybe I don't know what a refuge is. We talked about that this morning. But that is the question Is God your refuge? Is he your strength? Is this powerful and holy God, Your God? Is his home going to be your home? If it is, and we have nothing to fear in our lives, if God is not our refuge, and if he's not our strength, strengthen, we need to make him that while we have time and opportunity, so hopefully, this lesson will be helpful for each one of us. Let's close this morning with a word of prayer. Our great and awesome God, we praise You and acknowledge you is the sovereign ruler of heaven and earth, you have all power, or love or holiness or purity or righteousness or justice, or justice, or mercy. We are in awe of you and we are in all of your word, father. And so help us to in times of difficulty or each day that we live run to you as a place of refuge. To understand that you are our strength, you are a present help in times of trouble. And even if the world is falling apart in or if the mountains fall into the heart of the sea, we know that you are still God, you're unaffected by worldly calamity. So we give you praise. We are reminded father of all your powerful actions that you have exerted throughout human history. And we recognize your strength. We recognize your love and your grace and your power. And Help us Father to truly practice to the truths that you have communicated to us in this this psalm. Help us in fact, to be still and to know that you are God we pray this prayer in Jesus name, Amen.
