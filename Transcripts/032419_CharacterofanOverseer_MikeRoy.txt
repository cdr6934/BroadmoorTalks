It is such a great honor for us to come and worship and praise our God. I think I remind our each of us that from time to time, the most satisfying activity that a human being can engage in is praising our great and awesome God. So we're here this morning to do that very thing. trust that God will be glorified in in that process priest appreciate the songs that Jesse left for us this morning. For those who are visiting here, we are in the process of considering the appointment of additional elders and deacons here at Broadmoor. To help facilitate that process. We are preaching on some key texts in the New Testament that relate to the character in the work of overseers and deacons. A couple of weeks ago, Curtis presented a lace a lesson on the process really describing the process by which we may do that kind of laying the foundation, a lot of great things to take away from that one. I think one of the points we have to remind ourselves of is he said, there are no perfect people on this earth no perfect elders. I think the last perfect elders appointed were brother Hudson, Brother Andrews. That's the last time so there's no more out there. Anyway, we remind ourselves that we are all earthen vessels flawed, we have weaknesses, but we are challenged to grow with the very character of Christ. That's what God wants us to achieve in our lives. And, you know, we often see men who are successful in business and think that this is the model for appointing elders and Lord's Church today. But success in business is not the model that God uses. Rather, it is success in the home and family. That is the blueprint by which God prepares and measures men who can serve in the capacity as overseers and elders. So this morning, I want to suggest that we can make a paradigm shift in a couple of key areas. Number one, we need to see that the the the development of an appointment of elders and deacons by using a man's home, in marriage and children as the screening process as the foundation for service as overseers and deacons. Secondly, I like to encourage us when maybe we were doing that, to some degree, not just use the word elder only we just kind of latch on to that word. But let's use other biblical terms like Shepherd and overseer, which really describes the work of elders. The basic meaning of the word elder is in a much older man is not me, I hope.

Mike Roy  02:39
But the reality is, there are several terms in Scripture Shepherd overseer really describes what these men are to do. And the third area that we can maybe do this paradigm shift is move away from the term qualification of elder to the character of an elder just suggesting that we think in those terms, qualification kind of sounds more fitting for man running for political office. And I want to suggest maybe by way of illustration, that a man who spends 30, or 40, or 50 years of his life and selfish, self centered worldly living, and then somehow, when he has children are baptized, he's automatically qualified to be a leader of God's people know actually, all of his younger years as a loving, committed husband and father and teacher, of his children, teacher of other people's children, reveal the character that he has developed over those 20 or 30 or 40 years. And so this will equip him to serve as a shepherd of God's people. And I was talking to brother Caldwell, Friday night before his lesson, we were discussing this. And I think this is kind of a universal feeling among many Christians that we need to be thinking in terms of men who have the character to become overseas. Again, nobody's perfect. We're all imperfect, and we're all flawed, but to think in terms of the character of the person and not just this idea of this qualification, talking to Paul Cook up in Bowling Green recently, and he was saying the same thing. And collies phrase that he shared with me Friday night was he talks about the required characteristics, the required character, these these are characteristics that are required for a man to serve in this capacity. I liked the way he said that. So this morning, we want to talk about the character of an overseer my text this morning, and we'll have more lessons coming tonight and Lord willing and next week from norm and Jeremy and Conrad. But my text then we'd be looking at today is Titus chapter one, the main text verses five through nine. We'll look at some of the verses in that chapter. But basically, what I want to suggest to each of us from this, this text It is that that God through the Apostle Paul is revealing the type of person that he wants to serve in the capacity of as an overseer, as a as a shepherd, as an elder, the word oversee could also be

Mike Roy  05:16
translated Bishop, but he's talking about the character of an overseer. So that's the focus that I want to make this morning. You may have many questions as we go through this process, feel free to talk to any one of us about that, hopefully can generate some discussion, but we want to find out what does God's Word say about overseers? And what type of characters should they have, and what is their work going to be going to consist of? So let's look at the text. I've got this on the screen, Paul's writing to Titus. And he says in verse five, this is why I left you in Crete, so that you might put so that you might put what remained into order, and appoint elders in every town as I directed you. If anyone is above reproach, the husband of one wife, and his children are our believers and not open to the charge of debauchery, or insubordination. For an overseer, as God's steward must be above reproach, he must not be arrogant or quick tempered, or, or a drunkard or violent or greedy for gain, but hospitable, a lover of good, self controlled, upright, holy and disciplined, he must hold firmly to the trustworthy word as taught, so that he may be able to to give instruction and sound doctrine, and also to rebuke those who contradicted so this is one text, think norms can be looking at First Timothy Chapter Three this evening. But this is a blueprint of what God is expecting a wants, and men who are going to serve as overseers as shepherds of his people. And very often, we kind of have a checklist mentality and you know, not greedy, not angry not given the filthy lucre is the King James Version, say the husband, one wife, we kind of miss I think that the flavor of what he's saying. So if you look at this text over here, in verse six, he said, If anyone is above reproach, we'll talk about that in just a minute. So in some ways, this is really the qualification of the principal quality of a man, if he's going to serve as an overseer, you must be above reproach. And then in verse seven, it says, For an overseer, as God's steward must be above reproach. So really, if you simplify it, and very basic terms of really the quality that God is looking for, for men who are going to serve as overseers, they're going to be above reproach. And then he illustrates that by all these things, the husband of one wife, as a father, not greedy, not filled with pride, and all that type of thing. And so I want to suggest, again, this is what I'm calling a kind of a paradigm shift. Instead of just looking at every little detail and kind of a checklist, mentality, look at what the what he's saying twice, he says it in this text, and it's going to come up in the other text as well. God wants men who are above reproach. That's the issue. Doesn't mean perfect, because nobody, nobody's perfect. But that's really what he's talking about. Now. He's gonna go through here and explain what that means. So let me just do that quickly here and we'll come back and look at these. So a man in order to serve as an overseer must be this language is strong, must be above reproach. So let's get a handle on that. So he must be above reproach, as the husband of one wife, as a father whose children are believers and not open to the charge of debauchery and insubordination. This is the ESV he must be above reproach is a man who is not arrogant. He must be above reproach is a man who is not quick tempered. above reproach is a man who is not a drunkard. He must be above reproach is a man who is not violent. The surprising to have that in there, but it's a it's a character that a one of the characters of man to who would be considered as an overseer. He must be above reproach to the man who is not greedy for gain. So when I'm against suggesting in the least some ways, and I'm not alone, in this view, a lot of people take this view fact I was looking at Burton Kaufman's commentary. He was a member of the Lord's Church years ago, priest in New York City, but he was making the same point that the real the real quality, or characteristic that God is looking for is a man who is above reproach. If we're not above reproach, there's no way that a man can serve effectively and overseeing God's people. And all these things illustrate how he is above reproach.

Mike Roy  09:54
I think we have to first look at the question. What does it mean to be above reproach, since we've already established we will probably say this frequently, over the next week or two, whatever, that nobody is sinless, and nobody is perfect. We're all imperfect people. But we have a desire and commitment to do God's will, to lead our families and holiness and faithless to seek to lead God's family the same way to be above reproach. Here's the Greek word and went back and look this, I can't really pronounce this, I did take two years of Greek in college, and a plate this and that's not how it's pronounced when I looked at by his dictionary, but anyway, that's the word. And it means that cannot be laid hold of hands not open to censure or irreproachable. And say that again, slowly that cannot be laid hold of, hence, not open to censure, irreproachable, this is Vives, Expository Dictionary of New Testament words. So for a person to be above reproach he's talking about, you can't make a charge against that person and substantiate it. There's no evidence to support that. I like to comment from em Xur and his commentary, he said, the word has reference to the standing a man has among men, that no one is able to make any specific accusation against his character or conduct. That is, no one must be able to make such accusation and support it with the truth. Anybody can make a charge against anybody. But it cannot be and must not be proven. There must not be any evidence to support that if we're going to support a man to serve in the capacity as an overseer. So I think that's helpful to think about. What does it mean to be above reproach, not perfect, there's nobody who is perfect. But it means that you cannot bring a charge against his character or his life, his behavior with here's hardcore evidence, this man is a liar. This man is a cheat, this man is greedy for gain. So that again illustrates what it means to be above reproach. We'll talk about that. In just a minute. Many translations have rendered this way an elder must be blameless, that's the NIV, the new came German King James Version, I guess, the King James version as well. blameless means you, he cannot be blamed for sin, blamed for failures that cannot be brought against him. The contemporary English version puts it this way, an elder must not be guilty of doing wrong. We're all again, we're all human, we all strive to do the very best that we can. But he's talking about a someone who is is not practicing sense, somebody who's not that sin cannot be tagged on that person. And that is that it has stuck to his character. So let's talk about this. As we discussed this question this morning. And I want to suggest as we think about this text, and Titus chapter one, especially with my paradigm shifted, I'm suggesting that we think in terms of the character of a man, not so much the qualification, I can understand the sense of qualification, but the real the flavor is his character. And that's kind of what qualifies him to serve in this capacity. So the question I want you to ask, as we look at these statements, the negative ones, and the positive ones, ask the question, Is Paul talking about qualification? Like, if I just do this, then this I can get there? Or is he talking about the character of the man? So be thinking to yourself about that this morning? Is Paul talking about qualification or character? So he must be above reproach? He must be the husband of one wife. What does that mean? So again, the question is, is the emphasis on being married one time, and if a man dies, he can't be an elder. Again, if you've married some faithful chrysalis, let's think about that. So is it the emphasis on being a married man married just one time or is it on his character as a loving, committed husband? This phrase indicates he is a one woman, man, my wife is my woman. I have no other I've got daughter's mother. But he's talking about a one woman man, that's what he's saying over here. And what that says is that he is totally and completely committed to loving, honoring and caring for his wife. He doesn't run around on his wife, a husband of one wife, I think that's the phrase there. He doesn't spend time flirting with other women at work or even at church. The point is, he is committed to his wife.

Mike Roy  14:44
So we talked about that this morning. Maybe in our class, I get heavy having a senior moment here. But but that's that's the point that when we make a promise and a vow to our spouses, is forever, you can't get out of it, the only thing that can break a marriage vow is adultery by God's standard. So he's a husband of one wife, he is committed to his wife, and she is his woman. Now, as we discussed this just for our own our own understanding, what if you have this godly man's been serving faithfully as an overseer of God's family and local congregation? What if his wife dies? Is he no longer that character? Well, we still have that character. So let me say that he could continue to serve. Or he might step down for a lot of different reasons. Maybe people might express their opinion. And maybe, for personal reasons, he decides to step down. What if this man who has demonstrated over the last 40 years or 50 years, he's a man of character, his wife dies, and he marries a Christian, who's a faithful godly woman? Is he not the husband of one wife, but he still is. He still is his wife guide. Now he's married a godly woman. He's faithful to his wife. In a superficial way, sometimes, maybe we've all thought this with up the husband of one wife, I don't care what happened to brother so and so his wife died, he can never serve again. Is that what the text is saying that he's married one time? I think the text is saying he is the husband of one wife, that's he's a one woman, man, he's committed to his wife. Come What May. And so if she happens to die, and he marries a faithful Christian, he's still my view, a one woman man. So again, we want to have some understanding of what the text is saying. And we'll spend not as much time on each of these. But so when we talk about a man who is above reproach, that means that he's a he's a godly husband. And then the next characteristic that we talked about when we're asking the question, is this character or is it some qualification, he must be above reproach as a father in the new. The ESP puts this in connection with the children, others may put it in connection with the man but he must be above reproach as a father whose children are believers and not open to the charge of debauchery, and insubordination. So again, the template that God uses to prepare men for the work of Overseer and shepherd is the home. I hope that's the filter that you get this morning, that the basis for church leadership in God's kingdom is the home. How is he doing as a father? How is he doing as a husband? How's he doing in raising his children? That's the emphasis. And so, in particular, God wants us to focus on the question how well he serves as a father and whether he has 1234 or more children. And my understanding isn't as significant is when we're talking about the godly character of an individual. So again, that's the filter. I want to suggest to us this morning that he must be above reproach, as a father, who has children that children aren't perfectly, but he has godly children who is who are going to serve God and be faithful to Him. Now, sometimes, we have questions. And sometimes people might object to a man who has only one child, is if maybe he is automatically disqualified to serve as an overseer of God's family. Again, we're thinking, let's just find what this the text what's the emphasis of the text on some type of qualification? Or is it on character? I think it's on character. And when we consider common English usage, as well as the scriptures, we can kind of maybe get a view on how we might answer this. So for example, when the captain of a ship on a sinking ship says, women with children get into lifeboats first, and the woman says, looks at her young son, Johnny says, Johnny, we can't get into boat because I just have one child, know, the woman and that's the son get in the boat. We understand how language is used like that, in Genesis chapter 21, from a scriptural perspective, and the verses five through seven talks about Abraham was 100 years old when Isaac was born to him. And Sarah said that God has made laughter from me. Everyone who hears will laugh over me and this was Sarah said, and she said, who would have said to Abraham that Sara would nurse children.

Mike Roy  19:36
Yet I have born him a son in his old age. So, again, there may be differences of view on that and we understand that and encourage further discussion. But as I look at the text, the template is a godly father. If you're raising 123 or 10 children, if you demonstrate that then That is the type of person that God is looking for. And in some ways if a person has two or three or four children is have more experience in that that type of thing. But really, if you think about it, a person who raises one son or daughter to be faithful in God's sight, and do that successfully achieved something that is more difficult if you have two or three or four children, but again, I just make that point, that he is above reproach. He's above reproach, as a father, as a godly father. Again, whether it's 2316 to nine children, again, you look at the text over here, as we talked about the the character of an overseer, that he is, must be above reproach is a man who is not arrogant. So obviously, if a man is proud and conceded in his heart, then he doesn't have the character that God requires for him. And in order for him to serve Him. So the point I make here in all of these things, that he isn't above reproach. That's the point he's got to be above reproach. And if a man is guilty of pride in arrogance and conceit, he's not he doesn't have the character that God is looking for. Again, we'll go through some of these quickly, he must be above reproach is a man who is not quick tempered. Again, for some of us, that's more of a challenge than others. I know. And even as a kid, somebody did me wrong, I was just, I was in in flame, I just lost control of my temper, in an instant. I've tried to temper that through the years. But the point is, if a man cannot control his temper or his anger, and if a man flies off the handle it some frustration. The point is, he's not above reproach. That's the big template, he needs to be above reproach in all these areas of his life. Another one, a man who is not a drunkard. You would think somebody, especially going to be considered for the work in the service of oversight is not going to be controlled by alcohol. But if a person is a struggles with alcohol, which obviously affects his judgment, again, the the point I make here is that he's that he's not above above reproach in that regard, trust that for most Christian men. That's not an issue, but some people, it is an issue. And for many of you have grew up in the Lord's church, you don't know the temptation of alcohol, I know it firsthand. I was a drunk in my younger days. I know I know what it was like, know the taste, I know the buzz, all of that stuff. And if you're not careful, alcohol will ruin your life. And there's so many dangers and warnings about that. We talked about that in our class this morning. So he must be above reproach is a man who is not a drunkard. He's not violent. What does that mean? Well, again, it may seem pretty far fetched to most of us that a Christian man would actually be violent in his relationship with his wife or children, or fellow Christians. But all of us know individuals, man who have gotten to a fistfight with a fellow Christian is terrible. If a man can't control his temper, if he is a violent man, then he is not suited to be an overseer of God's people, because there'll be tense moments and people will challenge him on issues or whatever, and you don't settle it with your fist. For too many times. Throughout history, men have tried to do that. And so he must be above reproach is a man who's not violent. Again, he must be above reproach is a man who is not greedy for gain. So again, we understand and I think the King James Version, he uses the word he's not greedy for filthy lucre. When's the last time you've used that phrase in your discussions? Well, filthy lucre lemming really means dirty money. And that means money acquired through questionable or dishonest means. So if a man's underhanded and how it gets his income, that's a red flag like, buddy, we don't want that kind of a man overseeing God's people. And possibly receiving support is now that Bible talks about that we don't really think about that much today. But that's true. And the point I make in addition, that if a fallen man talks about is his money, his wealth, his investments as property,

Mike Roy  24:35
then that would be a red flag to me that if he's if He's greedy for gain, then we need to be aware of this. So as we again we think about putting forth names of individuals in this congregation. For the possible work of elder and Deacon we need to be asking those questions also. So we were looking then at the negative character of man that they must not be greedy, prideful and this type of thing. And the positive side is also qualities that a man must have, he must be above reproach in terms of a man who is hospitable. And so that means he hospitality in the original language really refers to one who loves strangers. So he must love people love to have people in his home. But it's not just limited to having people in his home. I think this word really involves things like meeting the needs of others checking on the sick and the hurting, even helping them financially. So he must be he must have that that quality as a man who is hospitable, he is a person who loves what is good, I'm gonna just put these up here, make some comments about all of these, you must love what is good. He is a man who is self controlled. So this is the the positive side and contrast to the negative warning you're given just a minute ago. He is a man who is upright, he is a man who is holy. He is a man who is disciplined. The point I make here is that that that God is looking for individuals, men, who are good, wholesome, clean, honest family, man, I think that's the the whole emphasis that they're not governed by earthly desires or impulses. They do love what is good, they do what love what is right, they are self control, they have to have that level of self control, they're upright, they're holy, they're set apart from the world, they're not going to be conformed to this world, they're disciplined. So they these ideas come up over and over again. And then it says is one who holds firm to the trustworthy word as taught. So that's a positive quality as we think about additional men who might serve especially as elders and the way that we can think this evening with norms lesson about deacons. One of the qualities of a man that God is looking forward to lead his people is someone who is is going to hold firm to the Word of God, and say, not gonna back down to present modern day trends and liberal ways of thinking. So he's gonna hold firm to trustworthy word as taught. So we have both positive and negative qualities that are discussed over here that we can think about in terms of the type of individual that God is looking for. So you look again, at this, the text put up on a screen, the big picture, again, you may have certain disagreements with things that I've said, we can certainly talk about that. But in the big picture this what Paul was telling Titus, this is why I left you in Crete. Titus, and to appoint elders in every town, as I directed you, if anyone is above reproach, an elder must be above reproach. And this is all the way that it's illustrated. So the man who's going to serve in that capacity must be and it makes sense. If we can lay a charge against a man as some who's greedy, prideful, hot tempered, doesn't have control of his children. How can you take care of the Church of God, that's the one of the points that will come up in First Timothy chapter three. So this was why Paul left Titus in Crete, to appoint elders in every town and every church as he had directed him. And then notice practically in the last part of verse nine, I'm not going to talk logistics because it's on the screen. So this shows what the elders do what overseers do what shepherds do, well, so that he may be able to give instruction and sound doctrine, and also to rebuke those who contradict it. So a couple of things that a shepherd does in his birds. And he gives instruction and sound doctrine. So often, we think about the preachers, and I know in some ways, because I've been preaching here a long time, and then serving is one of the elder for 10 years, still see me as a preacher. But if I'm kind of wearing two hats at it at different times here, amen. But the point I was saying is that so often, we think that the preacher is the one who gives instruction. The preacher is the one who rebuked but the truth is, the elder does that the overseer does that. And they really both do it together.

Mike Roy  29:24
He is he's able to give instruction and sound doctrine, and also able to rebuke those who contradict it. So that went through with thinking about men to conserve in this capacity, we want men who are willing to rebuke those who are teaching what is false, not afraid to do that. So here's the last part of the text. I want to read quickly before we bring the lesson to a close this morning. So this is the rest of the context of Titus chapter one. So Paul tells time is that there are many, he says, four there are many who are insubordinate, empty talkers and deceivers, especially those of the circumcision. In verse 11. He says they must be silenced. Since they are upsetting whole family by teaching for shameful gain. There's the greedy person among them. They're teaching for shameful gain what they ought not to teach. So he's telling Titus is a part of your task, young Titus, that you need to silence these people who are doing these things. This is one of the cretins a prophet of their own said Cretans are always liars, evil beast, lazy gluttons, can you imagine planting a church to the Lord in Crete? Wow. Know the young man out in San Francisco. Our family knows him Josh Lewis, along with maybe another guy preaching in San Francisco. The gospel is for all the Lord's church can flourish anywhere on earth if we're faithful to His word. So Paul's telling Titus, that this is the context that he's living in. And then he said in verse 13, this testimony is true. Therefore, he said, rebuke them sharply. That's the work of preaching, teaching, that they may be sound in a faith not devoting themselves to Jewish myths and the commands of people who turn away from the truth. To the pure all things appear, but to the defiled and unbelieving, nothing is pure, but both their minds and their consciences are defiled. They profess to know God, but they deny him by their works. They are detestable, disobedient, unfit for any good work. Can you imagine a young preacher in that environment? Can you imagine the shepherds who are going to be appointed to oversee this local flock of people in a context of such moral corruption and ungodliness. But the gospel is for all God is bigger than our struggles and bigger than sin, and we can overcome whatever comes our way. So I want to suggest one of the thoughts this morning, before we wrap up the lesson and sing the invitation song. What I'm suggesting by way of Titus chapter one that God is looking for men of character, to serve as overseers for his people, lots of questions can come up about the husband of one wife and his children and how many children he has and all these other things, but God's looking for people of character. So I think that's what I would encourage each of us to think about as you look over this congregation think about men who whom you might suggest that would serve as elders. What type of character they have, they're not perfect again, we'll say it till I'm blue in the face. I don't think I'm blue yet but, but we're looking for men of character. And really is we extend the invitation song this morning. When I suggest that read the character that God is looking for in his people isn't really different from an overseer. He wants us to be holy and pure and upright, and good husbands, good wives, faithful wives and in good chill. He wants us to have the character that would reflect His holiness and His righteousness be here this morning. This lesson isn't designed and teaching. The Gospel throws Lawson sin but if you haven't obeyed the gospel, what God wants from you, is to ultimately become a person of character. It's not just obeying these five steps of salvation. It's changing your life, believing that Jesus is the Christ, repenting of sin, changing your character hating sin, confessing your faith in him being baptized and watered, have your sins forgiven, that you might be a child of God transformed into the very image of Christ. If there any of this morning that needs to respond to the gospel, might come always stand and sing the invitation song
