Unknown Speaker  00:01
as Trevor mentioned in his his prayer, we are in the midst of considering the appointment of additional elders and deacons to the church here at Broadmoor. A couple of weeks ago, Kurt, presented a lesson on the appointment of elders that process. And this morning, Mike presented a lesson from Titus chapter one. There are two texts that deal with characteristics of elders. And that is Titus chapter one. First Timothy three, I do commend Mike's lesson to you from this morning. And if you didn't get a chance to listen to that, I would encourage you to do so. I'm not sure why I got the longer text. But I did. So just be aware that it's gonna take a little bit longer to cover both the elders and deacons. First Timothy three is the only passage we have that does care cover the characteristics of of deacons. So I will have to move up rather quickly. But I won't, I'll try not to move so quickly that I won't be understandable. My PowerPoint will be available to you if you would like it, I will make that available because I will have a lot on the screen and probably too much for you to take down all the notes but obviously take down as much as you would like to. So I will be reviewing the character of elders and deacons as described in First Timothy three. And first, in that passage, of course, is the description of the characteristics of elders in verses one through seven. And I'd like to just go ahead and read those verses. Verse one, this saying is trustworthy, if anyone aspires to the Office of overseer he desires a noble task. Therefore an overseer must be above reproach the husband of one wife so reminded, self controlled, respectable, hospitable, able to teach not a drunkard, not violent but gentle, not quarrelsome, not a lover of money. He must manage his own household well with all dignity, keeping his children's submissive for someone does not know how to manage his own household, how will eat care for God's church, he must not be a recent convert, or he may become puffed up with conceit and fall into the condemnation of the devil. And then verse seven, moreover, he must be well thought of by outsiders so that he may not fall into disgrace into a snare of the devil. So that first verse, the saint is trustworthy. If anyone aspires to the Office of overseer, he desires a noble task. You can bank on it that the work of an overseer is honorable and good, and he will be outlining those characteristics as he goes on. In Paul's letter to Timothy, the term for overseer are the term that are used for overseers and elders and so forth in the New Testament. There are three terms and I'm not going to cover these in depth because I don't want to step on what Jeremy and Conrad may do in next week. But from three terms elder comes from the word Presbyterians as we saw in Titus this morning. The Pisco pose is overseer which we see in our passage tonight, First Timothy three, one and employment, which is translated shepherd or pasture, as we see in first Peter five, two. And there are other passages, of course that contain these words, and they're used interchangeably. You can see that, that in the passages I have on the screen you saw it this morning in Titus chapter one that they're used interchangeably. And there's always a plurality of elders, as we see demonstrated in the New Testament. But the terms as defined, define the function of the overseers. An elder is older, he, therefore he can lead and teach based on his experience, an overseer overseas he looks upon he inspects, and a shepherd or pastor carries the idea of carrying and tending and feeding like a shepherd would for his flock. And if you look at these terms, it is similar to what a father would do for his children. A father leads and teaches he feeds and tins he protects, and he inspects and oversees the father does all those things. So those those terms do apply to the overseer of the church or the local congregation.

Unknown Speaker  04:40
verses two through six really comprise one single sentence and you don't see that in the as well as in the ESV as you do in the New American Standard. So I want to put that on the screen. Look at the New American Standard Version of verses two through six He said two through seven before two through six makes make up one sentence. If you if you look at the, all the commas and also look at the words in italics, which are added to the text to make it more readable. But then if you were to take out the verse numbers which we add, and the italicized words which men add, you get a sentence like that. It is one long sentence and overseer, then Miss must be above reproach the husband, one wife, temperate, prudent, and so on. And then even down with the passage that talks about keeping his children under control is followed by a parenthetical phrase, which which makes sense. There's no punctuation in the original Greek, we add that as well, to make it readable for us in the English language. So I do think and I do agree with Mike that I think we can put a colon or a dash after the word above reproach in the top line, because I think that is the general description of the elder as outlined in First Timothy three that he must be abrupt above reproach and then the rest of the sentence explains what's that what that means. That's the context. In which above reproach is defined, we can't define above reproach anyway, we want to, it's defined by what follows. The first term above reproach and then in the the last part of the text, verse seven, which makes up the second sentence, we see the word reproach again, which gives us bookends to, to the characteristics of the characteristic traits of the elder or overseer. Now, let me say a little bit about the two the two passages before I get into the text much this this evening. Like I said, there are two main passages in the New Testament that describe the character of the elder in Titus one in First Timothy three, if you were to put those characteristics side by side, as we all know, they're not the same. They are a little bit different. Some of the words are exactly the same, but they are not the same list and I use the word list accommodate lovely. But remember that you have one writer of both of these letters, Paul would not have written Timothy and Titus, different things, so they could come up with different type of men. His purpose was to come up with the same type of man, in his letters to Timothy and Titus are the readers of those would select the same type of men. And remember also that we don't know if the original readers of these letters had copies of each other's letters, they most probably didn't win the readers of Timothy's letter, read those characteristics, he would have selected a man very similar, if not the same as the readers of Tituss letter. Now, we typically take those two lists because we have both copies and we combine them, then compare them. But maybe we shouldn't do that. Maybe we should do as the original readers did read one letter, and those characteristics, and then later on, read the other letter examined each one separately first, just as the original readers did. And if their qualifications, then Timothy and Titus had different checklist. If you want to think of it that way. Would Timothy's elder did Paul want that elder to be different than Titus his elder? Well, of course not. He was writing about the same type of man. And if they didn't have each other's lists, so if you're going to think in that way they had incomplete list. Well, of course they didn't. They had what they needed to select the type of man that Paul had in mind. And I will just suggest, if Paul had written a third letter about elder character traits to save Silas, I'm pretty confident that the traits would have been slightly different in that letter, pretty much the same, but slightly different. Because it's a general description of the same type of man. Remember, it's the same author with the same intent. And I also will say that they're not exhaustive, exhaustive list, because there's nothing said about being kind. For example, there's nothing said about being truthful.

Unknown Speaker  09:50
But certainly you would expect an elder to be truthful and be kind. If their exhaustive list then you can appoint a liar. You can appoint someone that's not truthful. And of course, that's ridiculous. And you might say, well, that's understood. Well, how is that understood? It's understood because we know it's covered under, above reproach, blameless. He's blameless in those areas. These are generalists describing the character of the man that Paul had in mind, there's probably many other things that could be added to the list, think fruit of the Spirit Galatians five, those things, perhaps could have been added, and some of them are in included. And also remember that the character described here is not really that much different than any Christian. What's different is the degree and area of responsibility of the overseer or elder. Feel free to talk with me about that later. That's, that's my take on on that. And I know some disagree with that. But I would just say study at first. Perhaps this goes against what you've always thought always what you've been taught, but just study it first. And then if you still have questions about that, we will be glad to talk to you about that. So the character of the man has to be above reproach and reproach means blame or censure, he will not be a person with whom fault is found on a regular basis. So when you think of this person, you don't immediately think that's a disgraceful man. You don't think that he's above that he's above blame. He's above reproach. But as I said before, First Corinthians, First Timothy three actually gives us the context in which to define above reproach, a man has to be above reproach. And here's what I mean by that. And I outlined this or put it in this form, I haven't changed the text, I just put it in, in form. So we can look at each one of these separately and quickly. And you'll notice that the first one, the husband of one wife, you know, that's the top of both list. If you notice that, that's the importance of the being the husband of 151 wife, it's the first characteristics and in both of the text that does show its importance, it's spiritual value. And as, as Mike said, this morning, the husband of one wife actually means one woman, man, if you go back to the original Greek, so if you think of it that way, one woman man, well, what might that imply? Well, the new English Bible translates it faithful to his one wife, it might mean that in these boxes, I'm going to put some other translations, other ideas or definitions, I won't necessarily refer to them all, but they're there for you to look at. And that faithful to one wife seems to imply he is married, and he has or will have only one wife, and he's always faithful to her. Certainly it does mean he's not polygamous. I think we could probably all agree on that seems to be an obvious conclusion.

Unknown Speaker  13:08
But does it doesn't mean he's currently married. What if his wife dies? What if he's been married for

Unknown Speaker  13:16
three or four decades, as a an as an elder, he suddenly becomes a widower and he doesn't remarry?

Unknown Speaker  13:25
Isn't a still a one woman man. Can he continue as an elder? Well, I would ask why. Why wouldn't he has? Has his character changed?

Unknown Speaker  13:34
That's just a question that I think we should consider. What? What if he's been married for 3540 years, and then he has to divorce his wife for her adultery? He's completely innocent. But she has committed adultery, he he divorces her on scriptural grounds can can he still be and he continues as an elder, candy, continuous and elder? Is he still considered a one woman? Man? It's a good question. He still learned much as a husband, he hasn't dis learned that just because he had to divorce his wife. I'll leave that one for you to ponder. Some have even said is that there could be a case when a single never married man could serve. What if his attitude is that of a one woman man is that a man always should only ever have one wife and always be faithful to her. That's what he teaches. He always teaches that. Well, I have a problem with that view myself. Because later it appears Paul assumes he is a family man because he does talk about children and his household. And you can't really be a pastor of Shepherd without being a father and husband. So I would have some problems with that particular view. So it would be difficult for me to recommend a never married man. So the context to me seems to him by, and at least one time married man. But I believe there could be cases where a single man could serve such as a widower, but certainly a married man must be faithful to his wife. There's much more we can say about that. And I'll also recommend you back to Mike's lesson this morning for more comments on that. He must be sober minded. Some of these I'll go through quickly. Temperate, are composed, collected, even tempered. So a man that subjected to prolonged fits of anxiety or depression, would not meet this description. He wouldn't be above reproach in that area, he must be self control or prudent, sensible or discreet. He's in control of his addictions or impulses in his life. He's respectable of good behavior. He's modest and seemingly, and fitting is He above reproach in those areas of his life. He is hospitable, or given to hospitality, it actually means a friend to strangers. And in Bible culture, where travel was difficult, and perhaps one a long ways from home had no place to stay, or was very hungry. Where that was a problem. People went out of their way to show kindness to strangers think about Abraham, entertaining the the men who later he found out were sent from God. People then knew that they might be in the same predicament one day, and they showed kindness to strangers. So how does that fit in our culture? It's more than just having dinner for your friends at home. Although that's important and good. We could ask has the man ever shared his home? Or has he ever shared anything that's his is the mankind to strangers? How does he treat those he doesn't know? Does he go out of his way to help someone in need? And I might Parijat project here is the stranger someone he thinks he needs to share the gospel with? How does he treat the stranger? Able to teach our app to teachers, the old King James says he is an able teacher. He's a skillful teacher, and implies a knowledge of Scripture. He doesn't leave all the teaching to the preacher or those that are more skilled and he he takes an active role in teaching both publicly and privately He is a teacher that's part of his nature. Being a teacher is bound up in the nature of being an elder overseer. It's what an overseer and what a father does naturally. So is the man above reproach in that area? Or is he have does he have some blame in that area.

Unknown Speaker  18:02
He is also not a drunkard, not given to wine or not addicted to wine, the New American Standard says alcohol, alcohol does not control him. And he's not addicted to it. Literally it means near wine is wine or alcohol always near him, always within reach, so to speak. He He is above criticism in this area. In some versions, it's linked to the next word in our text violent, which is a natural outcome of drunkenness. So he's, he's not controlled by alcohol. And I might add to that, what about anything that might impair him might add drugs of any kind or medications that he perhaps could be addicted to? That's, I think that might fall under or at least be related to this idea that he's not violent, but gentle. He's not Ignatius, but he is patient and equitable. He's not always looking for a fight. He's not combative. That's not his nature. He's gentle. He's just the opposite of violent, he's calm, he's fair. He's patient. He's equitable. The next word is similar. He's not quarrelsome. It means he's uncontentious. He's not always argumentative. It doesn't mean he gives in to every disagreement that he has. In fact, he needs to uphold the truth of the gospel. So that's going to mean disagreeing with people from time to time, but where there's disagreement, he's still kind, and he's still gentle and he's still patient. Is the man blameless in this area of his life? Or is he argumentative by nature? He's not a lover of money. And in our culture, that can be a real problem, especially when the economy is going well. And you know that you can be a lover of money and not actually have it. It's an attitude towards money and riches. And at the same time, you could be very well off, but still not be a law. of her of money. It's very difficult to ascertain in someone because that's usually kept very private. How does that play out in his life? What can you see that might evidence itself in his life in this area, the man is not materialistic, this world and all it has is not his God. I remember something that brother Gil Chaffin said years and years ago, he said Be thankful you don't have any more money than you have. And that's always stuck with me. It's very important because God may be limited in limiting us on the amount of wealth we have, because he knows we can't deal with anymore, because we might have a problem with it. Is he above reproach in this area, look at the characteristics that are on the screen there in verses two and three is any of those not describe a Christian in general. All of those do describe a Christian we all are supposed to not be the husband of one wife after that. Be sober minded, self controlled, respectable, hospitable. All of those things, those those are what all Christians should attain to. Next, it's managed his own household well with all dignity, keeping his children, submissive. And I've got the the net version, the ne t and the NLT. Let me read those must manage his own household well and keep his children in control without losing his dignity. Another translation is in the NLT must manage his own family well with children who respect and obey Him. This is very important. The man shows himself to be a good manager first in his family. How one raises his children is one of the most indicative insights into the character of a man. The children demonstrate what the parent allows. What the parent feels is important or unimportant. If a child is unruly and defiant, with no respect for authority, the father has allowed that to happen. How's that man going to garner any respect as an elder. And let me just talk to the young fathers for just a second. It's imperative that your children respect your authority. You are mimicking the role of God to your very young children. You're not God, but you're mimicking that role. If they don't respect you, they will not respect God. Does doesn't mean you rule your family with an iron fist, but you do discipline that's not left to all the disciplines not left to the mother. It's not left to the school. You are in charge of the discipline of your trial.

Unknown Speaker  22:57
Teaming with your your wife, of course, they must respect you and you earn that respect. By the way you act and speak. You're not a poser, you're not a hypocrite. You live out your faith. That is the best way you can teach your child. You demonstrate it to your children and they will see it. You serve your family by loving them and fulfilling your role. The family is training ground for the managing and care of the church. The same is true of the flock you serve the church by loving it. You serve the church by loving it and fulfilling your role as an elder you serve with all dignity. And the flock will follow those that humbly lead. Let me say a word about children. And I do agree with my take on having one child versus multiple. And for several reasons, and I'll explain myself. The good character of the elder can be expressed in raising one child versus raising more than one. You might have heard that raising multiple children prepares you more for being an elder. Well, maybe that so but haven't we kind of extended what the scripture says there. You might also argue that raising a single child to not be self centered and lazy is just as difficult as raising multiple children. But what is the text say? Well to argue that this that this must must mean multiple children doesn't follow good scriptural analysis in my opinion, consider Ephesians six for fathers don't provoke your children. Is it okay if you just have one child to provoke that child? Well, of course not. That's that's silly. We would say no, don't provoke your single child either. But it's to include fathers that have just one child and fathers that have multiple children. It is stated that way. First Timothy five four but if a widow has children or grandchildren, let them first make some return to their parents. What if there's only one child? Is he exempt from that responsibility? Well, no. Again, it's just inclusive of all situations. Deuteronomy six, seven, you shall teach these words diligently to your children. If you have one child, you don't have to teach him? Of course not. It's inclusive. It's called the indefinite plural. And it includes those with one child and multiple children. It doesn't. It also doesn't follow our good English language usage. So if I were to say all parents bring your children down here to the front right now, well, that would that exclude Mike and Darby and Jeremy and Lauren, and Mike and Rihanna, because they just have one child? Well, no, we understand that, that it's an it's an inclusive and it's an indefinite plural. Some will say appointing only men with multiple children is the safe course not put that in quotes? Well, I would submit that a safe course is not always the best course. Because you may be prohibiting some good godly men that actually made the characteristics that are outlined in Scripture in the New Testament, to be elders and shepherds and overseers. Our instructions are to appoint faithful men to serve not look for ways to disqualify them. Obviously, we have to follow scripture, before we appoint any man, and we must study it carefully. Let's not be bent on disqualifying men, when there are good men that that meet these character traits and could faithfully serve. Let's study it carefully. He is not a recent convert. Or he may be because he may become puffed up with conceit and fall into the condemnation of the devil. The NET Bible says not a recent convert, or he may become arrogant and fall into the punishment, that the devil will exempt or not be a new Christian because he might be proud of being chosen so soon, and the devil will use that pride to make him fall I think those are translations that help us see what perhaps is meant there. A relatively new convert lacks the skill and wisdom that years of being a Christian bring. An older man can be new to the faith, he might bring his worldly ideas of being a CEO or president of his company to the church, he hasn't learned yet the idea of loving, sacrificial service. That brings us to our second sentence, which says, Moreover, he must be well thought of by outsiders so that he may not fall into disgrace into a snare of the devil.

Unknown Speaker  27:58
Not only must he be above reproach within the church, but he must be thought of well outside the church.

Unknown Speaker  28:13
The net says well thought of by those outside the face that faith so he may not fall into disgrace and to be caught by the devil's trap, you may be able to determine if a man has the qualities we've been over so far. But what about those those outside the church? What about those that are in business with him? A share an office with him? What what did they think of him? Is he a good employee or employer?

Unknown Speaker  28:37
What it was coworkers describe him as? Is he good? Is he a good neighbor? If you were to go talk to his next door neighbor?

Unknown Speaker  28:44
How does he treat the server at the restaurant? I think it's entirely appropriate for you if you are considering a certain man put his name forward for consideration. I think it's entirely appropriate for you to ask him for his boss's email. And just ask about what kind of employee This is. Or maybe you asked him one of his employees, what kind of bosses you ever thought about doing that? How are you going to know how he's thought of by outsiders? How you going to know that? Show up one day and talk to his neighbor? seems kind of strange, but how else are you going to know how he's thought of by others? How many of us would do that? Being above reproach extends to beyond the church building walls, to to treat your brothers with love. And then in turn around and treat your employees with scorn is being two faced as being hypocritical and that's really approachable. So how would your coworker describe you if you are being considered as an as an elder? Would they say you're kind and giving or would they say well, you see just quiet kind of quiet. It keeps himself. Remember being a Christian is letting your light shine. It doesn't mean blinding people with your light. But it means kindly and respectfully letting people know that you're a child of God, and you're not a child of the world. You've noticed in these last two phrases that the devil is mentioned, in his last few characteristics, these terms may have to do with being turned over to Satan for a certain purpose in some way to be taught a lesson that needs to be learned, or and being lured into the the devil's trap of being hypocritical. That's the devil's trap it, it may may be the lesson here. But the use of these terms indicates the extreme importance of the character of the overseer. Let me make a few general comments about the eldership before we move on it, if you're not seen as shepherding in some way, now, while not being an elder, you may not be fit to be an elder. If you're not seen in some way as being a father figure, to people outside your family, you may not be the best elder or overseer. And remember that we lead by serving we don't lead by lording it over other people. There are those that might say, they might seem to be above reproach, and meet those characteristics, but they might personally say I'm not ready to be an elder. And that may be true, you may have some characteristic you're working on that none of us know about that you need to work out. And if that's true, you don't need to be an elder. That's true. But remember, that ability plus opportunity does equal responsibility. And one day, you need to step up and be an elder, and work on those things you're deficient in, to take on that responsibility. So you can be a faithful overseer of a congregation. Remember to, as Mark mentioned this morning, that they appointed elders on Crete, and you remember how they were described. Now, they weren't the best of people. But you know, they quickly determined what it took to be an elder. I would also suggest that you need to be emotionally prepared, because you're going to have to ask the difficult questions about the spiritual life lives of others, a difficult decisions are going to have to be made, you're going to have to disagree with someone while still being kind and patient. And you're gonna have to perform your duties without being overly anxious or depressed, because you're going to take those things home with you, and it's going to keep you up at night. And you got to be able to deal with that emotionally. And again, I think it's entirely appropriate for you to interview the candidate, if I can use that word, the one who's named we're going to put forward ask him about his children. If you don't know about his children, they may be grown in a way, what's their state, talk to his wife, talk to his children. Talk us I said talk to his business associates and neighbors. I will say that there's a couple here, that before they place membership here, they came and interviewed us, the three elders.

Unknown Speaker  33:30
And they asked about our background, and our marriages, and our children. And I really appreciated that. And, you know, typically we go and interview them, when they asked to be asked to place membership, they interviewed us, which I think was totally appropriate. They didn't know anything about us, or our backgrounds. And I think similarly, it's the same applies to those names we put forward in the next coming weeks. The wife is the wife domineering Is she the one making all the decisions in the family? If so, I would say the man is not above reproach in that area, because he's not fulfilled his role as the head of the house. Or on the other hand, is she the real one that's responsible for the faithful children in their family and he had nothing to do with it, or very little. I would say he's, he's not above reproach there, as well. And I don't believe the role of elder is a husband wife team effort per se. Obviously, the husband leans on his wife for support, and may want her opinion on certain things. But the scripture bears out, it is the character of the male, as as a leader in this area, obviously the wife should be supportive. He should lean on her and rely on her for her good opinions in general, but it is not a elder elder S type of situation. It is a role of the male and faithful children was not in my text. But let me just quickly say what if they do fall away later in life or how much later? That's a debatable question a judgment call. But I will say this If, if if a child leaves home, leaves your care your authority, if he leaves home home at age 18, and immediately denounces God and leaves the church, it doesn't appear to me that the Father has raised that child properly. My opinion. Now, also someone may object to some man's name being put forward on some shaky, shaky objection that doesn't real have real merit. And the person making the objection, perhaps is not not that strong of a Christian himself. Yet the man, the nominee withdraws his name because he doesn't want to upset anyone. So the congregation gives in to the weakest and perhaps loudest talking member, and then the group is deprived of a potentially strong faithful leader. That's not the way things should be. And then we kind of default to the weakest member of the group. Let's let's consider that let's it's imperative that we know what we're defending. You may be hearing some some things for the first time you may be hearing things to describe for the first time I would just ask you to study these passages again, perhaps what we've heard all our life is not entirely correct. I know I've changed my opinion on several things. When the scriptures was laid out for me more clearly. Several things in my life. Yes, of course, I may be wrong too. I will continue to study as well. That's elders. Let's talk about deacons. And I'll try to move quickly. But I don't want to not give deacons

Unknown Speaker  36:58
enough time, I will try to give them ample time. Verse eight through 13 ESV. deacons, deacons, likewise, must be dignified, not double toned, not addicted too much wine, not greedy for dishonest gain, they must hold the mystery of the faith with a clear conscience and let them also be tested. First, let them serve as deacons if they prove themselves blameless, their wives likewise must be dignified, not slanderers, but sober minded, faithful and all things. Let deacons each be the husband of one wife, managing their children and their own households Well, for those who serve well as deacons gain a good standing for themselves and also great confidence in the faith that is in Christ Jesus. As I said before, this is the only passage in the New Testament that's dedicated to the character of deacons. deacons comes from the word deoxyribose, which simply means minister, or servant, that is their role. It defines that word defines their role. One who executes the commands of another, we may have a model, or a prototype of Deacon like service in Acts chapter six, and I'm sure you're all aware of this, so I'll go through it quickly. But in in the days of the early church, church was going quickly, the helenus complained that their widows were being neglected in the daily distribution. And so and I know Kurt referred to this a couple of weeks ago. So to solve that problem, the 12 summon the disciples and said, it's not right that we're doing this, we need to select some and he asked the group to select some men to, to say to this duty, but he said that's not right. We should give up preaching the Word of God to serve tables, that word comes from the word. The Greek word Dr connotes or to the word from which we get Deacon. But a physical task was been neglected the apostles needed to attend to spiritual matters. And so men have good reputation. Men of good repute or reputation were chosen, and they were appointed to the duty the Knesset, it was a necessary task, it was necessary and it required good and reputable men to take care of it. Not just anyone, but good, reputable men. And so the apostles could devote themselves to the spiritual matters. So if this is a model we can follow. And it seems like it is deacons that we appoint, can relieve the elders of a local church have the more physical duty so they can give more focus to the spiritual. And it should be noted here, and I'm preaching to myself. It should be noted here that the chosen here seem to have been given authority over this task to carry it out on their own, while still being under the general guidance of the apostles and elders need to remember that deacons are capable men very capable, many having leadership roles in the business world very capable of handling their tasks without elders looking over their shoulder every step of the way, I get that. And I need to be reminded of that of that from time to time. But so they chose Steven and Phillip and Procore, US and Nakamura, and Timon, and harmonists and Nicolas. They chose them from the group very capable men to serve in this important work seems to be a model for what deacons do today in the church. It does say deacons, likewise must be dignified and so on. The characteristics of the deacon will be similar to the overseer, some of them exactly the same. Dignified meaning respectable honorable, with a certain serious demeanor, or reverence. You can tell when someone has a serious outlook on life, versus those who are just happy go lucky and not really concerned. But the deacon must consider his duties seriously. He's not double tongue, he's not two faced, he's sincere, not deceitful.

Unknown Speaker  41:12
He is not addicted to much wine. And remember, with the elder he, the elder should not be a drunkard. This is a little bit different, not given to excessive drinking, that says, are not addicted to much wine. So again, drink does not have a hold on him, so that he can carry out his work responsibly and have the respect of those that he serves. And I would say, those addictions to other chemicals as well might fall under this heading. He is not greedy for dishonest gain. And often, deacons have to handle money in different ways. So he must be a man who is trusted, and must be a man that where money does not tempt, he is not tempted to use the church's money for his own purposes, and he must have the full confidence of the group. And this describes also his everyday work is his work ethic. He's an honest person, and people trust him. This next phrase is probably the most interesting one in the whole paragraph, he must hold the the mystery of the faith with a clear conscience. Mystery of the faith, I think simply means the revealed truths of the New Testament, the gospel that is now shared with all and he must hold it with a clear conscience without any to face sadness without hypocrisy. So in other words, the Gospel has a deep meaning for him. He believes that with his whole heart, the word of God defines his life and it gives him direction. The Bible guides him and that's evident to other people around them. interesting phrase, but let them be tested first, then let them serve as deacons if they prove themselves blameless, you have to know someone a while before you know if they're trustworthy, they have to be tested. They need to show themselves to be dependable. Remember that INEC six, three, they were reputable men, they had a good reputation, so they had been tested. The ASB says these men also must first be tested then let them serve as deacons if they are beyond reproach. There's our phrase again. Another interesting sentence, here is the next one, verse 11. Their wives likewise must be dignified, not slanderers. But sober minded. The word wives there actually just means women. And the NSB NASB reads like this. Women must likewise be dignified. So reading the previous verse, it's just talking about deacons proving themselves and then women must likewise be dignified. Now, the NET Bible or sorry, the ESV and other versions, kind of tried to clarify the clarify that by inserting the word their wives, so to make us think the deacons wives, but remember, it just says women must likewise be dignify so reading it that way. What might that mean? Well, there's been a lot of disagreement, different opinions on what Paul meant here by women. Is it all Christian women? Is it the the wives of just the deacons? Or is it in the context of elders and deacons? And so is it therefore elders, wives and elders, elders, wives and deacons wives? Does it concern both of them? And if it's deacons wives, why aren't elders wives talked about? So you see the questions and some also say that it could be the term Deaconess, as in the same sense that Phoebe was a deaconess and Romans 16 Verse one which says only means a servant of the church in Rome. So is it used in that sense? It is interesting that nothing is said of elders wives if this refers to deacons wives, I think to me the natural reading is deacons wives, because after this it talks about deacons again in verse in verse 12. So it's kind of sandwiched between in the in the description of deacons, but I could understand how it could be speaking of elders, wives and deacons wives here. If it is deacons wives that could we assume that elders, wives must at least have these characteristics as well. Again, I don't think there's any husband, wife team teaming up that's taught here, or any pastor, Pastor it type of teamwork going on here. Again, husband always depends on his wife needs her support, but it is a male role.

Unknown Speaker  46:00
But also remember that the wife is part of the parenting duo. The man doesn't do all the work, those godly children that he is supposed to be raising, she's part of that work as well. So she does have to be dignified, and not a slander, and sober minded, and so forth. So let's look at the rest of these terms. She must be dignified not a slander, but sober minded. pneus must be respectful. slanders could be defined as not a malicious gossip. You can be a gossip, just don't be all malicious about it. No, not a gospel, not a slander, we know what that means. But temperate are, are sober minded. And then finally, they must be faithful in every respect, in all things they must be believing must be trustworthy, and they must be reliable. And here we have a couple of phrases that remind us of the same description of the elders, let deacons each be the husband of one wife, managing their children and their own households well, so they have the same responsibilities similar or the same responsibility, as mentioned, for the elders, pretty much the same definition, as we've discussed, so I'm not going to make any additional comments here. But they have that that same character trait. So the family background is equally important with the deacon. For those who served well as deacons gain a good standing. Now what does he mean by that? It reminds us of when you remember when the mother of the sons of Zebedee came to Jesus, Matthew chapter 20. And they were she requested that they sit on the right hand and left hand of Christ and His Kingdom in Jesus saying, You don't know what you're talking about, are you willing to be baptized with the same baptism, I'm going to be and then the other apostles were very angry with them for for making this request. And this is what Jesus said. But Jesus called him and said, you know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and they're great ones exercise authority over them, it shall not be so among you. But whoever would be great among you must be your servant. That word servant is the Exynos. And whoever would be first among you must be your slave, even as the Son of Man came not to be served, but to serve the economics again, and to give his life as a ransom for many. That's Matthew 2025, through 28. So to have good standing is to be highly regarded by the Lord in serving others just as he did. That was his purpose. So one in good standing is the one who serves. And he would also have great confidence in the faith that is in Christ Jesus. So this knowledge gives the deacon great boldness in the faith, to act on their faith to act on their convictions. I'm almost there. The deacons perform vital services for the local group, so it can function smoothly. These duties change over time, from congregation to congregation and from culture to culture. In our particular group, there are many duties that deacons can perform to relieve the elders from those tasks and, and I've got a few examples on the screen. Some of these we are already utilized. And some of these can be combined, but these are just things that I've thought of that need to be addressed. And there's probably more we can add to the list. Building Maintenance work groups, young people studies, maintain the website, the directory, the social media, VBS, the classes, the worship, being a treasure, building, security, all these things. These are just 18 that I thought of just that You know, in about 10 minutes. Some of these we already utilized, of course, but we there are other things that need to be addressed. And we hope we can do that in the next few weeks. It's not an exhaustive list, and we're open to other suggestions, things that need to be done. We are blessed with many capable men who can perform these duties and perform them very well. deacons fulfill very necessary roles in their congregation. I know our lessons today may have prompted questions in your mind. We ask that you study them have discussions, and bring your questions to us if you're still in disagreement, or still unclear about anything that's been said today, or even from what Kurt said, or what will be said next week, with Jeremy and Conran.

Unknown Speaker  50:50
If you do have a question that you can't fully resolve about a particular man, and you're still unsure about him, you shouldn't submit his name of course, don't go against your conscience, be be have those questions fully resolved in your mind before you you submit the name. But Please carefully consider what the Scriptures say on the character of elders and deacons. Let's not be too broad in our interpret interpretation of the Scriptures and at the same time, not too narrow either. Let's do what the Scriptures say, and point men that the scriptures describe, let's be just as broad and narrow, as Scripture teaches. You may have heard some things today that you haven't heard explained quite this way before. But again, please consider them carefully. What we may have thought all our life might, you know, need to be refined just a little bit. But if you're, if you feel your your view is right, we want to, and it disagrees. With what we presented. Of course, we want to talk to you about that. Next week on the 31st, Conrad and Jeremy will present two more lessons regarding the eldership the responsibilities and work of the elders, and then congregational responsibilities to the elders. And I'm going to make an update to what we previously announced, we announced that we'd like your names submitted by the 14th of April, we're going to extend that out to the 21st of April. So that's another week, we would like you to submit those names of elders and deacons, potential elders and deacons in writing and sign it please and an emailing is fine, I would email all three of us because one of us or two of us is bound to lose it. Email all three of us and you might come in to us and verify that we received it if we don't respond. After this process, it may be that we do not appoint additional men to serve as elders or even deacons. That doesn't mean we failed. What we we have learned will help us and we will have grown by the process. By studying the topic closely and younger men will begin to learn more about what it means to be an elder or a deacon. We are very blessed to work with this group. And we're growing a number so our needs are growing as well. So we could utilize additional elders and deacons for the work here at Broadmoor, thank you for your attention. May God bless our efforts here at Broadmoor. If you're not a Christian and you need to become one tonight, this is that opportunity to make that change in your life. If you need the prayers of this congregation have that opportunity as well. Let's stand together and say
