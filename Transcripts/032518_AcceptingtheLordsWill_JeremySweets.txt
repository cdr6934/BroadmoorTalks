Good morning. Good to see everyone here today, certainly good that we can gather together to worship our God. Appreciate the worship that's been led so far appreciate Nick and the songs that he led for us thinking about God and His will. This year, we are looking at the theme of being stewards, faithful stewards. And we see that in Scripture. Now a steward is someone that is not his own master, he has to answer to another one. As we think about stewardship and about the Christian life, we realize that the Bible and the Christian faith starts with the fact it rests upon the foundation that God is, and that his character is revealed in Scripture. He exists, He is God, he is alive. He is fundamentally and completely good, and loving. his thoughts and his ways exceed our own we see that in Isaiah 55, verses eight, nine, where God says from my thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are your ways, my ways, For as the heavens are higher than the earth, so are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts. You know, it's one thing though, to acknowledge that God exists, and that God has higher ways, and it's another thing completely, to seek to do His will and all things. So this morning, I'd like to talk for just a few moments about, about accepting the Lord's will, accepting the Lord's will. We know that's not easy. When we raise our children, children know that parents have authority children know that they're supposed to do what their parents say. But it's much harder to do what they say in all circumstances. And we are children of God. And it's really not any different for us as, as adults. It's not as if we grow out of that phase where we, we, we never want our will know, as children of God, we know God is the Father, we know we're supposed to do what he would have us to do. But it's a different question of will we consistently do what God wants us to do? Will we accept His Will? Will we accept His will? When I open up the Bible, and I see the stories of David, I see an individual who was said that he was a man after God's own heart. And there's many things we could say about them, we see that he was one that humbled himself, and he sought the Lord's will throughout his life. And in doing that, we see one that that consistently accepted the Lord's will, even when it was difficult for him, even when it was not exactly what he wanted or desired. He recognized God's wisdom and His goodness, and he accepted His will. So I'd like to look at a few accounts in the life of David, as we think about the subject of accepting the Lord's will.

Jeremy Sweets  03:19
First of all, we see that David accepted the Lord's will when he discovered the truth and maybe discovered is not the right word. Let's get into this story in in First Chronicles chapter 13, and 15. Here we see that David is going to be moving the ark, and the first time that he moves the ark, as we see in First Chronicles chapter 13. It says that he asked the leaders and the people about whether this was pleasing to God, and it says an all the assembly agreed to do so for the thing was right in the eyes of the people, they agreed to move the Ark back to Jerusalem. We're going to see though as they move the ark, and they moved the ark on ox carts, that it became unsettled and as a reached out his hand to touch the ark, and he was put to death. The scripture says that David respond to that, first of all, he was angry, he was upset. Then it says that he was fearful to continue to move the ark. And so he he parked the ark at the house of Obed Edom. You'll notice in First Chronicles 15, that David seeks to move or continue what he had started. But this time instead of going to the people, the tech says that he went to the priests, and he told them to consecrate themselves. And in verse 13, he says, Because you did not carry it the first time the Lord our God broke out against us, because we did not seek Him. According to the rule. You say, David recognize that God's will was higher than his will. And he accepted the Lord's will. And he moved the Ark this time according to the instructions provided in the law. Now, we're not exactly sure why he moved it in the way that he did the first time. I'm not sure exactly what his reasoning was. So maybe he knew about the truth and, and forgotten. And so we'll have to play will loose with this idea of discovering, but when he saw his need, when he saw the truth, then he went into action, he took action. And he did today, is there any difference? When we see the truth, what do we need to do? And what is our attitude? Well, we need to accept the Lord's will in the so what do you do when you discover the truth in the scriptures? That the sexual relationship is only condoned or proper in the marriage relationship? What do you do? If you're unaware of that? And you've not been living as you should have when it comes to the sexual relationship? You accept the Lord's will? Or do you fight against it? What do you do when you discover the truth about baptism? That it is immersion in water for the forgiveness of sins? Who the for those who through faith have committed their life to God? What do you do when you discover the truth? about baptism? Are you going to accept the Lord's will? What do you do when you discover the truth about marriage, divorce and remarriage? That God intends marriage to be for life and divorce is only a lot louder for the cause of sexual immorality infidelity? What do you do when you learn that the person that you want to marry has no right to be married? And we could go on and on down the list, but what do you do when you discover the truth of God's word, it's really going to challenge our our commitment, to obey God and to serve Him and to accept his will. In Proverbs 23, and verse 23. It says, By the truth and do not sell it. That's what we need to do with the truth of God's word, we need to buy it, to seek it, to hold on to it, and do not let it go. Far too often, we want to buy the truth when it's convenient, or the price is cheap. But if it's going to cost us something in terms of our will, and giving up something that we want, we're often willing to sell it and sell it very quickly. But the tech says, Buy the truth, and do not sell it. So will we accept God's Will when when the truth is discovered? Secondly, will we accept God's Will when God doesn't grant our request? Notice in Second Samuel chapter seven, Second Samuel chapter seven,

Jeremy Sweets  07:54
we see that David desires to build a temple for the Lord. In fact, he reasons I dwell in a house of cedar, but God's House of the Temple doesn't match that. And so he says to Nathan, and talks to Nathan about this and expresses his desire to build a temple for the Lord. And Nathan immediately says, Go and do all that as well with you, the Lord is with your heart. But the very next verse in Second Samuel verse four says, but the same night the word of the Lord came to Nathan and said, Go and tell my servant David, Thus says the Lord, would you build me a house to dwell in? I've not lived in a house since the day I brought up the people of Israel from Egypt to this day, but I've been moving about in a tent from my dwelling in all places where I've moved with all the people of Israel that I speak a word with any of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to shepherd my people Israel, saying, Why have you not built me a house of cedar? Here, we see that God responds to to Nathan's to speak today. He says, I did not ask for this. I did not seek this. So David desired to do something for God. But God did not grant that request. God did not allow him to do what he wanted. So the question is for David, what is he going to do when he's confronted with this situation? Will he accept the Lord's will? Well, we do see that David accepted the Lord's will. And he accepted it. And he didn't do it in a way where he began to pout and say, Well, if I can't find I can't build the temple, then just forget about it. He didn't turn his back on God. He didn't say that. If I can't get what I want, then then I'm, I'm just going to not do anything. Now he he heartily sought to prepare the temple to be built. God said that it would be his son that would build the temple. So David put his efforts into to preparing the way for his unto build the temple, David was one that took the instruction of the Lord and changed what he was doing, and again went full steam into serving the Lord. David didn't get what he wanted. But he responded with an attitude of acceptance of what God designed. In the New Testament, we see that the apostle Paul had a desire as well. The text says that he had a thorn in the flesh. And in Second Corinthians 12, eight, nine, it says that Paul said Three times I pleaded with the Lord about this, this thorn in the flesh, that it should leave me. But he said to me, My grace is sufficient for you for power, for my power is made perfect in weakness. David didn't get what he wanted when he asked to build a temple for the Lord. Paul did not get what he wanted, when he asked for the thorn to be removed from his flesh. But both of these individuals accepted the will of the Lord and continued to serve him. What about today? How do we respond to God when we don't get what we want? The Bible says that we are to be a praying people putting our petitions or giving our petitions to God, God is more powerful than we than we are. He has all power. So we are to pray where you shall ask things. But God is not going to give us everything that we want. Just as a father doesn't give their child every thing that they want. But we see that the Father gives the child what is good for them. So today, Have you Have you prayed for a godly spouse? But that prayer has not been answered? Have you prayed from a fulfilling career with many promotions? But that Job has not come? Have you prayed for children, but yet remain childless? Have you prayed for sickness to be removed, but yet you continue to face the difficulties of health? Have you prayed that the life of a loved one would be preserved? And yet your loved one died? God doesn't always give us what we want. And so the question is, when those times arise, what are we going to do? Are we going to throw our hands up and say, if God doesn't love me?

Jeremy Sweets  12:32
Are we going to throw our hands up and accuse God of being evil or vindictive? Are we going to accept the Lord's will knowing that he is a good father? He is seeking what is best for us? Are we going to have to maybe adjust our idea of service to the Lord, I always had in my head that my wife was going to look like this and I would be God's servant in this situation. But when David was told, that's not how I want you to serve me, what did David do? He had to adjust and serve God in the way that God designed. And it may be that we have prayers today that are not answered. And we have to adjust to God's will. We can continue to pray some of these answers that I talked about may be simply not yet response from God. God may want us to have that but not yet. But in other situations, it may be a no. And so the question is, will we accept God's instruction, God's will, when we don't get what we want? You know, I think the hardest phrase to add to a prayer, we may do this quickly, but if we'll stop and think about it, the most difficult phrase to add to a prayer is what Jesus prayed in Matthew 26 and verse 39, when he asked for the cup, to pass from him to a cup of suffering, he says, but not as I will, but as you will. That's a challenge. That's difficult to understand that God in his infinite wisdom controls all things that God knows and God loves us and God cares for us. You know that that butts up against our will, though. We get so consumed with what we want. But we need to accept the Lord's will when God doesn't grant our request. Thirdly, we need to accept the Lord's will when we are confronted with sin and we see this in Second Samuel chapter 12. When we look at David, his path to his confrontation with Nathan in Second Samuel chapter 12 was really pretty Seated by a series of decisions that he had to make. David stood on his roof top and the palace would have been the highest building really in the city. And he would be able to look down and it says that when his armies were out to battle, and he was on his roof top, he looked down, and he saw a woman who was what should have been a private moment, she was bathing. And he looked down and saw her and he had a decision to make dittany. He continued, he could continue to look and lust, or he could turn away. Just incidentally, I'll add that you don't have to be a king and a palace to realize that that same decision exists today. She drive down the road and see billboards. As you open up the computer and see ads as you go into the store. In law, dusty is around and the same, it says, decision exists today. Are you going to look in lust? Are you going to turn away and practice self discipline or control, David had that decision, and he did not make the right one. And he called Bathsheba into himself. And it says that he went into her. When she became pregnant, he had another decision to make, he could admit his wrong and deal with the consequences of his sin. But that's not the decision that he made. Instead, it says that he called Uriah to come home so that he could try to cover up his sin. But when Uriah acted in a way that was honorably, because he was fighting in battle, he did not seek to go into his wife. It did not fit into David's plan, and he had another decision to make. It's almost like you see this, this train, and David's on this train, and he has many chances or opportunities to get off. But speed begins to pick up and it becomes harder and more difficult each passing time to get off the train. That train was headed for destruction for David. And so he had the choice to make, what would he do? Or he decided, if he's not going to act honorably, I will simply remove him from the equation and David commits murder, murdering the wife of Bathsheba. The husband of Bathsheba.

Jeremy Sweets  17:17
We'll get there. So David had many decisions to make and he kept making the wrong one. In chapter 12, these decisions leading to the confrontation with Nathan. Nathan tells him the story of a parable really of a rich man that that stole a poor man's land, a poor man's land. And David became enraged. Why would a rich man do that he had all the lands that he could want? Why would he take what was something that belonged to the poor man. And Nathan says, You are the man. You are the rich man that had your choice of any maiden in the land. But yet you chose to take the wife of another man, the wife that belonged to another. David, you're the one I'm talking about. And David's rage as it was directed at Clear injustice. He recognized that really, he was the one. He was the one that Nathan was talking about. He was the one that had committed this great injustice. And so David is convicted, he's convicted. Now David had choices again to make here as well. David could have denied he had done a lot of that previously. He could have made excuses for this wasn't my fault. He could have pounded. He could have gotten angry at the messenger. There's a lot of things that he could have done. But in Second Samuel 12 And verse 13, it says that he he said this, I have sinned against the Lord. Now of all the things that he could have said those things aren't recorded. There's no excuses that are made. There's no pouting or anything like that. The statement is simple and straight to the point. I have sinned against God. And David recognized his sin. And he admitted it, he humbled himself, and he owned up to the sin that he committed. Now, when David was told about the sin, the punishment that was to come toward him would be that his son would die the son that that would come from Bathsheba. And when he heard about this, the text says that he fasted and he pleaded for the life of his son. But when his child die, the servants were afraid that David would respond in a negative way. But the text says that David arose from the earth. This is Second Samuel 12 In verse 20, David arose from the earth and washed and anointed himself and changed his clothes, and he went into the house of the Lord and worshipped. Now David was confronted with his sin. So first of all, how did he accept the Lord's? Well, when it came to his sin, he owned up to his sin, and he admitted it, he confessed his sin. But furthermore, there was consequences to come from his sin, there will be the death of his child. And it's interesting to me that while the child was living, he still relied upon God's grace and mercy. And he called out to him and pleaded to him that he would save the life of his son. But when that decision was made, he did not go away angry. He did not raise his fist at God say, How dare you take from me? He did not accuse God of being evil at all. He accepted the Lord's will. And it says that he went up to the house of the Lord and worships, he recognize who God was before him. When we are confronted with sin, how do we respond? Do we accept the Lord's will and humble ourselves and seek to change that sin? Do we deal with the consequences in a way that that recognizes that God is still good? The consequences of sin are difficult and are harsh in many ways, but so is sin. Today, we need to confront our sin as well. If you've been caught in the sin of adultery, how will you respond? Will you cover and hide and and blame? Or will you own your sin? What about if you've been caught in theft? Lying, gossip, pride, pornography, cowardice. What is your attitude? Will you own your sin? Or will your pet sin become more important than the will of God? Will you accept God's will? Or will you push forward with your agenda and your will?

Jeremy Sweets  22:13
That's the question for us in Psalm 51, a psalm that's closely related according to the title to this very episode in Second Samuel 12. And we see that David says in verse 16, for you will not delight and sacrifice or I would give it, you will not be pleased with a burn offering the sacrifices of God or a broken spirits, a broken and contrite heart, O God, you will not despise. What does God want from us when we are confronted with sin? He wants a brokenness of brokenness, a confession, I have done what is shameful, and wicked, and a commitment to turn away from that relying upon God's strength, and His grace and His forgiveness. That's what God demands. Now, just contrast that with how we often respond. We often respond in pride. This couldn't have been my fault. I'm not done anything wrong. It wasn't me. It's nearly not that bad. It's a small thing. It wasn't me. I don't I don't deserve this. That's how we often respond. Will we accept the Lord's will when we are confronted with our sin? Or will we persist our own will? Fourth, will we accept the Lord's will when we face God's discipline? When we face God's discipline, in Second Samuel 24, toward the end of David's life, the text says that David wasn't incited to take a census of the people. But afterward David's conscience was pricked, and he admitted his sin, he said, and in Second Samuel 24, I have sinned greatly in what I've done. But now Oh, Lord, please take away the iniquity of Your servant for I have done very foolishly. God said to David that he had one of three punishments to choose and he allowed him to choose three years of famine, three months of three months of fleeing from his enemies or three days of pestilence. David the text says, and verse 14 chose, he chose the last one. He says, I'm in great distress, let us fall into the hands of the Lord for His mercy is great, but let me not fall into the hands of men. Later in verse 17, when David saw the angel striking the people he said, Behold, I have sinned and I've done wickedly, but the sheep what have they done? Please Let your hand be against me and against my father. spouse, David's attitude was that he would choose his sin and he would choose the one that dealt most harshly and severely coming from God. And when he saw that coming, he even said, Let this be on me and not the people do not let them bear the consequences of my sin. When David faced the choice, I find it interesting that he chose the last one, let me fall upon God. He says, For God is merciful. Now you remember, this is the same God that had a punishment earlier, that his child would die. And David then pleaded on God pleaded to God and pleaded on his mercy to save his child. And that didn't happen. And David here still recognizes and understands, despite the fact that he didn't get what he wanted with his son earlier, that didn't change God's character and who he was. God is a merciful God and he falls upon God here again, believing in His mercy. The text says that, that the angel with the death angel, his hand relented, God caused his hand to relapse. But I find it interesting to see David's attitude when he was facing difficulty and discipline from the Lord. Today, the Bible teaches that we may still face discipline and discipline from the Lord. It's difficult to know how to fit that category, discipline of the Lord. And Hebrews chapter 12, we get a sense of what's included in that anyway. And Hebrews chapter 12, go ahead and open your Bibles there and look with me in verses three through 11. Hebrews 12, three through 11.

Jeremy Sweets  27:04
That says in verse three, consider him who endured from sinners such hostility against themselves so that you may not grow weary or fainthearted in your struggle against sin, you have not yet resisted the point of shedding your blood. And have you forgotten the exhortation that addresses you as sons my son do not regard lightly the discipline of the Lord, nor be weary when reproved by him for the Lord disciplines, the one he loves and chastises every son whom he receives. It is for discipline that you have to endure. God is treating you as sons for what son is there when his father does not discipline. If you are left without discipline in which all have participated, then you are illegitimate children and not sons. Besides this, we have already had earthly fathers who disciplined us and we respected them, shall we not much more be subjected to the Father's spirits and live for they disciplined us for a short time as it seemed best to them, but He disciplines us for our good, that we may share His holiness. For the moment all discipline seems painful, rather than pleasant, but later it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness by those who have been trained by it. A few things to point out in this text, again, I don't know everything that's involved with with the discipline of Lord and how exactly that comes about. But the text says in verse three, consider him who endured from sinners such hostility, at least in part, what is involved in the discussion of the discipline of the Lord is seen in Jesus Christ, and that he endured hostility from sinners. And so we see that at the heart of this seems to be a concept of suffering, suffering or pain. And we may associate that with receiving a spanking or some kind of punishment. And so there's a small point of pain, but really, it's for the good of the child. Now,

Jeremy Sweets  29:00
I don't know if we have to bring in all the concepts of punishment and everything associated with that here. The point though, is, there will be some pain in this life, that we will suffer, there will be suffering that we will have to endure. The text says at the end in verse 11, says, For the moment, all discipline seems painful, rather than pleasant, but later it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness to those who have been trained by it. suffering, suffering for doing what is right is painful, but it is something that can train us, it can ultimately be good for us. When we face God's discipline, how are we going to respond? Well, we again, shake our fist at golf and say, Why would I have to endure this? Or we say, it's not fair. I'm doing what's right. So why am I suffering? Are you gonna look at the wealthy and say, You know what they live in sin, but they have everything they want, why that's not fair. That's not fair. We look at things in a very short term. And we make the accusation that it's not fair. God's looking at things eternally. And they are fair will be fair, because God will bring all things into account, we see that God is one that will will be true to his word, he will be just in what he does. So the question in all of these things is, will we accept the Lord's will? Or will? Or will we persist in our own will? Will we accept the Lord's will when we discover the truth? Will we accept the Lord's will when he doesn't give us what we want? Or what we've asked for? Will we accept the Lord's will when we're confronted by our own sin? And will we can accept the Lord's will when we suffer or have to face the Lord's discipline? What is our attitude going to be in all of these things? But the lesson is yours about I hope these questions are point. They cause you to think and dwell upon our great need to accept God and His will and all things. If you're here this morning, and you're not a Christian, you have an opportunity to accept his will by believing that Jesus is the Christ repenting of your sins, confessing that Jesus is the Son of God and being baptized into water for the forgiveness of your sins. That's a quick process or can be a quick process, but the implications of it is not quick. In fact, the implications of that is lifelong. That is a decision that process is the decision, a commitment for your entire life. You're committing not a small thing, but everything that you are, you're giving it to God. And that's what is needed and demanded that you would do so in humility, and acknowledgement of God and who he is. If you're here this morning and you are a Christian, you're not living as you as you should. You need to continue to accept the Lord's will. It's not a point where we get to stop accepting his will. It's like, I became a Christian before I've already done that it never stops. We always have to submit before him. If there's anyone that subject to the invitation, please come as we stand and sing at this time.
