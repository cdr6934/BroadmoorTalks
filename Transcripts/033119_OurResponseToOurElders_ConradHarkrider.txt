Want to open up your Bibles to Hebrews the 13th chapter, Hebrews 13.

Conrad Harkrider  00:13
This is the final lesson in our little series here on elders and deacons. And I was asked to remind the members here that the elders are looking for your input on this process. And so if you would please submit names of those that you believe are capable of serving as elders or deacons. And we ask that you'd submit that in writing, sign with your name, or, or email from your account, but just a way to identify who's sending the information and we're going to be collecting those over the next three weeks. I want you to imagine that you are currently out of work. And you're on the internet, looking at the different job boards, you are clicking around on LinkedIn. And indeed, and you come across the following job description, job description. It says, seeking qualified applicant with 20 with 15 to 20 years of experience must have deep knowledge, practical experience, and the ability to teach others, the preferred candidate candidate should be able to settle conflicts and resolve disputes among disgruntled customers should be comfortable entertaining, strangers and other guests in their home, must be able to work nights and weekends. Any mistakes may while performing the job will be heavily scrutinized. Family members of the candidate are also subject to review. Benefits include being the first one to arrive. And the last one to leave. Compensation is optional. But in most cases, this is a unpaid position. Now, how many of you are rushing to sign up for that job? And it sounds a little silly, but many of the things that we just mentioned are the actual responsibilities of a man who serves as an elder in the Lord's church. And that makes me want to ask the question, why would anyone want to serve? Why would anyone want this job? And as I was thinking about that question, there are a number of motives that we could put forward. First of all, maybe a man is willing to take on this burden, because he wants the recognition. There is an element of pride, he wants people to view him in that way. Maybe he wants to have influence or control over a group of people. He wants his opinions, to be elevated and to be known. Maybe it's done out of guilt or obligation. Perhaps his spouse or his family or his parents think this is something that he should do. Maybe he is trying to please others, he feels like this is his duty. Or maybe he's doing it for the money, although he may not be paid churches are large organizations, they oversee a number of funds. And so maybe he wants to be at the helm of that type of organization. Of course, these are all negative motivations. But why would a godly, sincere man decide to step into the role of being a shepherd? Well, like Peter, Andrew, James, and John, a man may feel compelled. He is called to serve in a greater a greater and a higher purpose. He wants to be pleasing to God. He realizes that he has been blessed. And he wants to use those things that he has received in order to bless and help others. He's been given opportunity. He's received resources and guidance from others. And so he wants to pass that on. I believe that when a man considers all that the Lord has done for him as the Apostle Paul did, that he realizes there is an obligation to serve and to give back. But to me, the greatest motivation for a man serving as a shepherd is his concern and love for people. He is motivated. He cares for the people in the Lord's body. And for those who have not obeyed the gospel of Jesus Christ,

Conrad Harkrider  05:05
being an elder is a difficult work. It's not an easy job and those who are serving well, they are doing so because they care about the souls of men and women. And so tonight, I want us to think about our relationship as members of the Body of Christ with our elders. And when we are working under the oversight of the shepherds, do we make their job easier? Do we make their task and their burden lighter? Do we help them in this god given role? Or do we hinder the work that God has set before them? Look with me in Hebrews chapter 13, in verse 17, Hebrews 13, in verse 17, it says, Obey those who rule over you, and be submissive, for they watch out for your souls, as those who must give an account, let them do so with joy, and not with grief, for that would be unprofitable for you. The Hebrew writer lays out two different paths or courses, he says that there is one that is of joy and the other have of groaning. And it's not hard to imagine that groaning part, you have a group of people and there are conflicts, there's disagreements, there's disrespect, and then you throw into the mix people's sin and failures, and you have an environment that produces grief, and heartache. in second Corinthians chapter one, Paul makes reference to the painful visit that he had to make to the church at Corinth. And that's how some churches operate today. It is painful to work among them. But that is not God's intent, his design his desire for his people. In First Timothy chapter three and verse one, Paul says that being an overseer is a noble task, the New American Standard says that this is a fine work. And that is, that is the Lord's will that this work would be something that is a joy, a blessing. Notice that in Hebrews 13 And verse 17, that when we respond to our elders, and follow their guidance and direction,

Conrad Harkrider  07:33
it is a benefit to us, he uses the negative here, he says, if we don't follow them, if there is no advantage, we actually hurt ourselves harm ourselves in that process. So tonight, I want to think about our response to our elders, and how we impact the work that they do here in the congregation. So first of all, notice from Hebrews 13 And verse 17, we need to obey and submit to our leaders. He says obey those who rule over you be in submission to them, it seems a little odd to think about obeying someone who's not God or not your parents. But in reality, obedience and submission are a part of many of the relationships that we have in this world. And for any type of authority, or responsibility to exists. submission and obedience have to be a part of the relationship. We obey, we submit to the government, Romans chapter 13, there are laws that have been put in place in our society, our culture, can you imagine living in a place driving on streets where stopping at the red light is a matter of preference, there are cities in the world that operate like that, and it's very chaotic, it's difficult to get around, we submit or yield to our boss. That doesn't mean that we are somehow worshipping that person or that we blindly follow everything that they tell us to do in all circumstances, we are still responsible to obey God and to follow Him. But we can still submit to those who have a position of authority. Obedience is required when someone has been given a certain responsibility or authority. And it is a show of a show of respect, a sign of trust, it says that I understand that God has placed you in this position that he has given you this authority, and therefore I'm going to submit my will, to your to your guidance. Notice the reason or the purpose for this and in Hebrews 13. He says, Obey those who rule over you and be in submission for they watch out for your souls. They are keeping watch this is for our benefit for our safety and protection when we heed the instruction of godly men. Notice what it says in Proverbs chapter seven and verse or Proverbs chapter five and verse seven. And now oh sons listened to me this is a father or a father, father figures speaking to his sons. And he says, Do not depart from the words of my mouth, keep your way far from her and do not go near the door of her house. So the context of this is the father's giving warning about the adulterous woman. And he says not to go near the door of her house. And I can just imagine a young man objecting or saying, why does it matter? What's the big deal, it's not a sin to go past the door of someone's house. But the point is that those who are mature in the faith who have gained wisdom through years of experience, they often can see a pitfall or a danger that we ourselves are blinded to. If the shepherds are to come to us, and they say, this relationship, this situation, this job, this pursuit that you're engaging in is, is not wise, we need to it is to our benefit, and in our best interest, to give serious and careful consideration to their warnings. We also need to be willing to submit to our elders in things that are that are not spiritually related. Things like the time of the worship assemblies, or the way that the Bible classes are set up. Sometimes elders make judgments about the people who lead or teach classes or participate in the worship assembly. In first Corinthians chapter 14, verse 26, Paul says that all things should be done for the building up of the church. And so we need to be respectful and courteous in these matters. We need to obey and submit to those who are leading us. Also notice what it says in First Thessalonians chapter five. In verse 12, we ask you, brothers, to respect those who labor among you, and are over you in the Lord and admonish you and to esteem them very highly in love because of their work, be at peace among yourselves. Here we see that we are to respect and appreciate our leaders to show them honor and regard. Verse 13, says that we are to esteem them very highly, that is to think highly of them. Respect is a, it's an attitude of the heart, it has to deal with our thoughts towards them, they should be full of admiration of fondness for these people.

Conrad Harkrider  13:00
Think about the people that we revere in our culture today, the people that we have lifted up that we have venerated in our minds. This past week, I had a friend that sent me a text message. And he had gotten tickets to one of the PGA tour events. And in the in the text, he had a picture of Phil Mickelson walking past and he said that he had gotten a high five as he walked through the lane of the crowd there. And so I told him that he can never wash that hand again, maybe it'll help his golf swing. But isn't it true that those those are the types of people that we look up to somebody who can hit a ball off of a little tee into a hole in the grass, or this time of year, maybe it's a person that can shoot a ball through a basket. And those are the ones that we are looking up to, and they are receiving our praise and our admiration. But let me ask you this, are those people engaged in work that has eternal significance, and importance? They're just trying to win the game to entertain the audience. You see elders and overseers are intact, are tasked with some of the most important work and responsibilities in all the world. And the question is, do we see them in that light? Do we recognize them for that? If you were to go to another congregation to visit a friend, and you walked in and they said, I want to introduce you to one of our elders? What would be your reaction? You go up and you meet the elder, you say nice,

Conrad Harkrider  14:49
it's nice to meet you. And then that's it. We kind of move on. And I think the reason why our response is, is muted. We're not thinking to ourselves This is an incredible man, this is a person who has done so much for the Lord. I think our response is muted because we undervalue the work that these men do. This is someone who is dedicated to saving lives spiritually, to restoring broken relationships to mending spiritual wounds. They're working among the most vulnerable sheep in the flock. And they are fulfilling that mission that Christ set out 2000 years ago when he was here on this earth, to seek and save the loss to build his church. So the question is, do we appreciate that work? Do we see them as someone who has gone to great lengths to save and help and build up the body of Christ? Do we respect their position and their work? Do we value their input? The things that they say the way that they approach a situation? Do we seek their counsel and their guidance? One of the key ways that we can show appreciation for someone is in the things that we say, the way that we talk about another person? How do we talk about them to our children, to people outside of the church, when we're talking to one another? When we speak about our elders in our shepherds, is it always about well, they, they didn't want another, another one of those seven day meetings where you got to go and show up every night and I'm exhausted, or, you know, they always keep having these events on Saturdays, and we have to go up there and help with whatever task may be, when we speak about them. What is our tone? What is our attitude and our demeanor? Also, not only the things that we say about them? But what about the things that we say directly to them? Do our shepherds do our elders only hear from us when there is some type of complaint? When there is a disagreement or a problem? Or I have a suggestion or a recommendation to make? Or do they hear from us on a regular basis? Do we provide courteous and respectful feedback. When was the last time we thanked our elders, for their work for what they're doing with the bible classes for the planning that goes into the things that we do together? When was the last time we thank them for reaching out to people who are struggling, or we thank them for their consistent example of faith. You know, it's rare for our elders, our shepherds to go weeks and weeks without coming and attending services. And we rely on that consistency. And that example, these men should know that we appreciate the work that they do. And so maybe you're not comfortable going up and saying all of these things, but write them a card, or you can invite them over to your house and feed them or take them out for lunch. It's not a qualification. But believe it or not, almost all elders love to eat. And they don't turn down an opportunity to sit and visit with the members. So spend time with them and show your gratitude and build up that relationship. First Thessalonians chapter five, in verse 13, says that we are to esteem them very highly in love, in love. This is a different relationship. It's not like your boss at work where you listen because you have to and you're looking for the paycheck. This relationship should involve respect and appreciation. And ultimately, it should involve love. In Colossians chapter three and verse 14. It says, Above all these put on love which binds everything together, in perfect harmony. We need to respect and appreciate those who serve among us. Also Notice Ephesians chapter six Ephesians chapter six, and verse 18. It says, praying at all times in the spirit with all prayer and supplication to that end, keep alert with all perseverance, making supplication for all the saints, and also for me that the words may be given to me in opening my mouth boldly to proclaim the mystery of the gut of the gospel. Throughout his letters, Paul is continuously asking churches and other Christians to pray for him. And this shows us or emphasizes the need to pray for those who are served being among us, he encourages the Ephesians to pray for all believers, the saints. And they also requests prayers for the special work that he has been given to preach the Word of God and certainly elders have been given a special work. And they, we need to be lifting them up in our prayers.

Conrad Harkrider  20:21
I think a lot of us have been aware of our elders the last few weeks because we've been talking about it. And we've been presenting lessons on this topic. And hopefully, you have been mentioning the shepherds in your prayers. But this is not a an isolated thing. This should be an ongoing process or an ongoing practice, where we are thinking about the work that the elders are doing and praying for them on their behalf. In Titus, chapter one and verse 10, Paul warned that there were many in Crete who were insubordinate, who were empty talkers and deceivers, and he tells Thailand that he tells Titus, that they ultimately needed to be silenced, that he needed and those the leaders there needed to rebuke those who spoke against sound doctrine. Now, let me ask you, is that an easy thing to do? Is that a enjoyable task for a person to undertake. And so something that we can do is to pray for our elders and to let them know that we're praying on their behalf to have the courage and the boldness to stand up to those who would speak against the truth, and to let them know that we are supporting them in this way? In Matthew chapter 26, when Jesus was in the garden, before his betrayal, you remember, he tells his disciples, he took with him, Peter, James, and John. And he asked them to sit and to watch with him. And after going off by himself for a period of time to pray, he came back and he found them sleeping. And what he said to them in Matthew 26, and verse 40, he came to the disciples and found them sleeping. And he said to Peter, so could you not watch with me one hour, watch and pray that you may not enter into empty into temptation. The spirit indeed is willing, but the flesh is weak. Jesus finds himself in one of the most vulnerable moments of his life. And he asks his disciples to help him to stand watch, and to pray. Elders face times of discouragement. They feel anxious, they feel worried, there are times when they are even overwhelmed. And so the question is, are there men and women today who are willing to stand and watch, to pray with them to pray for them, so that they can be able to bear the load to support them in the darkest night, with whatever they're facing? Not only should we pray for them, but notice what James says about our relationship and prayer. In James chapter five and verse 14, it says, If anyone among you is sick, let them call for the elders of the church, and let him, let them pray over him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord. And the prayer of faith will save the one who is sick, and the Lord will raise him up. And if he has committed sins, he will be forgiven. James says that prayer should go both ways we should be comfortable and asking the elders to pray for us. There's a question about this text about whether this is physical sickness, or if it's some type of spiritual weakness, but either way, the point is the same. A person should not feel like they are isolated that they have to bear whatever burden they're carrying all alone. We should be comfortable and humble enough to reach out to our shepherds and to ask for their support and for their prayers. And we need to have the humility to be able to do that. Also, notice what Paul says, or what the Hebrew writer says, in Hebrews 13, in verse seven, he says, Remember your leaders, those who spoke to you the Word of God Consider the outcome of their way of life and imitate their faith. We need to imitate the example

Conrad Harkrider  24:39
of our shepherds and elders. We need to follow those who are following Christ. They have set an example for us that is worthy of our invitation. You know, one of the greatest blessings of having elders in a local congregation. In is that we have these living, breathing examples of what it means to follow Christ. Sometimes when we read the scriptures and we we read things about being poor and spirits and hungering and thirsting after righteousness, and you think, Well, what does that actually mean? But in our elders, we find real examples. It doesn't mean that these men are perfect, but they show us in very practical ways, how we should walk in this world. And so we see their passion for those who are lost their diligence in studying and teaching God's word, their compassion for all the members of the Body of Christ, not just those that they are closest to or that are similar to them. We watch how they extend themselves, how they show hospitality, how they're willing to welcome people into their homes and their lives. And we see how they are moved with emotion when someone is restored, or when a person gives or devotes themselves to Christ. And we see that genuine concern and love for others. Our shepherds also give us an example of a husband who is devoted to his wife, not just someone who's been married for a very long time, but someone who honors and cherishes and loves their spouse, we look for them, we look to them to see what it means to serve God. In the midst of real life, when people get sick, when there's disappointment, when there's a setback or discouragement or a death in the family, these men have shown that we must keep going, we must keep serving, We don't turn our backs on God and we refuse to deny the Lord who saved us in Acts chapter four. After Peter and John were arrested, and threatened for preaching about Christ, they had been released from the council and they came back to the disciples, and they all raise their voices up in prayer and Acts chapter four and verse 31. It says, And when they had prayed, the place in which they were gathered together, was shaken. And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and continued to speak the word of God with boldness, because of the faith and the courage of these men, just a couple of men who are willing to stand before the highest Council in the land. Look what it produced in the congregation, in the in the hearts of the disciples, they were all filled with boldness. There is these men, our elders, our leaders, and their wives have spent years developing a faith and growing and maturing in their walk with the Lord and their example is worth following. And finally, we serve those among us. Because as we serve those among us we need to refresh their spirit. That's what it says here in First Corinthians chapter 16. Paul says be subject to such as these, and to every fellow worker and labor. I rejoice at the company of Stephanus unfortunate as an A K A kiss, because they have made up for your absence, for they refreshed my spirit as well as yours, give recognition to such people in whatever way we can. We need to seek to support and encourage our elders and our deacons and their families. They need our

Conrad Harkrider  28:50
they need our input, they need our feedback. And we are when we are working together, we should seek to build them up to hold them up and to refresh their spirits. In about a month. The city of Nashville is going to host the St. Jude's Rock and Roll Marathon and half marathon. About 30,000 People run in the race that closed down downtown for half a Saturday. And in order to pull off and to make something like that happen, there are literally 1000s of volunteers that come to help on the day of the race. And one of the most critical positions in all of the race are those who are working at the hydration stations. They are set up along the course. And their job is to keep the cups full of water and Gatorade. hundreds if not 1000s of cups so that as the runners pass by they can grab them and and refuel. Now if you've ever tried to if you ever watched somebody Try to take a drink of water while they're jogging. It's about 50% in the mouth and the other 50% on the shirt, but it is a critical function. Without them, these runners wouldn't be able to continue on, they wouldn't be able to run the race with endurance. And the parallel is God uses people like us to refresh the hearts of those who are diligently serving Him. When you offer words of praise, when you offer things of positive feedback, when you show Thanksgiving and appreciation and support, you are in a sense, like that cool, refreshing water to their spirit, and you help them to be able to run this race, with endurance and with patience to do the work that God has said before the May God bless us with wisdom and grace as we consider appointing men to serve in these most important roles, to work and labor among us, and in all things. May God the Father, may the Lord Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit, be given glory. We're going to close with an invitation if there's something that we can do to help you in your walk with Christ or if you want to submit your life to the Lord, you can do that tonight. Please come down to the front as we stand in seeing
