Good morning. Good to see everyone here today, and certainly good that we can come here and worship God appreciate the fact that I can do that with you. The congregation here is in a process of looking at whether we would add men as elders and deacons. And so as we go through that process, we're delivering some sermons on the topic. Mike and Norm spoke on the qualifications of elders and deacons from First Timothy three and Titus one last week, and this morning, I'd like to talk to you about the work of elders and deacons. I'll mention that, for the most part, I will be talking about elders, but I would like to start with a brief word about deacons and their work. Deacon comes from the Greek word, the aka nos, and it means simply minister, or servant. So that's a general word, and really all Christians are to be ministers or servants. But this is used in a special sense to relate to the office there. And this Office Office requires that there be certain qualities spelled out in First Timothy chapter three, verses eight through 13. And they also perform a certain work for the church. As we look at this word that's really not found a whole lot of times in the New Testament. In fact, we see reference to it in first Timothy chapter three, talking about the qualities that a deacon must have. We also see it in Philippians chapter one and verse one. There, it says that Paul writes to the saints at Philippi, including the overseers and deacons. And so as we consider the saints at a church that would include their deacons, there also may be a possible reference to that in first Corinthians chapter 12, where it says that God has appointed and as it lists some things there, one of those is helps or helping. And so we might see that with deacons. So what are deacons to do? Well, it's not spelled out in Greek great detail, I think that's probably for a reason. deacons are to serve. We see this in Acts chapter six. And even though the word for Deacon is not used there, the verb form for deacons use there that is to serve. So these were men that served or they waited on tables. And they did this in order to meet a need. So as we think about deacons, and what they do, they are men that perform works of service, and Acts chapter six, if we're to use that as an understanding of what maybe a deacon would do, we see that the deacon, or those that served, they waited on tables, they met a need, they were assigned a task to do and they did it. And that they they did this because it says that the apostles were able to focus on preaching of the Word. And so as the deacons served, and allowed really the church to fulfill its mission there and preaching the gospel. And so the gospel was not put aside in order to simply serve here, but neither was serving put aside. And so the deacons these, I keep saying deacons, you understand how I'm using that these men were chosen in order to serve in order to meet the need. Now, as we think about today, there are many things that need to be done besides preaching of the Word. And so deacons today would be able to serve, and they might do that in many different capacities. And I know again, Norm talked about some of this, I'll not go into too much detail there. deacons are those that serve and they do that as, as we see in in, in the scriptures. Okay, so that's basically what I wanted to say on deacons. Let's look at elders and their work.

Jeremy Sweets  04:01
First of all, let's talk about the fact that is the Office of Elder, just as with Deacon elder is really a generic term and simply refers to an older man. But when we look at scriptures, we see that it is used in a very specific sense, or to talk about what we might call as an Office of Elder. In First Timothy three and verse one says The saying is trustworthy. If anyone aspires to the Office of overseer, he desires a noble task, a noble task. This first of all, is an office to be considered. It is a recognized position that a man would hold for for a period of time. And so it's not just a generic older man, but this is a specific office. And while the individual that would hold this often must be exemplary in his character and behavior, it is not merely a position of honor, but rather it is a work to be done. Notice the passage here in First Timothy one, three and verse one says, He desires a noble task, the work of an elder, it's important to understand score that word work, it is a work to be done. It is a work to be done. And so we see that that is really what we're talking about here. Not only that, but it says that if anyone aspires to the Office of overseer, one that would serve as an elder must want to be an elder, and not in the sense of someone might sign up to be honored, or something like that. But rather, this is a work that needs to be done. And so an elder must be one that wants to do the work and desires to do the work. The word here in Greek originally meant something like to stretch out or to reach out for, when we find that word used a couple of different times in the New Testament, one in First Timothy chapter six, when it talks about those might fall into danger that crave or reach out or desire money. It's also used in Hebrews chapter four for those that would desire a better heavenly country. And so the idea in this word is to desire or to reach out for to strive. Again, let me underscore that this idea of striving is not for personal honor. But the reason a man must want to be an elder and desire to be an elder is because it is a difficult work to do. It is something that is often a thankless job. And so a man must want to do this, it should not be thrust upon him, he should not be compelled in such a way that he doesn't want to do it. Peter adds this about elders saying that they should exercise oversight, not under compulsion, but willingly in First Peter, chapter five and verse two. So the desire does not sprang from a prideful yearning for honor. But it's really needed in light of how difficult the work is, as a Christian must count the cost before becoming a Christian, I think the same thing is true about elders, they must count the cost. And it's something they must willingly the sign that they are going to take on that work, or that task. Yes, being an elder is a work to be done.

Jeremy Sweets  07:35
Not only that, but we also see that the elders have qualities. And I'm not going to go into detail certainly about this, because it's been covered in previous lessons. But I do want to add some thoughts, particularly as it relates to their work. So why were these qualities chosen? Well, in First Timothy chapter three, and I'm going to use that as a basis, there's really four categories of, of must haves are things that someone, an elder must meet. And the first one is found in verses two through three must be above reproach in his behavior. And there are several other things that are listed there. You might think about Noah as being a man that was blameless in his generation. And so that doesn't refer to one item. He was blameless in his speech, but really is overall character there. And so he must be above reproach, and it's a observable behavior. And there are several items that are listed there, and several items that are needed of any man that would serve as an elder, we see Second of all, that he must have a demonstration or he must show a good family life. And so he must be a one woman man, he must be one that raises his children to be believers and manages his household. Well, we also see in verse six, that this man is not to be a new convert. He is one that has displayed the qualities that we see in First Timothy chapter three, on a regular consistent basis. And so he has grown in his faith, and he has displayed these types of qualities. Not only that, but in verses in verse seven, we see that the man is to have this observable quality of life from outsiders as well. And so by that we see that he is a man of integrity, he doesn't act the way he's supposed to inside the church and then outside he acts a different way. Now, he acts the same way in a godly manner. And so we see that these these qualities are mentioned here in First Timothy chapter three. So why am I talking about this when Norman LaCorte address this? Well, let me just I had a few reflections on this. You know, we turn these in different ways. Sometimes we talk about requirements. We've used word qualifications. I've said qualities, you might think of characteristics. Really none of those descriptions of what are there are in the texts. That's just our way of summarizing that. We could simply describe them as must haves. Often it says an elder must have or must be, in some ways, these descriptions really don't matter. Although they may slightly affect how we view what's taking place to. Some people don't like the word qualification, or let me just tell you why that is. Because some people see that is, is conveying a checklist mentality, a yes or no. And really, what we find here in this list is something different than that. For example, we might have qualifications where it's either a yes or no objective thing when it comes to jobs. Today, you might think about the President of the United States, he has to be 35 years old, he must be a natural born resident. Now, that's either true or its false. You're either 35 And we have ways to calculate or you're not. You're either natural born or you're not. You might think about someone trying to get into the police academy, you have to run a seven minute mile. I don't know what the exact standard is there. But say you have to run a seven minute mile. Well, you can either do that or you can't. And I'm sure that has to be demonstrated in order to accomplish that. But these are not really yes, no checkmarks. These are not objective criteria, as if he has to meet this number of items. But rather, these are qualities. These are characteristics that we often see in the man. And so in some ways, these are subjective, not as far as what's they're saying, we get to pick and choose what the list should be. But if we think about a man containing a spectrum, they're of this quality, there may be some discussion, if you think about the spectrum, maybe able to teach, we'll take that as an example. On this side, there's someone that clearly cannot teach. On this side of the spectrum. There's someone that's a seasoned teacher that everyone knows and respects and he clearly understands the Bible. Now, in that spectrum, there may be some subjectivity as far as where this man falls, do you understand?

Jeremy Sweets  12:30
What I'm saying was that it's not a yes, no item, each item is needed. But there may be some quality there that we're discussing. Furthermore, let me suggest that these items are not arbitrary. They describe the type of person that should be an elder, and I believe they directly relate to the work, which is really the reason that I'm bringing this up. These items relate to a person's character, I believe, I believe Mike, was right, as he mentioned that character. Now that doesn't render each of these items less meaningful or meaningless. But rather, I believe it renders each item more meaningful. Let me describe, explain what I mean by that. Some people would say this describes a character. So let's put the list aside and say, all you need to have is a good character. While you might not meet every one of these items, but he has a good character. And I don't think that's what the text is teaching. And as we look at this, he needs to have a good character. But really, each one of those relates to his character. And so these are qualities, these are given for a reason each item is needed. And each item relates to this person's overall Christian walk, overall Christian walk. So the place where this comes most into play really is when it comes to the family. Life that's mentioned there in verses four and five. Being a husband and father, I believe is not enough. It's not enough to simply have a marriage license or to father children. But the idea is that you would do that well, in First Timothy three and five, it uses this language for someone does not know how to manage his own household, how will he care for God's Church? And so the point is, is that he would demonstrate godly, godly life in, in being a husband, and in being the father may notice a few things when it comes to being a husband and father. And Ephesians five and verse 25. It says, Husbands, love your wife, as Christ loved the church and gave Himself up for her husband's must be sacrificial in their love for their well wives, they are to lead but not with an iron fist, not to get what they want, but in order to serve, and they do that a great sacrifice to themselves. Now, being a one woman, man, there being one flesh with your wife, I think carries on this idea of self sacrifice, of love. And why is that important for an elder, that's how he is going to have to serve the congregation. That is the manner or the way in which he must serve. And I think he does that as he manages his household so that he can manage their the church. And First Peter chapter three and verse seven, husbands live with your wives and an under standing way. That's relationship that husbands and wives, that is a training for really the kind of work that an elder will need to do an elder we need to live in an understanding way with Christians that are there, instead of barking orders and getting their way and I'm right, I'm more experienced no, there's going to have to be a listening. They'll have to be understanding of where other people are coming from, you're going to have to understand personalities and how people work and what might be the best way to address someone. And so those things are needed. In Ephesians, six and verse four, a father is to bring up his children in the nurture and admonition of the Lord, patiently teaching, patiently guiding, not provoking them to wrath not coming down, but rather with gentleness bringing them up. Sometimes that also requires a firmness, but you see that they are bringing their children up. Now, why is that important? Shepherd shepherds are going to be fatherly figures for the congregation working in much the same way in that bringing up that nurturing role. And so as we

Jeremy Sweets  17:01
look at these, all of these qualities or traits, I believe they relate to the work that has to be done. And as a man grows in his relationship, as a husband, and father, those are the same traits that are needed for godly elders. So the qualities I should have showed this sooner relate to the work, and the work help define the qualities that are needed. And that relates to the work, I think those two things go hand in hand. Okay, so often, when we talk about the work, we look at these descriptions of the office, and there are several descriptions that are here that are here. These descriptions of the office, I believe, relate to the work that is to be done. And that is this office does not have a singular title. You know, I haven't seen this and I don't think it's appropriate, you don't write your name. And, you know, put your title as this office after it's not an honorary kind of thing. But rather, these are descriptions of the work that has to be done, and so they often overlap. In that regard. We also see that these different descriptions help us understand that there are different words that are used to describe the same office. I know in the religious world, some people have split apart these descriptions to say they are different offices, but in the scriptures, I believe it we see that it describes the same office, for example, in Acts chapter 20 And verse 17. It says that Paul set emphasis and called the elders of the church. And as he was talking to the elders, the text says that he says in verse 28, pay careful attention to yourselves and to all the flock among the which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers. These elders are overseers who will also have a flock. That's Shepherd imagery. And so we see that this is the same person might see this same thing in First Peter chapter five. In verse one, Peter there exerts the man as a fellow elder and instructs the man to shepherd the church of God and to exercise oversight or be an overseer. So all of these descriptions relate to the same office. Okay? Does that make sense? So as we look at these descriptions, one of these is elder an elder this term is used 18 times when referring to the office hear again, there is a more generic word as well 10 times and x and eight times in the remaining parts of the New Testament in the the pitch lobes. And so as we look at this, this refers to, of course, an older man, an older man. And often with an older man, what should come we see from Proverbs is wisdom. But it also carries with it the imagery of elders. If you might think through scripture you find the elders of a city are the elders of the tribe. These were patriarchs in a sense, men that were leading their families and the groups of people that were there, you might notice that sometimes elders came to the gates of the city. You see that in Proverbs chapter 31. And so these were men that were leaders there of their family, providing direction and wisdom for the group. This word elder and the Greek word is pres bitter is one description of the work to be done. Another description is overseer, overseer. The word overseers use five times in the New Testament and majority of those are in those list of qualities in First Timothy three, and also Titus one.

Jeremy Sweets  21:15
It's mentioned in Acts 20, in verse 28, which we just saw, and also in Philippians, one and verse one, which we also referenced earlier. And so those are the references to overseer that we find in the New Testament. This Greek word Episcopal simply means a guardian, an overseer, or a supervisor. And so elders are tasked with watching over they over see the flock the congregation that is there. Another word for Overseer and I could have listed the suffering. Kurt did a lesson on this actually last year talking about elders as being stewards. And Titus chapter one and verse seven. It says, For an overseer, as God's steward must be above reproach. And so steward is another word, it's found here in this single case, but really, that relates to overseer, doesn't it? A steward is an overseer in which he doesn't own what he's overseen. And that's true, isn't it for elders, they are watching over souls and looking out for the Church of God, and who does the church belong to God, and so they are stewards, performing a task as servants as servants. We also see, shepherd or pastor mentioned. And this really is only used one time, when we're referring to the office and Ephesians chapter four and verse 11. There it talks about God gave the church and it lists the apostles and prophets, evangelists, and it says, pastors and teachers, and you might see shepherds and teachers. So that's the only time that I found that this was mentioned. Now, there are a couple other metaphors that are used for, for shepherding, for example, in Acts 20, verse 28, the flock that is there, First Peter, chapter five, he says, shepherd the church, and so he's directing the elders there to shepherd. So all of these descriptions are in the text, and they relate to the work. Sometimes we use these as the way that we talk about what's to be done, but I've kind of separated the list of the work to be done into another list. But they all relate to those terms that we just looked at. Okay. So what do elders do? Well, that's what I'd like to address. Just as with deacons, it's not highly detailed the needs of the group may fit, but I think we have broad strokes and a general picture of what elders are to do. So what are they to do? Well, first, I would suggest that they rule or lead rule or lead. Hebrews 13 talks about leaders three different times. And it says in verse seven, to remember your leaders in verse 17, to obey your leaders, and in verse 24, to greet all your leaders. We also see in First Timothy five in verse 17, it says, And let the elders who rule well be considered worthy of double honor. And so elders are those that rule or lead. Now we often bristle at these words, don't we? We don't feel comfortable sometimes with what's described there because we fear maybe tyranny or abuses and maybe we've heard of those things, and overstepping of authority, but we have to keep in mind Find that elders are to rule elite rule or lead in a very specific way. Scripture forbids this type of tyrannical leadership. In first Peter five and verse three, it says not domineering over over those in your charge, but being examples to the flock. Elders are not to rule with a strong arm or a strong hand. Elders are not what we might think of as modern day CEOs who rule over a company. And sometimes we might think about those that sit in their office away from things and they pass down decisions and say this is the way it's going to be. That's not what an elder is. That's not what an elder does. That's not how they rule or Li, but rather, as we look at First Peter five and verse three, not domineering, but being examples to the flock, elders lead, first of all, by their example. They lead they rule first

Jeremy Sweets  26:05
by their example. And second, I would suggest they lay lead and their service of others. We're not talking about ruling or leading with an iron fist, someone that gets their way, just as with husbands that lead there to do that in a sacrificial way. So it is with elders. These are servant leaders, these are men that lead by serving and that's exactly what the Scriptures teach about the manner of their service. They're not to lead by domineering, by threatening by strong arming, by getting their way by enacting their will, by bumping their chests and saying, I'm an elder. That's not the way that they are to Lee. In fact, we see that their greatest impact comes from the lives that they live, they don't have the leverage of somebody that maybe a company says, I can fire you, if you don't do this. They don't have the same concerns as that man that's trying to get meet the bottom line. We don't have that here as the church, our goal was for all of us, as many of us to get to heaven, and bring as many other people with us as we possibly can. There, their greatest impact comes from their lives. So these are men that you should want to listen to. These are men that you want to listen to, because of the respected character and their lives. These men are wise, prayerful men, when they speak their words, bear weight. You see why it's so vital. It's so vital that as we select these men, that these are men that are broadly supported. Because the way that they lead is not through strong arming, they've got the position. Now they can do what they want. That's not the picture. But they will lead by teaching and their example. And so the congregation must want to listen to these men because of who they are, and the wisdom that they offer. Only choose a man that you have full confidence in. And you would be willing to submit to fathers will often give their children advice when child says that's not what I want to do. I don't like that I would rather go this other way. But the listen to their father, they should, who has wisdom, it may be that an elder would make a suggestion, or would have advice for you that you would say I don't want to listen to that. That's not the way I want to do it. But we need to listen to them. Why because of their wisdom, because of the respected character. And they demonstrated that before the congregation and outside and by not being a new convert, but continuing in the face. You see the point I'm trying to make of how they leave, and why it's so vital and important that we choose men that are meeting these qualities, they have these qualities, their lives, bear weight, their words, bear weight, and that is how they will lead over the congregation. Second of all, they watch over souls Hebrews 13 And verse seven. This function really recalls for our mind that overseer, well, this tells us what they are overseeing. They are not necessarily overseeing the, the building. They're not overseeing the finances. They're not overseeing and we could go through a list of number items. Now, they may have some input on those things. We may listen to their wisdom in that but that's not their primary task. If that is not their primary goal, they're not glorified businessmen. But they watch over souls, their primary concern is with the souls of people and their spiritual welfare. Hebrews 13 And verse seven simply uses that phrase to watch over their souls. So as all Christians, elders must focus on others, their service should come from a love and concern for others, not through selfish interests. Peter says that the work is not for shameful gain. And it's not to be carried in that out that way, but rather eagerly. It's a difficult work. But it's to be accomplished because of the good that has been done. Not for the personal gain, someone might get. Elders must seek to do what is ultimately best for a person's soul.

Jeremy Sweets  30:58
Not necessarily what's popular. Now, they may do something and that person doesn't think it's popular, the congregation may think it's popular, not popular. But popularity is not the goal of elders, but rather, the spiritual welfare of each and every person in the flock. So elders watch over souls watch over souls. That may also help you with some idea of the distinction between deacons remember that deacons met to the physical needs of the group. And that enabled the apostles there to, to preach the Word. And so we might see some distinction there, although I understand many of those things overlap as we seek to help one another. Not only that, but we see the language of caring for the Church of God. And we actually see this phrase two times. First of all, in Acts, chapter 20, and verse 28. The speech translates there to shepherd there the Church of God or to watch over the flock, and it says, To care for the Church of God. So you might think about the image of a shepherd, how does the shepherd care for a sheep? Well, he protects them from wolves and from danger, he makes sure that they're fed, he makes sure that they are together and doing what they're supposed to do, he makes sure that they're safe. And so elders care for the Church of God in much the same way, keeping out danger, dangerous, those that would attack a wolves, they feed the flock they care for and show their love and concern for the flock. Elders care for the Church of God. The other picture we find in First Timothy chapter three and verse five. It says there, if someone does not know how to manage his own household, how can he manage the Church of God or God's church. So we thought about elders as being shepherds, caring for sheep, but we also see this picture of a father, a father that manages his household cares for his household. And He does that by meeting the needs of his children providing exactly what they need, by instructing them by raising them. By helping them to develop their character and grow, we see that fathers do all of these things. And I believe in particular, in that spiritual sense, elders do the same thing. They feed, they teach, they instruct, they help grow, they're looking for your growth in their care and your character. And so they care for the Church of God. Notice also that they are to equip the saints equip the saints, and Ephesians chapter four and verse 11.

Jeremy Sweets  33:54
There it says, And he gave the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, the shepherds and teachers, to equip the saints, for the work of ministry, for the building up of the Body of Christ, until we all attain to the unity of the faith, or the knowledge of the Son of God, to mature manhood, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ. The church is a true blessing, because God has given us the church. And so it can be a place where we grow together. And I've often used that language there of, of the church. But here the text says that the that God has given the church, these men so that they can help them grow, and their teaching so that they can help them grow. Now the church can grow and be equipped from certainly the apostles from the evangelist. But the last one in that list is pastors and teachers and I think that refers to that same group. Those are pastors and teachers. same person. They are those that God has given to the church as a blessing. And Why has God given the church elders? Well, to equip the saints, so that we can all each and every one be equipped to do the work that we need to do as Christians to build up or encourage the church elders will be encouragers and need to be encouragers, encouraging us to follow after God's work, and also for growth. So that we can grow into maturity to we all attain to the unity of the faith and the knowledge of the Son of God, to mature manhood, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ. Elders are concerned with our growth. They're concerned with helping us be built up. They're concerned with our spiritual lives and whether we're growing or we're not. That's why God has given the church elders. Elders are not the sole workers in the church. In fact, this passage suggests otherwise, this passage, and particularly as you get to the end of verse 16, it says, they are to help facilitate or to promote the working of everybody. They're not the sole workers, they are ones that want everyone to work and everyone to grow. We also see that elders are those that don't really hold on to their job in a possessive way. When you think about a employment, there are some people that they have to hold on to their skill set. But they may have a certain knowledge that they don't want to tell anybody else, because that's where they're valuable. But that's not the way it is for elders, elders, are working with every Christian to grow. And in a sense, they're actually training their replacements, aren't they? Now they want every one to grow. But some of those Christians may be the next group of elders. And so elders are training them, helping them grow, helping them develop so that they can be elders. And so we see that they're not holding on and saying, This is my position. But they're seeking the growth of each and every one of us. And elders need to keep that in mind. We also see that elders teach, instruct and admonish, this function is really mentioned more than any other one. And in fact, you might say that everything that we've looked at before, is kind of consumed in this idea of teaching, they rule or lead through their teaching, they watch over souls. And they do that with their teaching. They care for the Church of God. And they do that with their teaching, they equip the saints. And they do that with their teaching. Many times teaching and elders go hand in hand. In First Timothy chapter three, in verse two, it says that they, the men must be able to teach.

Jeremy Sweets  38:06
And that may be in a public way, that's often the way that we meet together. And so that's efficient, isn't it? I can talk to more than one. But often, when you think about a father, teaching his child, it's in more private setting, and talking and saying, looking at their behavior and saying, This is what you need to do. And so that that whole process is a teaching process. Elders need to be able to do that. They need to be able to work with people so that they can grow. And Ephesians four in verse 11, there the passage we already looked at it, it says, pastors and teachers, there's been some debate whether that's a separate group, or whether it's talking about the same person, I believe there's talking about the same person. Elders are teachers, their elders and teachers or pastors and teachers. Elders are necessarily teachers. In First Timothy Five, Verse 17, says, Let the elders who rule well be considered worthy of double honor, especially those who labor and preaching and teaching. Elders are those that teach that teach. You also see passage in let's see, I got it on the backside and Titus one in verse nine, there is a talks about the qualities that says that he must hold firm to the trustworthy word as taught, so that he may be able to give instruction and sound doctrine and also to refute those who contradict it. You see the twofold idea there of teaching, they are to instruct in sound doctrine, tell those, especially of the church, what is right, teach them in true, but that will also involve a component of refuting those who contradict refuting those that deny the gospel that teach false doctrine that that promote doctrines that are harmful. And so they will have to also do that as well. We also see in Acts 21, verses 28 through 32. Paul commends the elders to the word there, so that they can protect the flock from the dangerous wolves who would twist twist the Scriptures. And so that relates to that Titus one passes that we looked at. He says, I encourage you in the the word that is able to build up for edify. So what do elders do? Well, they do a lot. They watch over our souls, they rule or lead, they care for the church, they equip the saints. And largely They do this through their teaching through their example. And through their service. It's a big responsibility. And so I'm sure that we're taking this process prayerfully not lightly say, Well, maybe he'd be okay. You know, it demands our care that goes into this process. And so I hope that we are all doing that, and I'm sure that we are in first Peter chapter two, and verses 24 and 25. There it says, He Himself bore our sins in his body on the tree, that we might die to sin and live to righteousness, by His wounds you have been healed, for you are straying like sheep, but have now returned to the Shepherd and overseer of your souls. Cry, Christ is our ultimate Shepherd and overseer. And so let me let me not give advice. But let me commend our current elders, Norm Kurtz, Mike, to use Christ as your model. let me commend any men here that might be considered that you would use Christ as your model in your work and in your service. Really, that's true for all of us as Christians, isn't it? Christ is our model, Christ is the one that we must look to. Christ is not only our model, and how to live our lives, but this passage also points to the fact that He gave His life for us, so that we might die to sin and live to righteousness. Christ is our Savior, and we must all look to Him. That's my lesson. I understand. I went a little bit over where we were what we normally do. But let me just emphasize, this is an important process. Let me say that I'm open to talking about anything that I've discussed here. I also have my notes available, just as Nora mentioned that if you would like those and couldn't get everything down,

this is important process. So let us think about it, pray about it, and talk with one another in a loving and kind way striving to do what what God's Word says, it may be is that you're here this morning and you're not a Christian. You have an opportunity right now to give your life to God, believing that Jesus is the Christ repenting of your sins, confessing that Jesus is the Christ and being baptized in the water for the forgiveness of your sins. If you're here this morning, and you're a Christian, and you've not honored that lifelong commitment, you also need to make changes. There's anyone subject to this invitation. Please come as we stand and sing at this time.
