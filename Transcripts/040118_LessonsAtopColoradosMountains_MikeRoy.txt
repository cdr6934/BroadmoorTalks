It is always good to have an opportunity to come and worship and praise our God. That's what he created created us to do. And so we've come back this evening to do that very thing. We appreciate those who are visiting with us. We're here to honor God to glorify Him in everything that we do. Thank you for those songs that you lead for skill this evening, they will tie into my lesson I trust in in a number of ways. Most of you know that my wife and a couple of our kids, Jessie, and Hannah just got back from a trip to Colorado, went skiing over there, Jesse did snowboarding, I did skiing or something like that. And I had never been there. I've always skied on the East Coast and had a chance to get out there. And so we made that happen. It was a wonderful opportunity. I began to appreciate the beauty and the majesty of the mountains of Colorado, they are majestic. And it made me appreciate my guess, is a young kid growing up in the northeast, my favorite scene was John Denver. So the Colorado Rocky Mountain High, I certainly appreciated that more I understand back then that was the high was accelerated through marijuana and things like that. And I know that from years in the past, but the truth is, when you climb up on God, God's mouth and you do get high and really get high on God, he's powerful. He's awesome. He's majestic. His creation just shout his greatness to each one of us. And so it was it was a great, great time to spend together to be with our family to have Carol with us as well. And so as we were heading there, I think Monday night, I looked at the preaching schedule, that Jeremy does a great job of getting that put together. And I realized I was down for preaching Sunday night tonight. And I was going to be out of town all week. Skiing. So my kids said why not preach on your experiences in a mountain? Good idea to me. So skiing down down the mountain, I took my clipboard my notes as writing as I was going. And fortunately didn't hit anybody. But it did. Help me to think about there's some powerful lessons that we can learn, I certainly have learned in which reminded, so let's talk this evening, I've put together eight points, somewhat brief points on what to make. But some lessons that I learned a top Colorado's mountains and the whole process as well. And just let's and I want to share some things very practical and nature. So let's talk about some of those things this evening. The first passage I want to bring to your mind when Isaiah was trying to encourage the people of Judah. And one of to encourage them to persevere through their trials are going to captivity is going to be horrible. What he says is go up on a high mountain. And basically behold your God. So when you go on a high mountain, guess what you see, you see God's power, you see God's handiwork, you saw you see his wisdom, you see his strength. And so that's what Isaiah told the people of Judah. So when you go up on a mountain, or go out to the ocean, or any part of God's creation, you see the handiwork of God everywhere. And so the first point I want to mention this evening, is that God's wisdom and power are breathtaking. And being at 12,000 feet above sea level is also kind of a you lose your breath as well. We learned that, but God's wisdom has powers everywhere. And it's designed that way that when we look at God, we see His power. So the first takeaway that I got from this trip, so reminded a god is awesome. There's nobody like him. And he is worthy of all glory and praise and honor, every every creature, every flowers, we sang in these songs, testifies of His power, His kindness, his goodness. Don't forget that. And so I took a few pictures, and looking at the vastness of the mountain, because everything is covered with snow. But everywhere you looked, one of the things that impressed me about the mountains was the spaciousness of it, how wide how vast it is. Everywhere you look mountain ranges all around valleys here and there. We were eating at a restaurant when evening and looked across the road and there's a mountain. God makes the mountains Did you know that God makes those? No, they don't self generate. There's no professor who can make a mountain. There's no philosopher who can make a mountain and there's no way that they can just bring themselves into existence. God makes the mountains. Nobody else can do that. I looked up into one of the trails and just took a picture with the sun trying to poke through and peek through the clouds. But again, these majestic mountains were everywhere. And then make you stop and think about one thing God, God is the one who who made it all.

Mike Roy  04:55
And again, just looking at everywhere we look that's all we can see was God's majesty has power everywhere. So reminded me of this passage in Psalms chapter 19. And verses one through six. The text says that the heavens declare the glory of God, the sky proclaimed the work of his hands. Day after day, they pour forth Speech Night after night and reveal knowledge, they have no speech, they use no words, no sound is heard from them, yet their voice ghost out through to all the earth, their words to the ends of the world. In the heavens, God has pitched a tent for the sun is it's like a bridegroom coming out of his chamber, like a champion, rejoicing to run his course, it rises at one end of the heavens, and it makes it circuit to the other end or to the other. Nothing is deprived of a swamp. The first point, obviously, the heavens, declare the glory of God. When you look at the heavens, all you can say is this is made by God. And any honest person who, who scans the horizon, the rivers, the lakes, the mountains, the seas, and looks at that. The only rational, honest conclusion you can deduce from that is that God made that. And God did it for purpose that we will stop looking at ourselves, looking down at our feet, so to speak, and look up at the heavens, that He's big. He's bigger than his creation. That's one of the things that impressed me. As you look at the industry, just one mountain range Loveland ski area, but it's vast, everywhere you look is mountains and skies. And think about this God is bigger than his creation. That's a staggering thought to think about. If you have trials in your life difficulties, God is bigger than all that. So the heavens declare the glory of God, the sky has proclaimed the work of his hands. So when we look at the creation, that's what he sees that this is God's doing this as God's work. And it is by his design, that we would come to these conclusions. God is trying to get us to think about him, and his greatness and His power, and not be thinking about us so much. And again, the other thought that that comes to mind with these verses. So the heavens declare the glory of God, they proclaim the sky proclaim as the work of his hands, it talks about the fact that there's no species, no language, yet their voice goes to all the earth, their words to the ends of the world, and the sun is picked, depicted as a mighty strong man coming out of his tent. And, and that's the sun's rays hit every corner of the earth, it warms the slopes of Colorado, Nashville, Tennessee, Tampa, Florida, Shanghai, China, Okinawa, Japan, where I spent the few years the race in the light of God hits every single person. There's nobody that doesn't see his power, nobody, anywhere, and is nobody liked God. And so the psalmist is saying that God's power is declared through His creation, and that shouldn't and encourage us to develop greater faith in Him. So makes me think about also in Romans chapter one, what Paul said over here, that the wrath of God has been revealed from heaven against all the godlessness and wickedness of people who suppress the truth in their wickedness, since what may be known about God is plain to them, because God has made it plain to them. So Paul's telling us a god has plainly displayed his power, his mind his kindness to all people. It's plain, it's not like, well, not really sure how this river came about, or this mountain at 14,000 feet, how that came into existence. God made it so plain that nobody can question that not with an honest heart. So God made it plain to them. Verse 20, says, For since the creation of the world, God's invisible qualities have been clearly seen, just skip that parenthetical statement for a second, since the creation of the world, God's invisible qualities, or have been clearly seen, what are those qualities, His eternal power and divine nature, when you look at God's creation, you see an eternal God. There isn't any other explanation for the existence of this world. And then he says that these things are understood from what has been made. So God made the world in such a way that we can look at that and understand that he is the divine designer and architect and engineer of the universe. And it should cause us to look to Him and trust Him. And so the conclusion Paul makes it so that people are without excuse. There's no excuse by somebody will deny the power of God, the existence of God. It can't be done. Not honestly.

Mike Roy  09:34
God made it clear. There is no person on earth and say, I didn't know about you, God. It's a lie. It's a lie. So that's the thing that really got my attention. As I scan the horizon, the spacious skies the majesty of God the song that we sing as kids growing up are beautiful for spacious skies For amber waves of grain For purple mountains majesty Above the fruited plains, this is God doing this. So that's the first point I want to suggest. So God's wisdom and power. Really just take your breath away. Secondly, once again, these are some observations that I learned from our time and a mountain and they effort to get there. And then there's the idea that prioritizing family time is essential for all of us. It really is essential. We all live very busy lives. Are you busy in your life? I'm busy my life. We all get tons of things to do work and all kinds of activities. You know, as I thought, as we get older, that thinks is supposed to slow down, but they're not slowing down. They seem to accelerate. But no matter how old or young we might be, we must make time for our family. We have to do that. And I want to say this getting away from work. For especially those of us who are men can be an enormous challenge because we are you I'm too busy. I can't get there. I've got to get in fact, I'm the busiest I've ever been. And somebody has to pay the bills. And so it's very, we rationalized all that stuff. I just can't do it. In fact, really, if it wasn't for my wife, and our kids, especially Jesse through the years say, Hey, Dad, Sunday night, let's go skin tomorrow morning. No, wait a minute, I've got customers than I do emails. And this is in the years past. I've sent emails and text messages and rescheduled something. But the point I'm making is, is hard to get away from busy lifestyle and and spend time with family didn't have to be vacation but doing things together. And the truth of the matter is, your work is going to be there when you get back of the issue that you're dealing with it will still be there. And what I have found gifts to my amazement isn't when I would take that risk, that step of faith say I'm going to do something with my family to make a difference and connect with them. We've got to be connecting with our wives and our children. We got to do that. That when I said I'm not I'm gonna turn off my cell phone, leave a message hey, I'm in Hawaii, please call my competitor do something else, you know, something like that. Don't call me I'm on vacation. You want to come back my phone rings again, we're ready to sign that contract. We're ready to sign that. And so we get back Friday I work 12 or 13 hours signing contracts, and doing the Dickies roof among other things. So the truth of the matter is what we do trust God. And the point I'm making is that we have to take time for our families. Because we live such rat race lives. We're so busy going here going there. You know, your kids might not remember that you worked how much overtime your work last week, or that you had a month a sales record last month that they broke all records. But though they will remember that you took time with him took him fishing, did something with them, have some meaning. And so we need to realize that our focus isn't just on this life we're planning to spend eternity with God worshiping and praising him forever and I want to leave my wife and children and everybody else there that I can. So what this life is about is building connections with the people that we love the most. My wife, my children, my son in law and and others that come into the family. And we need to remember that the family was the first institution that God created in Genesis chapter two, it is the building block of modern civilization in the home and America is crumbling it really it has crumbled. And maybe around the world that has it's unfortunate with Christian homes are falling apart. So I'm saying we've got to make time for our film doesn't necessarily mean the vacation but doing things together and prioritizing that. And seeking God's kingdom and his righteousness first in our eyes meeting. The first in our lives means that we're going to put our family ahead of our job, our hobbies and our even our career.

Mike Roy  13:48
It's not about making money, it's about saving souls. And number one, I want to say my family. And so I learned the importance even though it's so hard for men from from V especially to to to turn off the work mindset say I'm gonna spend time with my family and not thinking about work right now. It'll be there when we get back. So priority. Prioritizing family time is really, really important. Number three, one of the lessons I learned to let go of your crutches. Well, in all my years of skiing, I never have dropped my ski poles going up the chairlift to the height to the mountain never dropped. I've seen other people do that. I never dropped them. So we're going up to one of the slopes and Jesse and I are hitting up there and I'm probably checking my playlist on my phone that's really important. Make sure the music's playing with him going down the mountain I dropped the ski pole. I thought this is not good. So I can do it at once keep hold better than zero. Then we kept going up the lift and I dropped another ski pole. Now I've got zero ski poles going up there Jesse said his be all right Dad. So I said all right, Was there nothing else I can do? He can't buy any ski poles on a chairlift. So I thought, well, we're gonna I will get up there and, like somewhat nervously get off the chairlift and started my descent down the mountain. So I'll just do my best, you know, and go for it. And to my surprise, it was invigorating. I was skiing like Bodhi Miller. I mean, I was just going down there singing songs, I didn't do any backflip. It was liberating. I couldn't believe it. I had convinced myself that I needed ski poles. And I really didn't. And for the rest of the time there since I only had one, I never used any, I mean just had one with me. So I just kind of held it as a balance and was kind of skiing down a mountain. So I learned that sometimes we have crutches that we hold on to that we just don't really need. And so to me, that was an amazing, amazing thing that I learned now, getting to and from the ski lifts, the ski poles are helpful. But then I'm talking to Jesse. So now my buddy Jake and Brighton never use a ski poles. Wow. Then I started looking around on the slopes and all these guys are skiing with us ski poles. I thought and that's that, wow. But skiing without the ski poles was was really exhilarating. For me. It changed the way I skied. So it was a it's a lesson for me, that maybe some of the things that we lean on to in our lives are crutches that we just don't need. Sometimes as people, we're overly dependent on some people. Sometimes it's medicine that we use to manage our emotions, we learned we can drop that don't have to have that. Sometimes it's just fear or anxiety or worry. But the point I'm making that dropping those two ski poles just changed my whole perspective and learned a lesson that I never would have never learned otherwise. And I think well maybe I'll just get rid of them completely and just enjoy myself. And again, the lesson is for all of us, no matter what the the crutches that we use to support our lives let go and let God Proverbs chapter three, verses three through five is still a vital lesson for us trusting the Lord with all your heart. And do not lean on your own understanding but to all your ways acknowledge Him and He will make your paths straight. So there's a lesson let go sometimes with the crutches that we all lean on, you think you need them, you find out you know what, you really don't need them. So that's one of the things I learned on this trip. Another lesson. Now this is this is powerful. But it's important it's okay to fall. You know, sometimes the fear of falling is more paralyzing the than the false self spiritually or physically. But that's that's a truth that we have to learn, especially as Christians. And just for the record, I just want to share with you, generally speaking, when I ski and have through the years, that sugar mountain at perfect north, I don't hardly ever fall. And it may be because I'm always skiing in the safe mode. Like Jesse says, he says just go with it. But I generally don't fall but I do from from time to time, but this time, I felt at least four times. I remember the first day coming down in Mountain View and a little zigzag slalom, and my skis just kind of fell out beneath my feet. Fair thought, this isn't so bad. It's okay to fall, dust yourself up, off and get up and keep going again.

Mike Roy  18:16
And at one point, I remember taking a break, maybe a bathroom break, get back on, put my skis on, I was probably going maybe you know, a quarter mile and all of a sudden my face is in the snow and I hit my head in the snow. My boots came out of my ski bindings, I didn't have them in there properly. So again, best off to snow get up and keep going again. But the point I would make is that after each fall, I would dust myself off and just resolve to keep keep going down the mountain. And so the point I make is Christians, God gives us abundant grace for our slips or stumbles and falls. That's the point. We don't want to fall. I don't want to fall skiing. I don't want to fall spiritually. But we all we all slip we all stumble from time to time. And you remember that statement in Romans chapter five, verse 20. You don't have turned air Paul says we're seeing increased Grace about it all the more. We're seeing increased Grace even increased more than that. So Paul had to say in homes have to six Shall we continue in sin that grace may about no. But we're seeing increases grace, God's grace increases even more. Hebrews chapter four, verse 16, says Therefore let us come boldly to the throne of grace that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need. So this is another liberating truth because we want to live our lives mistake free and sin free. And the reality is we all stumble. I mean, everybody, everybody we all do from time to time. Peter did everybody did all the disciples for so Jesus at the cross, everybody? Every single one of them. They came back. So God's grace sufficient for all of our failures, get up, dust yourself off, turn from sin, and get back in the race, so to speak. So that's a powerful lesson. And remember hearing here, Hannah, talk about that we're going somewhere. And she said, You know, I just kind of want to go ahead and get my fault over with. Because, you know, you know, you're gonna fall at some point, it's, so once you do, it's like, it's not so bad. Case, another lesson I learned when life throws you a curveball, hit it. It's actually the title of a little book that I've got in my house. But it's a again, a lesson I learned on the slope, we're always trying to make the best decisions in life, right, we all try to do that. Sometimes we do. Sometimes we don't. But when Jesse and I would ski, we went up to a higher elevation. And I generally try to stay on the green and the blue trail. So that's the easier trails in a blue, it can be somewhat difficult, but they're the better try stay away from the Black Diamond has to Black Diamond, don't even go near it. That's not good. So we're on a blue trail, and coming down, and I didn't really pay attention to these charts and the graphs of all the slopes. And so I didn't really know where to go. So we're coming down, not doing too badly. And also, like I saying, maybe I'll take this trail. And I came up to it was like a vertical drop off a cliff. I went, Whoa, this is not fun. And there's no turning around at that point. Once you kind of pick your trail unless you take your skis off and hike back up the mountain. I thought they deceived me. This is supposed to be a blue trail, not a black trip, man. It was tech technically a Blu ray to trail. But I understand you can't they can't go through in every single little trail that comes up. They they're gonna put okay, this is a black diamond. But anyway, I looked down there and thought, wow, what am I gonna do. And so generally, when we ski together, I go first and adjust, he follows me this time, he went first and kind of get down to the bottom. So I went in and I'll say just, you know, bit the bullet and that type of thing. And not too long after the thing that made it more challenging. It wasn't very wide. If you have like a Black Diamond Trail, and it's wide, least you can kind of slalom and make it across and get yourself down. But if it's a narrow thing, it's more challenging. So I had a big Wipeout. And then I was trying to get myself back up, my ski stayed on, then I was exhausted, like, I couldn't breathe. You know, like I'm out of breath. And finally I looked down at the bottom of Hill Jesse's like, go for it, which is where he always does it on the mountain. So so I found it, I did go for it. And so I made it down to the bottom alive and nothing broken. You might describe my skiing at that point. More like with Buzz Lightyear said he was falling with style. Except that wasn't skiing or falling a style, it was not very attractive, but I made it to the bottom I said, okay, just no more of those, whether they call it black diamond, or blue diamond is not for me. But the point I make is that sometimes life throws you a curveball. And it's really difficult. And there's nothing that you can do except to confront it and to face it. And it might be that loss of a job.

Mike Roy  23:06
You lose your job that's big, might be the loss of a spouse, a parent a child, it might be desertion. You're by yourself and maybe you didn't deserve it. That's hard. That is really, really hard. You're by yourself, maybe you're totally innocent. These things are not easy to deal with. And I say again, that God's grace and strength are sufficient are sufficient for all of our struggles and challenges. But sometimes we have to stare at difficulty in the face that I came to the edge of that mouth had nothing to do except to own it. So this is my mouth, I'm going to ski it, I have to do it. There's no way there's no other option. It's not what I want to do, I have to find a way to go through to make a way I have to take the bull by the horns and find my way through that. And so it's a reminder, that difficulty has come away. Now like that phrase when so when life throws you a curveball, just hit it step up there, stand back and lean into it and swing. And that's what we have to do. Jesus faith face betrayal, Judas, betrayed him all his disciples of the mansion for so can he was mocked, ridiculed, beaten, despised and rejected. He faced difficult, difficult things in the garden. His disciples couldn't even stay awake with him. But again, Jesus stayed focused on his task, he took the bull by the horns. He overcame everything. And we must do the same as we seek to follow him. You know, in Luke chapter nine, verse 51. It says when the days drew nearer for Jesus to be taken up to go back to heaven. It says that he said his fate he steadfastly said his face, to go to Jerusalem. Sometimes we have to steadfastly set our face to go to heaven. We have to resolve that we're going to do God's will at all. cost and bite the bullet is we sometimes say, to muster that dogged determination to do what God wants us to do, and heaven is there for the taking. But sometimes we have to look at great difficulty in the face and overcome it. Even if it's what we sometimes called the wicked curveball, that's kind of hard to hit. But if life throws you something like that, stand back and swing, golf and bleaches. Otherwise, you intimidated and overwhelmed. So that's another lesson I

Mike Roy  25:31
learned. Another point I want to another lesson I've learned is, especially from this trip, having the right equipment makes a big difference in how we live our lives successfully and faithfully in God's sight. So we got there on Tuesday, and I generally have through the years haven't found in the ski goggles, it really works. Somebody gave me some years ago, too small, they didn't really work. But by the time I put bandana on there to get fogged up, so I've wear sunglasses, and I tried to put something on my face like a bandana. It wasn't really working. So I said, I'll just use the sunglasses. Well, by the end of the day, my nose is still red, can you see it? It was like ugly, red, horrible. So that night, we went to sun and ski, so I gotta get some ski goggles, I was afraid I couldn't get something that I could see through what about my glasses, we found some nice ones, I could actually wear my glasses under the ski goggles, which I didn't do. But with the new ski goggles, I can see perfectly. I got one of those gators, a face warmer and neck warmer and I was doing I was great. On the slopes the next day, it was wonderful. I can see everything, clearly my face was warm. And so the point I was making here is that having the right equipment can make a big difference. And even though sometimes, you know you see golfers might get fogged up a little bit. That should be third degree Winburn and sunburn on your face. And that and that can clear up pretty quickly. And the point that I'm making is spiritually we have we have some great tools at our disposal. The best tool for our spiritual battle is the word of God. We need to take it we need to use it. And just think about this in our religious world isn't it may be a shame that so many people in various groups don't even study the Bible. They don't read their Bible. But what about us that we let the Bible sit on a shelf, not take us with it take our sword with us to work on these trips. We need to remind ourselves that the Bible is a message from God Himself. It is a love letter from heaven. And we need to recognize that that God's given us the greatest promises that have moral Kinder see, to spend eternity with God to share His glory, His honor, his praise, comfort, all of that. And the God the Word of God also contains some dire warnings of endless torment and suffering if we harden our hearts to God. So the point I'm making, spiritually speaking, you've got it in your hand. The Bible is your roadmap to heaven, but God wants us to drink it into deeply meditate upon it. And the point is, you can't overcome the devil on your own. With your own wisdom, we need to have the right preparation, the right equipment. A couple other points that I want to mention this evening things that I learned, I'm just kind of put these brief phrases because they kind of catchy preparation is half the battle. Be prepared for for living your life spiritually. It's also true for the mountain experience. So before we enjoy the breathtaking runs down the mountains, and seeing the majestic mountains in the sky, and all that stuff, there's a lot of planning, a lot of preparation, you're gonna get airline tickets, and you get car rental and equipment and all this stuff. When you finally get to the slopes. If you have your equipment or you rent it, you have to carry that stuff up there. That's kind of exhausting. By the time you get all your stuff on. It's like I'm out of breath. But then you go up to the mountain and you start coming down, say, Wow, this is wonderful. The point is that you can't get to the mountaintop without a lot of preparation. And the point I make is it's it's worth it. So so the one of the lessons I was impressed with this, the fact that preparation is so important. Everything that we do in life and release is half the battle. If we will prepare ourselves spiritually, then we can overcome the difficulties that we face. In our lives. We need to remember that planning and preparation are essential for basically anything that we do in life. And if we want to go to heaven, you have to prepare for that eternal home. We have to make preparations for that. And the time to prepare for that is right now. Jesus warns us of the foolishness of laying up treasures on earth. Instead, he advises us to lay up treasures in heaven. He said that's where our hearts are going to be if our treasures are up in heaven. And so again, it's a reminder for us. If you want to go to heaven, I trust that we all do preparation. Preparation is really what it's all about. It's let's make use of phrases half the battle. And that means you have to be born again.

Mike Roy  30:10
If someone is here tonight has not been born again, you have to be born again to go to heaven. You can't get there. You can't be part of God's kingdom. Jesus says he cannot see the kingdom of God. So preparation is what it's all about. Somebody said that heaven is a prepared place for a prepared people. So are you are we preparing for heaven? Are we prepared to die? We need to live with that reality. One other point this evening, I want to share from my our trip to the mountains. Ultimately, this experience taught me to, to learn to trust God more fully to be more thankful for all his power and his providence again, as I scan the horizon, and could see the lofty skies and the mountains, I realized that God really is in control. He's bigger than this world. He's bigger than your problems and your trials and your difficulties and all that stuff. I remind myself that by keeping this bracelet on my hand, it says God is bigger. So God is bigger. And so the mountain experiences communicate to us that you have trials in your life and difficulties and challenges we all do. God is bigger than anything in every one any issues that we might be facing in our lives. He feeds the sparrows, he feeds the groundhogs he feeds to feeds the grizzly bears, okay, maybe they eat by themselves, but he taught them how to do that. Right. He provides for all of his creation. And the scripture says He owns the cattle on 1000 hills, actually, God owns everything. We've been taught that in our theme this year of stewardship, God owns everything. He's bigger than everything bigger than everyone. If he graciously provides the sunshine in the rain, he nurtures the soil and all the wildlife he provides for you. And for me, there's nothing too difficult for God to deal with. And there's nothing too big or too difficult in your life that God can't handle. So when you get on those majestic math, you realize, I serve an awesome God, and He cares about you and me. And so a reminder for each one of us as we scan the horizon, as we've sung the songs this evening, that we serve a great and an awesome God, a God of inherent goodness. And so as we wrap up the lesson this evening and extend that invitation, we need to remind ourselves that God is great, he is holy, He is awesome, and we can fully trust God to meet every need that we have in our lives. So oftentimes we doubt that we question that, but we don't need to question the goodness of God the power of God. Whereas Conrad prayed the love of God you hear this evening and you need help with the struggles we serve an awesome God and God bigger than you troubles bringing in new trials. We're here to help each one of us. serve God faith with you here this evening neath respond to the invitation in any way might come always standing seeing this invitation song
