It's good to see you here tonight if you want to open up your Bibles to Romans, the second chapter. On Wednesday nights we're studying from the book of Romans. And tonight, we're gonna look at a section of verses, verses six through 11 that we didn't get to cover in our class this past Wednesday. As we think about this idea of God, showing no partiality. If you've followed the news lately, you might have heard about this college admissions scandal that has been talked about quite frequently. And it has rocked the academic world, there have been a number of celebrities and high profile individuals that have been charged in the case most notably the an actress from Full House. I think Aunt Becky, is who she played Lori Loughlin and her husband were charged. But there's also some others a successful businessman, a CEO, a dentist, and a well respected attorney from New York. And essentially what happened was, they were indicted for paying large sums of money, anywhere from 1000s to upwards of $6 million

in order to have the AC T and sa t scores for their children changed so that they could be admitted into these prestigious schools. There was also some cases where they were accepted to be a part of an athletic team at one of the colleges for a sport that they had never played in high school, or they didn't have the skill to compete at a college level. And there were a number of school officials that were also indicted for taking bribes for being a part of this scheme and allowing these students to get in and all this was done so that they could go to these well respected schools, Yale, Georgetown, Stanford, and the University of South Southern California. You know, we live in a world today where people are driven and motivated by money. And it's as if you put enough zeros at the end of the check, and you can just about get whatever you want. But in Romans two, Paul describes God and His character, in terms that are very different from those that we see in the world. God operates completely different and that he shows no partiality. He is not bias. He is not swayed by appearances. And so let's look and see what these verses have to say about God and His character. Read with me in Romans two and verse six. It says, He will render to each one according to his works, to those who by patience and well doing seek for glory and honor and immortality, he will give eternal life. But for those who are self seeking, and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness, there will be wrath and fury, there will be tribulation and distress for every human being who does evil, the Jew first and also the Greek, but glory and honor and peace for everyone who does good, the Jew first, and also the Greek, for God shows no partiality. In this section, Paul is discussing the the judgment of God in verse three, he makes the point that no one is going to escape God's judgment, everyone will stand before the throne of God and verse five, he makes reference to the righteous judgment of God is fair and just and impartial in his judgments. And verses six through 11 Give us a picture of God's judgment, what that looks like what it really means. First of all, notice that there is a parallel structure. Here in these verses, it follows a chaotic structure and a B, C, C, B, A. And what that means is verses six and 11. They align up together they have the same thought the same idea seven and 10. Go together and then a and nine, verse 60, will render to each one according to his words. Verse 11, God shows no partiality. Verse seven, those who by patience and well doing seek for glory and honor they are seeking these things. And in verse 10, glory and honor and peace will be given to those who are doing good. And then in the middle, you have a section on those who are self seeking and do not obey the truth but obey unreal It just SNESs and they receive wrath and tribulation and distress for those who do who do evil. Also notice that there is a heavy emphasis on works. In verse six, he talks about according to his works, verse seven, those who are well doing in verse eight, he emphasizes not obeying or obeying unrighteousness, verse nine, the one who does things that are evil. In verse 10, everyone who does good, Romans is often used by people in the religious world to say that we are saved by faith only, or that we are saved just by having belief or holding to some idea about God in our minds. But Paul begins and ends his letter in Romans talking about the obedience of faith in chapter one and verse five. And also at the end of the letter in chapter 16, in verse 26, he talks about obedience and faith and how those two come together. And certainly this section would fit with that theme. There are two different groups that are described in these verses, those who are doing well and those who are not doing well. And we can break these groups down into three different categories, what they do, what they seek, and then ultimately what they will receive. So the first group is referenced in verses seven and 10, the second group verses eight and nine, that section in the middle there. But this first group is well doing what's right there, well doing, they're doing good. The second group, it says they do not obey the truth, they obey unrighteousness Those are their actions. Notice that those who do well are seeking for glory and for honor and for immortality, those are noble pursuits, things that

Conrad Harkrider  07:03
that are our blessings. And then the second group, he says in verse eight, they are self seeking, they're concerned about their own interests and desires. The first group will ultimately receive eternal life, glory and honor and peace that God is going to bestow on those who are who are doing well. And the second group will receive wrath and fury, tribulation, and distress. So let's look at go a little deeper now that you kind of have a sense of the structure here of what he's talking about. Let's go a little deeper. Look at verse six again, he says, He will render to each one according to his works, he will render to each one according to his works. The first thing that we can notice here about God not showing partiality is that we are ultimately accountable to God. He says that God is going to render he's going to repay or give each person according to their works. Have you ever seen one of those old deserted houses that's out in the country? We were driving in East Tennessee a few months ago in the Smoky Mountains, and we passed by this old house, that was completely rundown, the the sides were falling off, the roof was caving in, there was a tree that had fallen down on top of it. And I told my wife, I said, I bet you we could get a pretty good deal on that place if we're looking for the mountain cabin. But it was, it was clear that no one was paying attention. Whoever had owned it had just let it go. God did not just create the world and build everything that we see and then step away from it. It's not as if he put us here on Earth, and now he has no parts and we can say and act and think and do whatever we want. We are responsible to him. And ultimately we will give an answer to God. He is the one who gave us life. He is the source of all of our blessings. He's given us His Word. And one day we will give an account for the things that we have done. Notice who this applies to. He says in verse six, he will render to each one. Then the King James Version says he will render to every man. Verse nine says that this will be done to every human being. Can you wrap your mind around that? Every single person that's living today, people who are well respected those who are who are in positions of authority Empower kings and presidents, those who are successful, those who are rich, those who are well known who are great athletes, poor people, black people, white people, Hispanic people, every person is going to answer to God. This is also an individual exercise, we won't stand as a city before the throne of God, we won't stand as a church, we won't stand as a family or as a couple, he will render to each and every person according to their works. And the key phrase here is at the end of the verse, he says, according to his works, based upon the things that we have done in this life, there is a juxtaposition in the book of Romans, that is two ideas to thoughts that are contrasting that are laid side by side. On the one hand, God does not save us, he does not

Conrad Harkrider  11:06
free us from our sins, based upon our own worthiness, the things that we have done our own goodness, it's not because we come from the right family, or because we have the right background, or in the case of the Jews, because we follow the law of Moses or because we are circumcised. Salvation comes only through faith in Jesus Christ. And without that it doesn't really matter what we do, the only path to God is through Christ. So that's on the one hand, but on the other hand, even though our actions are not what save us, our deeds are not what wash away our sins, God is still concerned with the things that we do. He's still interested in our actions, our actions matter to God. Sin is going beyond what God has said, it's a transgression of His Word. And sin has, hasn't always will be something that is important to God, something that turns his face away from us. So we are not saved by what we do. But what we do is critical in pleasing God, you see how those things are, are contrasting. Let me give an illustration that, hopefully will help you think about this idea of our good works, and then how God ultimately will save us. Last week, I was doing some work around the house, and I needed a ladder. And not just the step stool ladder, but the 2025 foot ladder that goes all the way up to the very top. And I got up there, and I was standing on the second third, the last rung. And I now have a greater appreciation for people who work on roofs and do work around houses because they have to be a little crazy to get up there day in and day out, being up that high. But what would have happened to me if I had reached over to my right, and leaned a little too much. At best, I would have been seriously injured, but there's a good chance that if I would have been killed by falling from that height, I want you to think about sin like falling off the ladder. Now, if I was working on the house, and I told you I had a good day, I only fell off the ladder one time would that be a success? Or what if someone fell off the ladder 100 times if that was possible. Sin is like falling off the ladder and the result is the same it leads to spiritual death. Jesus Christ is the one who saves a person who has fallen. He is the Restore. And after we fall, he can come and heal us and bring us back to be whole again. But staying on the ladder is not what saves you once you've fallen off. You can't say to yourself, Well, I've been on this ladder for 10 years and I've never fallen not one time. That doesn't matter because our own deeds are not sufficient. But at the same time, think about once we have fallen off the ladder and now been restored. Does it make any sense that we would be climbing up carelessly, that we would be swinging around at the top or leaning back or not paying attention? Treating the fall as a trivial thing as something that is not a big deal? This is what Paul says in Romans six and verse one. Shall we continue in sin so that grace may abound, sin is a separation from God. And it is our words, our deeds that cause that separations. So our life, we need to be more careful, more conscientious, more aware of how we're handling ourselves what we're doing, the way that we're climbing, and pay close attention to our walk. This text is not about being perfect people, that if we are perfect people, that God will somehow reward us, God knew that we would stumble, and he knew that we needed atonement for our sins. And that's why he set this plan in place before the world began to send Jesus to be an atonement for our sins. But notice, I believe the emphasis here is on what we seek after what are we seeking?

Conrad Harkrider  15:55
Let's start with the negative first in verse eight. In verse eight, he describes those, he says, Those who are self seeking and do not obey the truth, but obey unrighteousness. They are self seeking. And we see that self seeking ultimately leads to judgment, the New American Standard for this word self seeking says selfishly ambitious, they are concerned with their own interests and desires. It's as if the world is revolving around them. Think about a politician who is seeking political office, not because they are trying to change their community or because they are interests, they are interested in helping the public or serving other people, but rather, they are seeking office because they want the recognition. They want their interests to be advanced to be pushed forward, maybe they have some investments in a certain area. And they, they believe that by getting into office, they'll be able to influence the decisions that impact them, the regulations and whatnot. They are self seeking. In Matthew chapter 20. There's an account that's told about the mother of James and John, and she comes to the Lord and she makes a request. She says, I want these two sons of mine to sit one on your right hand and the other on your left, essentially, she's saying, I want them to have the top positions in your kingdom. Jesus says you don't know what you're asking for. He says, are you able to drink the cup that I'm about to drink, and they say we are able, these men and their mom were ambitious, they wanted to move forward, to get to the top to be the greatest. But to be elevated in the Lord's Kingdom means that we have to be a servant. In Matthew chapter 20, in verse 25, in response to this, Jesus says, you know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and they're great ones exercise authority over them, it shall not be so among you. But whoever would be great among you must be your servant. And whoever would be first among you must be your slave, even as the Son of Man came not to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many. What Jesus says, and what the world say are so completely different. The world says that in order to get ahead, you've got to be aggressive. You have to be assertive, you have to be on top of things, you have to stick up for yourselves. And oftentimes that comes at the expense of other people, we elevate ourselves and tear others down. This idea of self seeking is a dangerous path to follow. All of us think about ourselves to a certain extent. In Ephesians, chapter five, Paul talks about how no one ever hated his own flesh but nourishes and cherishes. It's not wrong to care about our own interests in ourselves. But the question is, is that the only thing that we are thinking about? Growing in our walk with Christ means growing in our awareness of other people, those around us in the body of Christ outside the body of Christ, thinking about their needs, thinking about the needs of the kingdom and what God would ultimately have us to do. Think about Jesus, when he looked out upon the crowds, and he saw the people. He didn't just see a hinderance or a burden. He didn't just see an opportunity in terms of his own selfish gain. It says that he looked out and he saw them like sheep who did not have a shepherd. And he cared about people. He listened to them. He talked to them he ate with them. He prayed for them. He wasn't self seeking, he sought the benefit of others. yours. This attitude and heart of self centeredness has serious implications. As Paul says here, it ultimately leads to disregarding God's truth, to obeying unrighteousness. And ultimately God is going to judge and punish those who are lovers and promoters of self. also noticed verse seven verse seven, this is the contrast it says to those who by patience and well doing seek for glory and honor and mortality, he will give eternal life. In Christ, God is going to reward those who do well and well doing ultimately leads to in in mortality. Did you notice how they are doing good? Did you notice how they're going about this well

Conrad Harkrider  20:52
doing? It says, By patience in well doing the New American Standard says, by perseverance, they are persistent in doing good. It is a continual, ongoing process. You ever get tired of, of doing good? You ever get tired of being the one who is reaching out who's taking the high road? Who's extending the hand who's offering to help? Who's showing interest in the lives of other people? After a while, we start to think, what's the point no one seems to appreciate or recognize the effort that we're putting forward. Or like the psalmist in Psalm 73, when he looked around at all those who did not serve God, and they seemed to be doing great. He said, They have no struggles, their bodies are healthy and strong, they are free from common human burdens. They are not plagued by human ills. Why am I going to all of this trouble? Why am I not doing things that, from the world's view seem to be fun? And why do I put myself through these things that are hard and difficult and challenging? With my money and my time and how I'm spending my life? How does this make sense? We see that serving God is not about obtaining some immediate, worldly blessing. When the disciples began to follow Jesus, they left everything. There was no huge payday that they received, they didn't. All of the sudden have glory and honor and fame and recognition. In fact, it was the opposite. They would eventually face persecution and rejection and ridicule for their faith and devotion to the Lord. But the blessings that God offer come at the end of the race, not during not wallets going on. And so that's why we need this patience and endurance. Patients in doing good. It's one thing to do good for a couple of days. It's one thing to do good for a few weeks. But what about doing good, month after month, year after year for an entire lifetime. That's what Paul says in Galatians six and verse nine, let us not grow weary in doing good for in due season we shall reap if we do not give up. Notice what we are seeking after glory and honor and immortality. There was a Spanish explorer by the name of Ponce de Leon. And in the 1500s, he set sail for what is now the coast of Florida. And he was in in search of the fountain of youth, the local natives had told him about this place that had these waters, that could rejuvenate a person if they drink from them. And so he was in search of, of these, this special place where he could drink and never grow old. But unfortunately, he was seeking for immortality in the wrong place. There are many today who are seeking for glory and honor and to be immortalized, but they're searching for it in the wrong place. It look for it in their money or in their reputation or in their occupation or in their accomplishments or achievements in this world. But ultimately those pursuits are fruitless, because only the only the Lord can bestow true honor and glory. And one day he will give to those who have faithfully served him eternal life. In Romans six and verse 23. It says that the free gift of God The wages of sin is death, but the free The gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord, the free gift. God is not charging us for this. It is a gift by His grace that he offers to us. And if you stop to think about just meditate on, next time you're driving, in your car on your commute, think about eternal

Conrad Harkrider  25:26
life. It's difficult to even wrap our minds around that idea to live for eternity. A person who will never die, they will never get sick, they'll never grow old. That's what God is offering to us. It is a free gift that he graciously and willingly gives to those who seek after him. Doing good is not the easiest course, to take Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego were thrown into a fiery furnace because they were unwilling to submit to the commands of the king. But if we trust in God, and we're persistent in our service to Him, ultimately, he will reward us with something that is far more valuable than anything that we could obtain in this life. When we think about the judgment of God, it can be overwhelming. This passage speaks of His wrath and his fury. And it can be terrifying. But as children of God, we take comfort in knowing that God is not partial or biased in his judgment, he shows no partiality. Judges who are appointed today, they they make decisions based upon their political leanings, their ideologies, they, they choose cases, based upon their own interpretation, how they understand and view the law. There are also judges who base their decisions on preferences on external appearances on the things they like or don't like. But God is not swayed by any of those things. He's not influenced by wealth or status or power. He says here that he will give to the Jew first and also to the Greek. That is God's righteous judgment is going to be equally distributed, it's going to be given to all people regardless of their background or nationality, or where they live, or how they look or, or where they've come from. He is no respecter of persons, he does not arbitrarily favor one group over another. One of the challenges of raising children is the ability to treat them with fairness. When a child comes to you, and they say that someone took my toy, your initial instinct is to punish the thief, the one who has committed the wrong. But over time, and through trial and error, you quickly realize that the one who is coming to announce the offense is not always telling you the entire story. Yes, they took your toy, but were you pulling their hair or biting their hand. These are all hypothetical scenarios. But you realize that you don't have all of the information you have to do some investigating. The difference with God is that he doesn't have to ask to get the other side of the story. He already knows God is completely reasonable and righteous and fair in his judgments. Hebrews chapter four in verse 13, says, Nothing in all of creation is hidden from God's sight. Everything is uncovered and laid bare before the eyes of Him to whom we must give account. Now in some ways that can be scary, that can be terrifying. But as God's people, it brings us great comfort and hope. Because if you are serving Him faithfully, and diligently, and following His Word, God is going to take take note of that he's going to see the things that you're doing, even if no one else recognizes it, or pays attention to it. If people around you in your family or in your work group or your community, disregard or discount the things you're doing, God sees and knows. But on the other side of that those who do evil who seemed to get away with things, and seem to be living a life that there's no consequences for their actions. One day they will stand before the throne of an eternal King, the eternal King of heaven, and they will give an account for what they've done on this earth. God shows no partiality.

Conrad Harkrider  30:15
And one day, he will render to each one according to his works. If you're not a Christian tonight, we urge you to think seriously about your relationship with God. Because no matter how much good you have done in your life, no matter how generous you are, and how well meaning your life may have been, it's incomplete. It's not sufficient without Jesus Christ. Only through faith in Him, can we be forgiven of our sins, and have hope of eternal life. If you're not a Christian, you can become one tonight by submitting yourself to God repenting of your sins and being baptized for the forgiveness of your sins. If there's something that we can do to encourage you or to help you and your walk, please come down to the front as we stand and sing
