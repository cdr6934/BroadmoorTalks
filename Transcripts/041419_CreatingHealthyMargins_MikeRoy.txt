It certainly is a great opportunity to come in worship are great. And Holy God, He is worthy of that praises God has given us a wonderful day, beautiful day the sun is shining. And we are here to worship God. Because we have all made it a priority to be here, we could have done a lot of other things, we understand that. But we have made that a priority. So we are here to praise God to remember the greatest sacrifice ever made on our behalf to participate in that together and to sing songs of praise to God's holy name, and also to be filled with more messages from his words we did this morning in our adult class, as I planned to do this morning this lesson, appreciate the songs that they've led for us. And as they will complement my lesson. Some of you may remember a song by Alabama, they get a lot of songs that were popular that they came up with, but that one song is called I'm in a hurry, Jesse and I sometimes play that song and sing that. It might do that for us some time. But it says that at least the first four verses I'm in a hurry, and I don't know why I rush and rush to life's no fun. All I really got to do is live and die. But I'm in a hurry. And don't know why. I think that describes most of us to at least at different times in our lives, too many of us are way too busy in our lives. I think our lives tend to be overloaded with activities, cares, worries, all types of things that we're doing trying to do too much in the span of time that we have. And it produces enormous stress and strain in our lives. And even when we are with family whom we love, our minds are often somewhere else thinking about work are going to pay the bills, this so many things going on. And we so we find ourselves stretched too thin. In many areas, we are as somebody said, we are living margin LIS lives, there's not enough margin. And without the margin. There are some fairly serious consequence. I think it's ironic because I've been planning to preset for a while I'm working on it this week, or tried to one of the busiest weeks of my work, and pushing it to the limit, Saturday trying to get everything put together. And just reminds me that I need to build margin of my life as much as anybody does. And so I want to talk with you this morning about creating healthy margins in your life. And I want to stress by saying first of all this is this is a real need of all the means that you and I have in our lives, this may be your greatest need today, to apply this truth to your life, it certainly is perhaps for me. And I want to suggest also that I'm talking about creating healthy margins. Margin doesn't just happen in our lives, we must create margin. And there are consequences, sometimes serious consequences if we don't create proper margins in our life. So let's talk about that. This morning. I'll begin with some definitions. And and really what what the issues are relating to margin or lack of margin. And then we're going to look at what the Bible has to say, how do we create margin? What kind of priorities do we have to make in our lives to do that, but one writer said this, that margin is the difference between what you have and what you need, I'm going to share a couple of different definitions. And for example, if you are going to a place and it's gonna take you 20 minutes to get there and you have a 30 minute window of time, then you have a 10 minute margin. That's good. But if we're going to is going to take 40 minutes to get there and all you have is 30 minutes, all of a sudden you're stressed and you're strange and you're frustrated, because you didn't have enough margin, and you got there late and you miss something that was important. So we might say that margin is the difference between what you have and what you need. Let's just go through a dictionary definition from my phone. So margin is the space around the printed or written matter on the page. Just like you're seeing the screen is lots of white area around the wording that says margin is an amount allowed or available beyond what is actually necessary. So a little cushion so to speak. It is a limit in condition, capacity, etc. Beyond or below which something ceases to exist, be desirable or even be possible. Without proper margins, we can get ourselves into serious trouble. It mentions the margin of endurance. Anybody running a race, or hoping to run a race realizes if we don't have enough margin and planning and preparation, we won't be able to endure talking about the margin of sanity.

Mike Roy  04:54
If we don't produce enough margin in our lives, you thought you hear about people losing their minds. And so it's a very relevant and vital area that we have to address at least from time to time. Dr. Richard Swenson wrote a book called margin is kind of a classic in the field. And this is his quotation I like this is a margin, on the other hand is having breath left at the top of the staircase, money left at the end of the month and sanity left at the end of adolescence. While we relate to that, because of the stress and the strain of the struggles, and we live our lives with putting in too much activity, too many agendas on our plate, and then we, we get into trouble. And in this particular book, I think basically the first five chapters, focuses on what he calls the problem, which is the pain, the stress, the difficulty. And then in chapter 6010, he provides the solution which his solution to all the pain that we experienced in the stress and strain is called margin, we need to have margin. So let's think about this for just a minute. What happens when there's little or no margin in our lives. And think about that? Well, again, as One writer says, When margin decreases, our stress increases. So do you want to have more stress in your life or less. So if you want to have less stress in your life, then it means we need to increase our margins. But when we when we decrease our margins, and they get smaller and smaller than our stress increases. Secondly, as our margin decreases, our relationships decrease and suffer also want to have meaningful relationships with your spouse, your children, your parents, brothers and sisters in Christ, whoever it might be. If we if we don't have enough margin in our lives, then these relationships all HURT How many families are in even in marriage relationship are two people living in the same house, but they don't know each other. Because they're going in a million different directions and don't spend time with the children as they ought to. So these are just some little things to think about. When margin decreases. stress increases, when margin decreases our relationships, decrease in suffering. How many of us have seen this I know you have go out to eat for dinner, go to the restaurant. I'm like Kondo say over here to my right. Fear is there for people's a family of four, a mom and dad, a son and a daughter, I thought, wow, this is great. Family getting together, you know, talking interacting with each other. And you look over there, and look over there. And all the heads are like this.

Mike Roy  07:45
Nobody's talking to each other. They're all on their phones, or their iPads or their tablet. And somebody is texting somebody and somebody is surfing the internet. Somebody is downloading some music for their app. I mean, this just going on and on. And then that beautiful picture, this husband and wife and son and daughter become sad. Here they are at dinner. And they have no relation to no relational interaction with each other. So again, we realize the danger of this taking place. We see that in scriptural look at several things. But look at Luke chapter 10. I've got this on the screen this morning. And I think Luke Chapter 10 The story of Martha and Mary, or Mary and Martha's we sometimes say illustrates, I think the lack of margin, especially in Martha's life, says as they were traveling along, he entered a village and a woman named Martha welcomed him into her home. She had a sister called Mary who was seated, seated at the Lord's feet listening to his word. But Martha was distracted with all her preparations. And she came up to him and said, Lord, do you not care that my sister has left me to do all the serving alone, that tell her to help me? But the Lord answered and said to her mom, Martha, Martha, you are worried and bothered about so many things, but only one thing is necessary for Mary has chosen the good part, which shall not be taken away from her. So you look at this context over here. And Martha invites Jesus into her home and Mary's there is no doubt all types of preparations. Does Mary not have any preparations, laundry to fold, food to prepare all types of things that she has. But Martha is all concerned about these things. Mary is sitting at the feet of Jesus. That's a higher priority. Then making sure the tables clean. Now you want to have your table clean, that type of thing, your bathrooms clean and all that other stuff. But Mary is sitting at Jesus feet. Martha is too distracted and she's allowed all these things to crowd out her margin in We're live. Look at this from I mentioned this at the beginning of lesson. So on this screen just by way of illustration, this is the margin all around the text. So we only have about five verses up there. So you can read it easily. What we often do in our life, we try to crowd too much into too little space. So we say, well might be better if you had more scripture up there, maybe give the background, the context, maybe have the whole chapter up there, we can see what's going on over here. What does it look like? Oh, that's not too healthy is it? Unless you have magnifying glass, you can't read all that. What happens when we try to do too much, we do too little, we lose our effectiveness. And so it's much better to take a few verses and look at that, and leave that margin there. And so looking at the story of Mary and Martha, we see an individual in particular with Martha who did not have enough margin. And she allowed the stress and train strains of life and all the rugged activities that have to be done. to crowd out the most important thing, she had the opportunity to sit at Jesus feet, to know the one who brought her into this world. And it gives her life and meaning. So let's go ahead for the remainder of the lesson this morning, talk about what's the biblical response to a let me forget this point here. So one of the things that we have to realize, as we try to create profit margin in our lives, is that for example, you can't read every devotional email that comes into inbox, I get lots and lots and lots and lots of though you can't read them all. And I get Gary Henry's word points. And I can't read everyone every day. And you can't read every newspaper or online article. You can't go every place you want to go in this world. You can't eat everything you want to eat, sometimes those potluck get togethers that we do from time to time, I want to have a little bit of everything. And if I miss it, I go back and try it again, a little bit of everything. Can't do that. You can't see every vacation spot that there is you can't read every book that's ever been written. And the famous song circle of life, that Elton John sings a song, there's more to see than can ever be seen, more to do than ever can be done. So you have to have margin, you have to have limitations, you have to set priorities. And so when we look we so that's a realization that sometimes it's hard for us to to reach that level of

Mike Roy  12:35
understanding that we can't do everything that we simply want to do. So we've got to establish some priorities. So the question is, what is the biblical response? What does the Bible have to say about margin and how we can we can create margin in our lives? Well, there are a couple of things I want to talk about. First of all, I really these three main things. Number one, come to Jesus, if we need to create margin our lives come to Jesus, we just sang that song this morning. So the text in Matthew chapter 11, says this, come to me all you who are weary and heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your souls for my yoke is easy, and my burden is light. So look at what Jesus is promising over here. If he raised the question, what did Jesus promise to give to anyone who comes to Him is going to give forgiveness. Because this text doesn't really say that specifically, or wash away our sins. He will do all that. But he's what he said was, I will give you rest, rest from your labors, rest from your worries, restaurants, all your busy activities of life, curse and that rest includes forgiveness. It includes salvation, and includes cleansing from sin. But what does it also include include it includes peace of mind, I need more peace of mind to be honest with you. You probably do too, includes rest from our busy worried, harried lives that we live. So this is so if we want to create margin need to create more margin in our lives, rarely come to Jesus sit as sit at Jesus feet, as Mary did, and listen to what most of what's most important in our lives. And I will say this, thinking about maybe if someone who's not obeyed the gospel of Christ, certainly come to Jesus obey the gospel, embrace God's word be born again. That's certainly true. I trust it. Probably most everybody here has done that. That's why we've all obeyed the gospel of Christ, haven't we and committed our lives to Jesus Christ. So what we need to do from this text, come back to Jesus, come back and sit at his feet, listen to his words, come back to his teaching, come back to his holiness. If it'll cost us to turn off the television, do other stuff that occupies our time, come back to his mercy, come back to his grace, come back to his love, come back to the Word of God. So if we need to create margin in our lives, come back come to Jesus, as we sing this morning. Secondly, I want to suggest that if we want to create margin in our lives, apply the teaching, and First John tempted to do not love the world. So here's the text of the Scripture up over here. And First John chapter two, verses 15, through 17. John says, Do not love the world are the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him. For all that is in the world, the desires of the flesh, and the desires of the eyes and pride of life is not from the Father, but is from the world. And the world is passing away along with his desires. But whoever does the will of God abides forever. So what John is saying to Christians, to you and to me, Do not love the world.

Mike Roy  16:23
The world is full of junk, things, too much stuff, too many distractions, we get into trouble when we do that. We need more margin in our life, don't be enticed by the world. It can't save you can't help you is futility as we've been studying the book of Ecclesiastes. So John is screaming to us Do not love the world. And what do we do? We go out there and we love the world. We go to the games we get on television, we do we buy all this stuff, we want more property, has there ever been a more materialistic time in life? Maybe there has been, but maybe it's just the nature of humanity. So John is reminding us that we need to apply this command don't love the world, the world is filled with all the deceptions, the desires of the flesh, the desires of the eyes, the pride of life, this is not from God, or from God, this is from the world, this is from the devil. And so John reminds us not to love the world. And in order to do that, in order to build margin, this is hard to do. I certainly don't do a great job with it, many of us probably don't. But in order to build margin or live, sometimes what we have to do is be radical, make some radical choices. And the reason that we don't have margin because we're not willing to do those things. So creating margin requires some radical choices. For example, I've talked about this from time to time, turn off the television, the television tends to dominate our lives, watching. And it's not like there's a particular program or maybe some important game that we want to watch. But we turn it on set. I wonder what's on television? Well, it's a zillion things are on television, if I've have you watched one thing, then a trailer comes across and gets your attention, you want to watch that. And before long, he spent the whole evening in mindless activity. And so turn, in fact, another thing you could do. I know a number of New Testament Christians like ourselves, who have gotten rid of their television, oh, that is such a radical decision, that maybe the quality of life is better, maybe they have more margin. Put down your phone when you're with other people. Boy, we all guilty of that one. Again, these are some suggestions Get to bed on time. We're also tired, I'm tired, you're tired, we are so tired. Get enough sleep. One of the problems we don't have, we don't get enough sleep we get so much to do. I'm trying to pay bills and get to work overtime. We understand that. But creating margins requires making radical choices. Give the Bible reading your highest priority. Make prayer, your highest priority, make the worship of God, your highest priority. So when we do these things, it creates margin in our lives. And that means we need to learn to say no to things of lesser importance. I don't have to watch that program. I don't have to go here. I don't have to do that. I've already got a million things on my plate. We say Well, I'm just gonna maximize my time. Well, we don't want to certainly do that. But we have to have margin. We understand that God understands that we'll see that Jesus life here in just a minute. But the point I'm making is that creating margin requires sometimes radical choices that are not popular. Not easy to do for you or for me or for anyone. But if you want to have margin and you need to have margin, God knows that you need to have margin and if we don't take some of these steps, we heard ourselves, again is our margin decreases, our stress increases, who wants more stress? Not me. So that means we got to find a way to increase our margin so that the second point I'm making there, don't love the world, the world has nothing to offer you. Thirdly, I want to suggest again by way of a practical command from scripture, be still we sing the songs, Be still and know God. That's what you need. That's what I need. Be still and not not just know who he is. Know Him, love Him, serve Him have His Word so impressed into your heart and mind that it changes who you are. So Psalm chapter 46, verses eight through 11, especially knows firsthand, the Psalmist says, Be still and know that I am God do you need margin in your life?

Mike Roy  20:55
Be still, that's the hardest thing for me, the lot of things I struggle with, just being still is a hard, hard thing to do. It maybe it's human nature, I've got a stack of paperwork on my kitchen table, which is not pretty to look at. But it's easier for me to drive someplace and see your customer and drop off a sample or pick up a check. That's a fun thing to do, rather than just be still and take some care of some business at hand or just not be overwhelmed with all that, that paperwork. But but that's the principle be still in no. As their script, the writer says that I am God. So in the context how this Psalm was tell us to do that says copyhold, the works of the Lord, how he is brought desolations on the earth, He makes war sees to the end of the earth, He breaks the bow and shatters the spear, he burns the chariot with fire. So if you want to remind yourself who God is, look at what he's done throughout history. And all of the the kings and the generals that he's brought to the dust of the earth and overthrew them in his kingdom prevails, but all the kingdoms of the earth have come to an end or will come to an end. So when we remember what all the works that God has done, it helps us to, to realize his power, we see his power creation. In verse 10. He said, I will be exalted among the nations, I will be exalted in the earth. So when we are still in come to know God, well, we understand that there is no one might God, no one, in any capacity. And then in addition to that, the last thing this Psalm, The psalmist, says in verse 11, that this great and powerful and awesome God who has done all these incredible works, in his fashion, creation, for His glory, for our enjoyment, the Lord of hosts is with us, the Lord of Heaven's Armies, is with me, I can win any battle in life. Sometimes I don't, because I try to go it alone. But the Lord of Heaven's Armies is with you in your battle, in your stress, in your margin, Lis life. And so realize that the God of Jacob is our fortress. And so it's a reminder that if we are going to create margin in our lives, we need to be still just need to be so sometimes be still, maybe this week is a challenge. You know, take one day in desperate for 10 minutes, don't do anything, just contemplate God, just look at the can look, the sky, look at the lake that you might be, you can see from your office window, if you have an ideal work setting. Maybe not. Well go find it go go by the lake, like I'm driving longer gonna put Oh, look at that lake, stop my truck. Look at a verse of Scripture, do something like that. And so we simply need to be still and know God. So God knows that we need to be still and know who he is. Jesus knows all about that. And Jesus shows us. So let me look at one of the Scripture. And we're going to be looking at and Mark chapter one. And verses 30 to 35. So Jesus himself teaches us how to have Martin that's always the question. How do you do I know what you're saying, Mike, I agree with what you're saying. How do I do it? Well, Jesus teaches it. So look at Mark chapter one, verses 30 to 35. This is the end of a very busy day. There isn't anybody in this room, who's lived a busier life and Jesus did has in verse 32, said that that evening, so after the day is over, at evenings at sundown, they brought to him all who were sick or oppressed by demons. Wow. You can see the throng of people in the whole city was gathered together at the door. And he healed many who were sick with various diseases and cast up many demons and he would not permit the demons to speak because they knew him Wow, what an incredibly busy day you talk about the stress and strain and everybody in your brother is begging Jesus for healing, and all this type of thing. How did Jesus create margin in his life, like in verse 35, and rising very early the next morning, while it was still dark, and I was sound asleep, and you were sound asleep, he departed and went out to a desolate place. And he prayed there. That's how Jesus created margin. Most of the time, we prayer we say, I'm just gonna go with this other room or just bow my head briefly.

Mike Roy  25:45
But the we do that, before his day got going, he went out to the wilderness, and found a quiet, deserted place with nobody there, no cell phones, no emails, nothing like that no Wi Fi. He got along with God. That's how we create mark is not easy. But Jesus teaches us how to do so this is the beginning of another busy day. And look at the text in verse 35. And we just looked at this. So rising very early, early in the morning, while it was still dark, he departed and went to a decimal place and prayed there. And Simon, and those who were with him, were with him search for him, and they found him. So now Jesus gets this quiet place of margin and alone time with God. And Simon says, Lord, everybody is looking for you. Where have you been? There's a million people who want healing, they want food for their bellies. And it's amazing what he did verse 38, he said to them, and it's 1000 people trying to get to Jesus right now. He said, Let us go on to the next town that I may preach there also for this, why it came out. We like the accolades of people, we like the attention, Jesus walked away from the masses of people who are swarming around them. And they wanted to belly fed with food, they didn't want the food from heaven. You said, I'm going someplace else. Wow. And then, and verse 39, he went out throughout all Galilee, preaching in their synagogues and casting out demons, Jesus lived an incredibly busy life, all types of activities, characterizes his life, but Jesus created margin in his life. So the question is, Where did Jesus get his strength in his determination from he got it from his father, Father, he got it from the scriptures, which were part of his mind. But Jesus gave himself he created margin. And until we do that, brother, we can struggle with stress, and difficulty and frustration and worry and anxiety and all these other things. And the point is, Jesus gave himself healthy margins, you can too, and I can too. So I hope this morning that we realize the urgency of creating proper margin in our lives, it's vital to our physical, our spiritual and emotional well being the solution as we extend, extend the invitation song is come to Jesus, if you're here this morning, and you've not obeyed the gospel of Christ, the first thing that you need to do, especially if you want to develop margin as obey the gospel of Christ through faith and repentance, and submitting to God's command, to be baptized in water to be immersed into Christ for the forgiveness of your sins. And maybe that you've done that and you just need the prayers of his congregation at the end here who need to respond in any way you might come up with stand and sing this song
