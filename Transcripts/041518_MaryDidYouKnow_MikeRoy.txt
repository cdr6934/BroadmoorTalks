So wonderful opportunity, that we have to come and worship right God to give praise to His holy name to sing the songs that reflect His power, His love, His kindness and all the characteristics of our holy God is a privilege to worship God to also to speak His word and a way that we can be challenged to develop the kind of faith that we need to have appreciate those songs that chance led this morning to prayer, appreciate the words that norm shared at the Lord's Supper, we need to be thinking about course, Jesus Christ and His life and the sacrifices that he made. Think about the other people around the cross, and who have manifested a great degree of faith, and humility and trust to be a part of God's will. Gonna be talking this morning about Mary and is one of the most remarkable characters really in all the Bible in the last several years. Excuse me. The last several years has been, I'm calling it an explosion of songs, worship songs that we have had a chance to use in our worship. Years ago, I downloaded a song called Mary did you know, and maybe you know that song, maybe you don't. It's a powerful song, as you listen to the words of that song reminds us of the humility of Mary her faith or trust her obedience. But the songs that we've been singing continue to add to our, our list of songs are powerful, they keep us I think, in touch with scripture may be bringing old truths to light. And so this morning, I want to talk about that with you this in our lesson, and to really focusing on Mary so often in Scripture, we think about great Bible heroes of faith, Abraham, or Isaac, or Jacob, or Daniel, or Paul, or whoever it may be. But there are a lot of women in the Bible who have who have demonstrated remarkable faith, in the midst of extremely difficult circumstances, not knowing really how everything would play out in that person's life, Mary is one of them. And so this morning, we're talking about Mary. And it's really to appreciate what she has done in her life, the fate that she manifested to set her forth as an example, for all of us, especially for those who are women, and maybe to appreciate our wives, our daughters. Our mothers are single ladies in our congregation, there's so much that we can all do in God's kingdom. Mary, in my opinion, present represents perhaps some of the greatest faith and obedience of anybody in Scripture. So let's talk about heard this morning. As we get into our text, I want to share with you first the words to this song. And maybe at some point, some of our song leaders can do some research on this and incorporate that into our worship as well. But this is how the song goes, says Mary, did you know that your baby boy would one day walk on water? Mary, did you know that your baby boy would save our sons and daughters? Did you know that your baby boy has come to make you knew this child that you've delivered will soon deliver you married? Did you know that your baby boy will give sight to a blind man? Married? Did you know that your baby boy will calm a storm with his hand? Did you know that your baby your baby boy has walked where angels trod and when you kiss your little baby, you kiss the face of God. The blind will see the deaf will hear the dead will live again. The lame will leap the dumb will speak the praises of the lamb. Mary did you know that your baby boy, the one that you're holding in your arm is Lord of all creation? Mary did you know that your baby boy would one day rule the nation's Did you know that your baby boy is heavens perfect lamb. That sleeping child you're holding is the great I Am the Mary know that she was holding the eternally existent one. The one who spoke the world into existence by the power of His word. Don't know all of what she knew. But there lots of questions here. So let's focus. I'm using that song just to generate some thinking for each of us to into ultimately appreciate

the magnitude of Mary's faith, the level of humility and trust and obedience that she displayed in a situation that would be hard for any human to comprehend. And so let's go ahead if you've got your Bibles open I want to read in Luke chapter one verses 2060 30 He ate. There's so much we can talk about and appreciate norm already sharing some scriptures. But in Luke chapter one, in verses 26 to 38, this is where the birth of Jesus is foretold, I'm going to be reading from the ESV. It says in the sixth month, the angel Gabriel was sent from God to a city of Galilee, Galilee named Nazareth, to a virgin betrothed to a man named whose name was Joseph of the house of David. And the virgin's name was Mary. And he came to her and said, Greetings, oh, favorite one, the Lord is with you. But she was greatly troubled at the saying and tried to discern what discern what sort of greeting this might be. And the angel said to her, Do not be afraid, Mary, For you have found favor with God. And behold, you will conceive in your womb and bear a son, you shall call his name Jesus, he will be called great, it will be called the Son, He will be great, it will be called the Son of the Most High, and the Lord God will give him the throne of his father David, and he will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and of His kingdom, there will be no end. Verse 34, Mary said to the angel, How will this be, since I am a virgin? And the angel answered her, the Holy Spirit will come upon you, and the power of the Most High will overshadow you, therefore the child to be born will be called holy, the Son of God. And behold, your relative Elizabeth, in her old age has also conceived the sun. And this is the sixth month with her who was called barren, for nothing will be impossible with God. You have to look at verse 38. And imagine if you're young virgin, girl, and mess with at that time, and Mary said, Behold, I am the servant of the Lord. Let it be to me according to your word. And the angel departed from her. To me, this is one of the most compelling sections in all of Scripture that manifest a faith on Mary's part that is that is difficult to comprehend in many ways. And so I want you to just think about what we just read. And and the first thing I want you to recognize that she had a, no doubt 1000 Questions swirling through her mind as this angel Gabriel came to hit her and said, you know, Hello, Mary, Hail Mary, you're highly favored by God, you're gonna give birth to a son? And yet you're a virgin? She had no, no doubt all types of questions running through her mind. The first question she might ask is, why me? Why? Why did you choose me? Aren't there other people out here that can accomplish God's will? Couldn't God use somebody else? How did I find such favor from God? Lots of questions. And then the question, How am I going to conceive since I'm a virgin. It's never happened in the history of the world. That A virgin would give birth to a child by the power of the Holy Spirit. This has never happened, ever. So all kinds of questions would be running through her mind. And I'd say that Mary couldn't possibly know the full implications of her decision to obey God, yet she acted in complete faith, a pastor that norm made reference to just a little while ago, and Luke chapter two verses 34 and 35. And Simeon said that Behold, that, that this man, this, this, this Savior, is set for the rise and fall of many in Israel, and that he will be assigned to be opposed, and a sword will pierce your own soul. And all the things that would happen in Jesus life, maybe Mary understood some of those things, it'd be hard to understand that she that she knew all of that. But when when the angel Gabriel comes to her with this promise, again, this remarkable faith on her part, it reminds me of Abraham, that Mary certainly didn't know everything that would take place in her life, or in a life, maybe even of Jesus but says, well, Abraham, that when he was called, he obeyed, and by going out to a place which he was to receive for an inheritance, and he went out, this was Abraham, not knowing where he was going.

Mike Roy  09:38
So Mary's faith is that cloud of Abraham, she doesn't know exactly how's this going to happen? She just doesn't know. She has. She's struggling to understand why me why this grace showered upon me, how is this going to happen? I don't know, man. How is this going to take place? So her faith is like Abraham, and she obeyed God even though she didn't understand what that meant, or, or fully, so that that's just one of the elements. Think about this as well before we go back to our text, the shame of a pregnancy outside of wedlock would have been enormous for any woman to be thinking about. So verse 29, of the Texas that Mary was greatly troubled at the angels grading, greatly troubled, she's in anguish. The pastor that norm read in Luke chapter two, verse 19, that Mary treasured these things in our hearts. And she pondered them. She was thinking about all this in verse 34. She said, again, how can this be since I am a virgin? So lots of questions, lots of uncertainty. But again, think about the shame of a woman giving birth to a son who's not married. Think about the shame that a person would have to deal with in that culture. Know, the Old Testament penalty for sex outside of marriage was was death by stoning. I wonder. The Mary thinks she would die. I don't know. The Mary thing that somebody in the Jewish culture, the leaders would put her to death. She had a child, not Joseph's child. She had a lot in her mind, that she's thinking about the fact that Matthew chapter one, verse 19, it says that her husband, Joseph, who was a righteous man, it was unwilling to put her to shame. Resolved to divorce her quietly. So Joseph, apparently thought that maybe Mary had been given him to sin. So he's trying to avoid the shame, the embarrassment that she might go through? I don't know. I'm just raising lots of questions. But again, think about that the thoughts that will be racing through her mind me, I'm a virgin, I'm going to give birth to a son. I'm not even married. How do I explain that? How do I explain that to my friends, my family? What about the law, all those thoughts racing through her mind, and then she's pondering the consternation and embarrassment that Joseph would experience since she has a child and he marries her and it's not his child? What's going through his mind what's going through her mind? And think about the rest of her reputation? And her social status? Again, never in history, has a virgin? Who has a woman, much less a virgin conceived the child by the power of the Holy Spirit? And so the question is, who's going to believe this? There's just so many questions. And a big question of the fear of shame, certainly, would have been one that Mary thought about. But you think about this, before we go back to our text, I'm gonna put the scriptures on the screen. Think about this, Mary was given the perhaps the highest honor and privilege of by giving birth to the Savior of all mankind. So she's given the promise you're gonna give birth to the Savior of the world. I asked him a question to the women in our congregation. If God came to you and said that to you that you're gonna give birth to the Savior of all humanity. What would you say?

Mike Roy  13:17
Especially if you're single, you're not married, don't have any children. You're gonna give birth to the Savior of all mankind? Would you step up to the plate and said, I'm ready? I'll do it. The question was world. And I suggest, again, that married display perhaps the greatest level of humility and trust, of any Bible character are as great as any of them. And so when you think about their this situation, it's hard to fathom what was going through her mind at this time yet, we'll go back to the text and see that Mary was a person of faith and obedience. She She did what God told her to do. I like this comment from Wilson Adams in a workbook that carries us and for the women, that there is no evidence that she that Mary brooded over the consequences to her reputation. She did not let that stop her from from stepping up to the plate and being the one who gives birth to the savior of the of the world. And so what we see here is her submission to her father's will, is one of profound humidity and faith. And so again, looking back here at the text, and verse 30, Asa, behold, even your relative Elizabeth has also conceived the sun in her old age, and she who was called barren is now in our sixth month, for nothing will be impossible for God. So one of the reasons one of the proofs that God's giving Mary would that Gabriel is giving Mary that this is going to happen. He said that your your cousin, your relative, Elizabeth, who's and who was barren, is going to give birth to a child late in her life, and nothing will be impossible to with God. And then in verse 38, Mary said, Behold, this is her response. Behold the bond slave of the Lord this in the New American Standard versus the servant of the Lord. When the Apostle Paul described himself in his work of preaching and writing these letters, he said, I am a bond servant of Jesus Christ. Mary said, I'm a bond slave of Almighty God. Wow. And sometimes we think that women can't accomplish much in God's kingdom. So she said, Behold, the bond slave of the Lord may be done to me according to your word. So there's nothing recorded of any hesitation, any doubt, any desire to get away, get out of that situation. And she just completely submitted to doing her father's will. And not not giving into fear or insecurity or anything like that. The New International Version puts it this way. In verse 38, she said, I am the LORD servant, Mary answered me your word to me be fulfilled. So I say this, to say about Mary, she, in this situation, she manifested a degree of humility and trust in obedience. That is hard some ways to even comprehend. And the point I want to make the main point of this, this particular lesson is that we need to respect appreciate and imitate this godly woman. And I'll make some comments and our culture, our religious culture, I'm this ban, the eras of Catholicism, I came out of the Catholic Church, and as Mary has been venerated, people pray to her. And that's not something that we need to do, that we need to do. And sometimes when we talk about Mary, that becomes the focus of the talk, that we don't want to pray to her. We don't want to venerate her. But the message is, Mary is a woman of remarkable faith that she is an example of humility and trust and obedience for every single Christian today, if she did, so, it would be very difficult circumstance and not knowing what's going to take place there. And so she is a tremendous role model. And so really suggesting to us that this morning that Mary is worthy of our appreciation, she's worthy of our respect, and she's worthy of our imitation, that we should imitate that level of humility, that we can imitate that trust, we can imitate that obedience, even when we may have a lot of questions about how God's going to accomplish this purposes. And so let me go back and look at verses 46 Down to verse 56, of Luke chapter one. And this is again, I've never pronounced this word correctly, the Magnificat that Mary make but but what you have in this, this these statements here is a statement of faith and trust that Mary believed what Gabriel said she believed God and she knew that it was going to come to pass.

Mike Roy  17:56
In verse 46, or seven, Mary said, My soul exalts the Lord, and my spirit has has rejoiced in God my Savior, for he is, for he has had regard for the humble state of his bond slave, for behold, From this time on, all generations will count me blessed. For the Mighty One has done great things for me, and holy is his name. And his mercy is upon generation after generation toward those who fear him. He has done mighty deeds with his arm, he has scattered those who are proud of the thought and the thoughts of their heart. He has brought down rulers from the throne, CZ, and he is a he has exalted those who are humbled, he has filled the hungry with good things, and sent the way the rich, empty handed, he has given help to Israel, his servant, in remembrance of his mercy as he spoke to our fathers to Abraham, and his descendants forever. And she was saying, as we sang that song, God will take care of you, God will fulfill his promises, even if it doesn't make sense to you, even if you don't understand what's going to happen around the next bend of the river, so to speak, God will provide and that's what Mary is shouting, in spite of all the uncertainty and the question that swirled in her mind, she believed that God would take care of her. So some lessons I want to leave us with this morning. These are important lessons for all of us, but especially for women. First of all, we need to remind ourselves that women play a vital role in God's kingdom. And our society. We we think about the work of preachers and elders and, and, and people like that. And sometimes a woman thinks, Well, I'm never going to be a preacher. I'm not going to be an elder, but no women can do remarkable things in God's kingdom. And we need to need to recognize that and I think from a practical standpoint, in our prayers, brethren, our public prayers, especially are we going to do we thank God for our wives. Do we thank God for our children? We thank God for our mothers. We thank God for the single Christian ladies have been teaching class. For years and years, women have a vital role to play in God's kingdom. Secondly, teach as a mother, perhaps teach your own children, the will of God, the Word of God, that's something that you can do. saving our children's Souls is important, it should be high on our list, obviously, we can teach other children and a lot of women in this congregation have been teaching children for a long, long time. This is a way that you can glorify God, as a woman in God's kingdom. You can teach other women God's word, we've got a number of women in this congregation who teach other women on a somewhat regular basis. So these are things that can be done. And I think all of us need to we need to recognize that we are faithful stewards, that's been our theme this year, right? And so oftentimes, I think, as a teacher, or preacher or whatever, then I'm accountable for the gifts that God has given me. And that's true, that's true for all of us. But I'm just raising the question, do we sometimes think that stewardship is something that just applies to men? It doesn't, that women have to be women are accountable for the gifts that that they've been given. And so need to recognize that all of us, all of us have been given gifts, and no, you're not the preacher. But you're a woman made in God's image, you glorify Him the way that he made you. And so that's something that we've been focusing on this year, being faithful stewards, so as a woman in God's kingdom, need to remind yourself to be a faithful steward of what God has entrusted to you. And then recognize that your example inspires all of us, both men and women. So yes, I'm inspired by Abraham's faith, the tremendous faith that he had to serve God, but I'm inspired by Sarah's faith. I'm inspired by Hannah's faith in the Old Testament, what a woman have tremendous faith, amazing faith. And again,

Mike Roy  21:54
she can't have a baby her, her adversary, who's married to her husband is taunting her. And yet she pours out her heart to God, she's trust God, and God again, brings her the child that she is desiring. So throughout Scripture, you see examples of women playing key roles in God's kingdom effect. If you read Romans chapter 16. Most of that book, and most of that chapter is a chapter where Paul is specifying all the godly women who have helped him in his ministry, and the difference that they've made in the church that met in so and so's home, the woman's home. So we get this mindset that I'm not a woman, I'm not a man. So I can't do much in God's kingdom. And that's not true, this loss that can be done. And so, when we think about Mary, in spite of all of her unanswered questions, Mary responded in faith, she was fully obedient to the angels promise. And again, we recognize that we appreciate her. We respect her, we certainly need to imitate her faith. And no, we don't venerate Mary, we don't pray to Mary. And the, I guess one of the great ironies that Mary would be appalled to think about people around the world praying to her, she never wanted, that. She was just an obedient servant of God doing what God told her to do. But she is a great example for all of us. And so my prayer and wish for each of us this morning is that God would be glorified through the faith and obedience of faithful servants like Mary and so many other Bible heroes of faith. But here's the real challenge for each of us this morning. It really is to pray that God would be glorified through your faith and through your obedience in my eyes bow. So Christian, do you know what God can accomplish through you? If we don't get paralyzed by the questions like Why me? How can God use me? Why Can't God use somebody else? No, God uses each of us as we step forward in faith, humility and trust, seeking to do His will. So I hope that you'll be encouraged by the lesson this morning to think about people like Mary and so many others in the Bible, women who manifested tremendous faith, a profound sense of humility. And these were people who who obeyed exactly what God had told to them, and so hope that the lesson will be encouragement to each of us. Our challenge is indeed, when we hear God's word to respond to it and faith and that means to become a Christian. We have to believe that Jesus is the Messiah, we must be willing to repent of our sins, confess our faith in Him. And yes, we must submit the God's command to be baptized or immersed in wallet for the forgiveness of our sins. If there's any here this morning, who needs to respond to this invitation? We invite you to come forward while we're standing as saying the invitation song
