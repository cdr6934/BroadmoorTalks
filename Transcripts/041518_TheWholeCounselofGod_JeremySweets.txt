Good evening. Good to see everyone here tonight. Certainly good that we can gather together to worship our God and appreciate the songs that were led and the prayers that were led as we worship God tonight, if you're visiting with us, we want you to know that you are honored, get our honored guests. We're glad that you're here. And we invite you to continue in our worship. This hour, we're going to be opening up our Bibles and studying from his word. In fact, go ahead and open to Acts chapter 20. Acts chapter 20. You know, there are many times in fact, most times when a partial job is just not good enough, I asked my kids to unload the dishwasher, you know how it has two shells, they come back and only unload one of those and say, that's not good enough, we need to clear the entire dishwasher. If I'm at work, and I get a job to do a report, if I give half of the report or only look at half of the hospitals that we're looking at, that's not going to be good enough. I said, No, go back and make sure the whole thing is there. If you get your paycheck, and it's only half of what it's supposed to be, then that's probably not going to work for you as well. When we look at Acts chapter 20. The same thing applies really to Paul, when he talks about preaching the word of God. It was his desire and his goal that he would not preach part of God's word or a partial gospel. But his desire was to preach the entire Gospel or the whole counsel of God. In Acts chapter 20, we see in verses 18, through 38, or 17, through 38, that Paul addresses the Ephesian elders, he addresses the Ephesian elders. And you'll notice several things that he says to them. But one of those he says in verse 25, is the fact that this may be my last address here. And I may not see you face to face again. Notice in Acts 20, and verse 25. He says, And now behold, I know that none of you among whom I have gone about proclaiming the kingdom of Kingdom will see my face again. Therefore, I testify to you this day that I am innocent of the blood of all, fried did not shrink from the cleanse you the whole counsel of God. Paul says, I may not see you again, face to face, but I'm innocent when it comes to my preaching, because I have preached to you everything. I have preached you the whole counsel of God, that was Paul's goal. That was what he was desiring to do. Earlier in verse 20, he uses the phrase that I did not shrink from declaring to you anything that was profitable, everything that is good for you everything that is needed, and everything that is necessary, Paul says, I preached that to you. Now, by implication here, if he had failed to do that, he would be guilty, or he would be accountable for his failure to preach the entire Word of God.

Jeremy Sweets  03:13
I'll speak for myself, I think I can speak for Mike and Conrad and really all the elders and all those that address God's word publicly on a regular basis. That's one of the most difficult things that I do, is striving to preach the whole counsel of God. So sometimes, really, that comes down to sermon selection, trying to address what the congregation needs trying to look at, and everything that I can. I don't think Paul meant that he went verse by verse and covered every single lawn, I'm not sure that that's, I'm pretty sure that's not what he's talking about. But what he is saying is that he, he preached the entire Gospel, the whole gospel, he didn't shrink away, he didn't. He didn't decide for fear of how others might react that he is going to hold this part back. And so as Christians today, we need to have the same attitude of preaching, proclaiming, practicing the whole counsel of God. I mentioned that it does not involve I think, going exactly line by line. But in general, the list I have in my mind is I wrote down here preaching the whole counsel of God involves preaching a complete gospel, and that includes preaching and talking about God's mighty deeds and scripture, and talking about the story of Scripture. That includes addressing human sin and the need for repentance. That involves talking about the life and teaching of Jesus Christ and God throughout the scriptures. That involves and talking about the atoning death of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins. That includes the requirements for response Adding to the gospel that includes righteous and holy living. And it also needs to include the judgment, including Heaven and Hell. Those are some broad categories. But if we're to preach the whole counsel of God, then we need to be preaching and teaching on all of these subjects. And so that's something that I want to look at tonight and address. As we talk about the whole counsel of God. I mentioned already that Paul was talking about his preaching of the whole counsel of God. He mentioned that here, not only to the Ephesian elders, but I believe that was his goal, that he would not leave out anything that was vital, anything that was important. He didn't want to be held accountable in that regard. And so his goal was to preach the whole counsel of God. That should be our goal as well. I know that's Mike's and Connor as mine again, the elders, any faithful preacher that stands in the pulpit on a regular basis is seeking to preach the whole counsel of God. And we need to be seeking that today as well. Notice if you would in Second Timothy chapter four. Second Timothy, chapter four, as we look at Paul's final address his farewell, we see what he says as he reflects toward the end of his life, the charges that he makes to Timothy.

Jeremy Sweets  06:29
In Second Timothy four starting in verse one, he says, I charge you in the presence of God and of Christ Jesus, who is the judge the living and the dead, and by His appearing in his kingdom, preach the Word. Be ready in season and out of season. reprove, rebuke, exhort with complete patience and teaching. For the time is coming when people will not endure sound teaching, but having itching ears, they will accumulate for themselves, teachers to suit their own passions, and will turn away from listening to the truth and wander off into myths. As for you always be sober minded, and you're suffering, do the work of an evangelist, fulfill your ministry will stop there. Notice that his charge and the charge that he brings before God is to preach the Word. Now know that's a simple instruction. But in application, it becomes much more difficult. Preach the Word, He says to do that, in season and out of season. Do that when people like it, and when people don't like it, do it when people are favorable to the message. And when people are unfavorable to the message. Do that when it's popular, and when it's not. The goal is to preach the Word and there's an idea of than an unwavering commitment here, preach the Word, Preach it regardless of how people will respond or react. The goal is to preach the Word. He goes on to talk about some difficulties when preaching the Word. He says For the time will come when people will not endure sound doctrine. When you preach sometimes there are those that Amen. And they say I agree with that. That is a true message. But sometimes when you preach, that will not be the case. In fact, people will not want to hear sound doctrine. Because sound doctrine often makes people uncomfortable. It often requires them to do things that they don't want to do, or to give up things that they don't want to give up. And it can be an uncomfortable message. We don't want to hear words of sin, and how sin is in our lives. We don't hear want to hear words of judgment and how judgment is coming. And the text here says that people will come and notice what it says they will have itching ears, and they'll accumulate for themselves teachers to suit their own passions. And so those that listen to the word will get teachers that will tell them what they want to hear. So in light of that, as Paul saying, you're going to have to adjust your message every so often to make sure that you're pleasing to whoever you're talking to. Is that what he's saying? Just the opposite, isn't it? He says in spite of that, in spite of their desire, you preach the Word. reprove, rebuke, exhort with great patience and instruction, preach the Word. And that is what is needed today. That we would preach the word not leaving some out because that's what others want, but instead preaching the Word. And it says here in verse four, that they will turn away from listening to the truth and will wander off into myths. Paul says preach the Word, preached the Word and that's what we need to do today as well. I reminded all throughout Scripture that this has been a problem in Jeremiah in the final days of the kingdoms of kingdom of Judah. We see that they were headed into judgment. But there were some prophets there that were saying peace, peace. And the text says they were giving, healing the brokenness of my people superficially. They were promising healing, but it wasn't a true healing. They were promising a message of peace, when that was not actually the case. And so the people were telling others what they wanted to hear, everyone wants to hear that things are going to be alright. But in the final days of Judah, that was not the case. That was not the message that was needed. And so it was a false message. Paul's charges we think back to Second Timothy, Chapter Four is a charge that still stands today. It's a charge that preachers still need to hear today. And you'll notice that this message is not only for preachers, but as we see in Second Timothy four, also those that demand preaching are those that would listen to preaching. And so that's you. What will you demand of preaching? What will you require that the preacher do be faithful to the Word or tell you what is pleasing to your ear? And so we all have a responsibility in this, don't we, that we would preach the word? Well, if we're going to preach the word today, a few things that I thought of is that we're going to need to avoid the buffet style of religion. You've seen in this country that we are a consumer culture, that is that we choose and pick what we want. It's not dictated to us by the government, there's no situation where we have to buy this or that, but rather, in general, we have a choice as consumers. And many people have brought that into their religion so that they can pick and choose what they would like to do. You may have heard some people, I've heard this term, and it seems contradictory to me a Buddhist Christian sews that will try to merge the practices, I liked the meditation that's involved in Buddhism, and I like some of the good teachings over here. And so I'm gonna take that, and I'm just gonna, I'm gonna do whatever I would like. And many people approach God and spirituality in those terms. And that has completely flipped the script, isn't it, that has made religion about me and what I want, instead of submitting to what God wants. And so if we're going to preach the whole counsel of God, we're not going to try to have this buffet style where you come and choose and pick what you want. And we're not going to present that as preachers as well. We're also going to identify culturally accepted sins, there are certain sins that their culture simply accepts, says, well, that's okay. You know, it's not a big deal. If you live together before marriage, it's not a big deal. If, if you fall out of love and marriage, and you need to go marry multiple times, that's not a problem in our culture. It's not a problem in our culture, that that abortion happens on a regular basis. It's not a problem in our culture that, that

Jeremy Sweets  13:18
I'll have one item and it just left me. I'm gonna have to find my notes. I was really going there. Homosexuality, fornication, sanctity of marriage. Okay. So there are many things. There are many things in our society, that they just simply accepted and said, It's okay. If we're going to be preaching the whole counsel of God, we can't shy away from those. Yes, it is true that the world says that homosexuality is not a sin, and that we should accept that. As preachers, we have to be careful how we address that we can't elevate that as sin above all others, and say, That's the chief of sins, which is not the case. And so we have to be careful in how we address it. But we can't pull back and say, I'm not going to talk about it. I'm not going to address it. And so we have to identify even things that the culture accepts. We also have to let scripture determine our teaching and not our religious neighbors. Yes, we need to address the teaching of our religious neighbors. From time to time, we'll have to compare the teaching that we hear and we're gonna have to take Scripture and we're going to have to compare those and address that. That's going to be needed from time to time. But we can't let our religious neighbors or anyone else for that matter, determine or dictate what it is we're going to focus on or teach Mike even address that this morning. The Catholic Church has a doctrine or teaching on Mary and we need to talk about that and address that but we can allow the Catholic Church to the detract from our teaching of Mary and who she is, you understand what I'm saying there. And so we can't let people that focus on a particular that can't become our main focus. So how do we determine what our main focus is? Is it by looking over here at this church and saying, Well, we're not going to do what they're doing? Now it's scripture. What does Scripture emphasize? What does Scripture teach? What does scripture say we need to be focused on? Now we are going to have to address others as I mentioned, but scripture needs to be pushing the agenda, you see that it needs to be pushing the agenda. So the world will as many teachings on for example, the Holy Spirit, well, we can avoid that subject or talk topic. The world often praises God and we might think that is twisted in some ways is the manner they go about that we can't let that stop us from praising God. And so we need to be a people that that is driven by the book, in our teaching, and in what we teach and how we teach, driven by scripture, driven by Scripture. We also need to avoid hobby horses. Now, this is a term I haven't heard in a long time. As I look back two periodicals at a time but past, this was something that was often criticized a hobby horse you may think of a little child on a stick horse riding that horse. So hobbyhorse is when you select one topic from God's word, and you give it a in ordinate position so that you focus only and exclusively on that. I've seen this happen many times, for example, maybe in Revelation where where some teachings and Revelation becomes the focus of everything that you think about. Again, we need to address all of God's topics, but even in our emphasis, we need to try to emphasize what God has emphasized. So let us not pick something that is along the side here and make that our main point. Let us not ride a hobby horse, a hobby force, okay. Not only do we need to preach the whole council, but we also need to practice the whole council. Sometimes, this is more difficult, isn't it? It's much more difficult. Many people can preach the whole counsel but when it comes to putting that into practice in their lives, it does become more difficult. Notice a few examples in Scripture. First of all, Matthew chapter 23 And verse 23. Jesus rebukes the Pharisees because they were doing some of God's word but not all of it.

Jeremy Sweets  17:50
He says to Woe to you scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites. For you tithe mint and dill and cumin and have neglected the weightier matters of law, justice and mercy and faithfulness. These you ought to have done without neglecting the others. You blind God straining out a gnat and swallowing a camel. You see what Jesus is telling the Pharisees here? He says, You have focused on the small things, the minute things and where are they wrong in doing that? Now, he says you ought to done you ought to have done those things. But the problem is they had left out big issues. And so they were doing the small things, but they had neglected justice, mercy, and faithfulness. We need to be a people that is seeking to practice all of God's were, and not neglecting any part of it. In James chapter one, verses 26 and 27. There's a discussion of a worthless religion. It says, If anyone thinks he is religious, and does not bridle his tongue, but deceives his heart, this person's religion is worthless, religion that is pure and undefiled. Before God the Father is this to visit orphans and widows in their affliction, and to keep oneself unstained. From the world. Ear, James is telling people that they need to be doers of the word, they need to practice their faith. It's not enough simply to say these things. And as they practice their faith, that means reaching out to those that are less fortunate, is going to immediately go into chapter two of our treatment of others. And chapter duties is going to say we're not to take a wealthy person and put them on the front seat of prominence in the congregation. And if a poor person comes in, we either bar the door or say, No, you sit in the back. That's how the world ranks and treats people but that's not how Christians treat people. We treat others as those that are made in the image of God, that have a soul and before God and that God gave His life in Jesus Christ for Each and every person. And so we see, practicing the whole council involves caring for others and loving others. We see this also in First Corinthians chapter 13. First Corinthians chapter 13. And the first three verses there it says, If I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, but do not have love on my noisy gong or a clanging cymbal, and if I have prophetic powers and understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but have not love, I am nothing. If I give away all that I have, and if I deliver my body to be burned, but have not love, I gain nothing. Paul says that if you're trying to practice a partial gospel, then often that is simply worthless. And we'll often do this to console ourselves, won't we? Because we can step back and say we're doing many religious things. But yet if we're leaving out big, important things, and that's a problem. So we can't simply console ourselves saying, I'm a religious person, I go to church three times a week, I'm a religious person, I read my Bible. That's, that's not enough. That's not what's involved in practicing the whole counsel of God. And so let us be a people that, that looks at all of God's Word and seeks to put that into practice in our lives.

Jeremy Sweets  21:29
We're going to do that today that will involve and include at least reading and studying the whole counsel of God, all of Scripture, we emphasize reading God's Word on a daily basis. And I think that's beneficial, you need to make it your goal to read throughout Scripture. Now, there's many different schedules and plans in which you can do that you can choose a year or longer or shorter than that. But we need to be a people that is reading God's word, studying God's Word. And we may all have favorite passages, but we can't neglect portions of God's Word. And we can't neglect subjects of God's were. And so we need to be reading and studying the whole council. We also need to serve God from the inside out from the inside out. God first of all demands our heart. And if we're to serve God, it must begin and start with our hearts as we bring our hearts before him. And so many people want to reserve that part for themselves and simply give God the outside, I'll give you the externals, I'll go through the motions, but I'll keep my heart to myself, because I want my heart for this hobby, or for this relative or for this other person, this job, this amount of money, we want to keep our heart to ourselves. But God demands just the opposite. He says we need to worship Him from the inside out. And so what comes out what is reflected in our outward motions and actions needs to come from a pure heart. It needs to shape and mold our hearts as we serve Him. So we need to serve God from the inside out. We also need to make no excuse for sin, we can often practice a partial gospel or part of God's word when we develop a sin or we have a sin and we begin to make excuses for it. Well, this is not that big a deal. Or, you know, at least I'm doing these other things, I give money to church, you know, so I should be able to do this. My good outweighs My bad. And so my pet sin here, I can keep them here at the house and feeding and, and do all that with. And when we begin to make excuses for sin, we are violating God's word. And we're really acting as a hypocrite in that regard. If we would keep back and hold on to his sin and say, I'm gonna keep this no matter what. When we begin to make excuses for sin, and we will only partially practices word. We also need to regularly examine our hearts. When we become a Christian, we must examine our lives. When we see sin in our lives and what we've done the God we need to repent of that and turn to him. But that's not something that happens only on day one as a Christian, but that's something that needs to regularly happen. And so we need to continually examine, we need to stop you know, we get comfortable in our lives as a Christian, we get in our routine and we're doing this but we need to stop and say, Wait a minute, am I doing what God says here? We need to listen to sermons as they challenge us and say, Wait a minute, am I practicing well If God wants, we need to go back to the scriptures, we need to restudy we need to look at things again and say, Is this what God says? Is this what God wants to me? And so a regular exam will do us good. We do that physically, don't we? We're supposed to get annual exams, we're supposed to have our hearts checked on a regular basis and, and look at those things. Well, spiritually, we

Jeremy Sweets  25:24
need to do the same thing. Regularly examine our hearts before God, practicing the whole council. What about perfectly keeping the whole council perfectly keeping the whole council? Can we keep the whole law at my last point was just talking about keeping the whole law. So is that something that we can do perfectly? Well, we make this important point. We do seek to keep all of God's word. But it's important to note that we obey God and try to do all of His Word out of a grateful heart, or in response to what he has done for us. We don't keep all of God's Word in order to be say. And we don't do that because we cannot do that. All have sin before God. And first drawn one in verse eight. It says, If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us. In Romans three in verse 23, it says, For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God. We also see in James chapter two and verse 10, for whoever keeps the whole wall but fails in warn points, has become guilty of all of it. And again, in James three and verse two, he says, For we all stumble in many ways. The Scriptures teach that we have sinned before God. And there's a couple of wrong directions we can go with that. We can say, well, we're all sinners anyway. So there's no point in trying. There's many people that have that attitude. The truth is, we can't save ourselves. We can't live a perfect life and put God in debt to us. But when we see what God has done for us, we can't help but respond and gratitude and thanksgiving, seeking to honor Him and His Word through what he has told us. And so the immeasurable gift of salvation is an immeasurable debt that we could never pay back. But we seek to and we strive to honor the one that has saved us God, and so we seek to obey Him. So it's important that we understand the motivation in keeping all of God's word. It's not in order to be saying, it will not save us. God saves us by His grace and mercy. But it is necessary in response to God's salvation, as a statement of gratitude to what God has done for us. We cannot perfectly keep the law, but Jesus did. But Jesus did. In first Peter to in verse 22, says he committed no sin, neither was deceit found in his mouth. Jesus lived the perfect life and he came here and lived a sinless life, there was no sin found anywhere in Jesus Christ. And because of that he can do for us what we cannot do for ourselves. We cannot save ourselves. We cannot provide a sacrifice that would atone for the guilt of sin. But Jesus Christ could do that for us. In Second Corinthians five in verse 21, says, for our sake, he made him to be sin, who knew no sin, so that in him we might become the righteousness of God.

Jeremy Sweets  29:01
Jesus Christ, our sinless savior, gave himself for us. In first Peter two verses 24 and 25. It says, He Himself bore sin in his body on the tree, that we might die to sin and live to righteousness, by His wounds, you have been healed. Jesus gave his life so that so that we might die to sin and live to righteousness, so that we might practice God's were so that we might live holy lives, so that we might seek Him with our entire being. It may be that as you do that, that you stumble even as a Christian, then we can pray to God and ask for his forgiveness and he'll forgive us. The difference is there's that we don't allow sin to simply live in our lives and say, that's no big deal. You know, a lot of people sin and I'm going to keep it there. No, we know that's wrong. When we put it aside, and if we stumble, we have a choice to make, am I going to just simply allow this sin to exist in my life? Or am I going to keep trying? Am I going to rely upon God and His power, His mercy and His grace? Am I going to ask him for forgiveness and seek to do better? That's our choice. We can either let sin reign, have the rain in our life, or we can push it away, seek to live holy, godly lives growing in His grace and His mercy. The whole counsel of God, we need to preach it. We need to practice it. And we need to understand that we've not done it perfectly. But we rely upon a Savior who has we rely upon a Savior who has Is there someone here tonight that's not a Christian? You have an opportunity to obey the gospel message, believing that Jesus is the Christ, repenting of your sins, confessing that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and being baptized in the water for the forgiveness of your sins. We see the Scripture tells us that when we do that, that we are raised from the waters of baptism to walk a new life. We are new people in Christ, and we have a new direction in life and a new commitment. If you're here tonight, and you're a Christian and not living as you should. Maybe you need to renew your commitment. Ask for forgiveness or ask for the prayers of the saints that we might pray for your strength. Our goal is heaven, and we want to get there together. There's any subject to the invitation. Please come as we stand and sing at this time.
