If you have your Bibles, I want to be turning to Romans, the sixth chapter.

Conrad Harkrider  00:14
What a blessing it is to be together on the first day of the week. And it was on the first day of the week at the break of dawn, when a group of women went to the tomb of Jesus. They knew the place because after watching him be crucified, they had followed and seeing the place where he was buried. At dawn on that Sunday morning, they took with them spices, intending to anoint his body as a sign of respect and love. But what was supposed to be a simple act of care, turned out to be the greatest and most important event that has ever occurred on this earth. They became the first witnesses of the resurrection of Jesus Christ. The resurrection is so important. Without the resurrection, our faith, and our religion are void. They're empty. Without the resurrection, this world is a place that is just filled with darkness, and despair and sadness. But because he lives, we have confidence. We have boldness, because Jesus was raised from the dead, we have hope. Our theme for 2019 is raised with Christ.

Conrad Harkrider  02:00
Because Jesus was raised, we also can be raised with Him. This is something that we reflect on and think about not just once a year, but every Sunday when we take the Lord's supper together, as our brother stated earlier that we think about his death, we think about what he went through, and how through God's power, he overcame the grave and was raised again. I wonder if the world truly appreciates what the resurrection means to us. And I wonder if we ourselves, appreciate and reflect on and think about what the resurrection means to our lives. This morning, we're going to look at a passage from Romans chapter six as we think about being raised with Christ, and living a new life in Christ. Read with me in Romans chapter six, beginning in verse one. It says, What shall we save, then? Are we to continue in sin that grace may abound? By no means? How can we who died to sin still live in it? Do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death, we were buried therefore with him in to death, that in order that just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, we too might walk in newness of life. For if we have been united with Him in a death like his, we shall certainly be united with Him in a resurrection like his. We know that our old self was crucified with Him, in order that the body of sin might be brought to nothing, so that we would no longer be enslaved to sin. For one who has died, has been set free from sin. Now, if we have died with Christ, we believe we will also live with him. We know that Christ's being raised from the dead will never die again. death no longer has dominion over him. For the death, he died, he died to sin once for all, but the life he lives he lives to God. So you also must consider yourselves dead to sin and alive to God in Christ Jesus. At the end of chapter five, Paul concludes of Romans, Paul is concluding his argument. And he's speaking of God's grace. He says that grace abounded all the more and that grace reigns through righteousness. Grace leads us to eternal life in Christ Jesus, this abundant grace is a blessing. It's a gift that we have received from God. And here in chapter six, he wants his readers to understand that What this grace means what it involves. And so he poses a question in verse one, a question that one might raise, after learning about this incredible gift of grace. This is something that a person might bring up. He says in verse one, what shall we say then? Are we to continue in sin that grace may abound? When we sin, God extends grace to us.

Conrad Harkrider  05:30
And so in order for God's grace to continue to flow and freely abound, does that mean that we must continue to sin? This will be like saying, when a when a community is devastated by a storm by a hurricane or tornado, that there is an outpouring of support, people give money, and they do what they can to help. And so generosity is a good thing. And therefore, we need more storms to happen. We need more communities to be devastated. You see how that's backwards thinking? It doesn't make any sense. And so this is the question that Paul asks, Are we to continue in sin? Should we keep going down this path? Should we stay on this course? And the answer that he gives is emphatic. He says, by no means absolutely not. Because we have been raised with Christ, that means that we are living a new life. And first of all, we can see here that a new life in Christ means that there is a change in direction. coming to Christ means that there is a re direction, we can't continue to go down the same road, the same course or path, we make a spiritual U turn, instead of following our own desires, we begin to follow Christ. In Acts chapter eight, we're told about a man named Simon who was a sorcerer. And the Bible tells us that when he heard the word of God, and saw the miracles that were being performed, he believed he believed in the Word of God, and he was baptized. But after seeing the power of the Holy Spirit, and realizing that this power was greater than anything that he had ever experienced or done, he asked to purchase the power to be able to pass it on to others. This was a selfish desire was for his own gain his own benefit. Even though he had believed even though he had been baptized, he was still thinking about his personal ambitions. And Peter said to him in Acts chapter eight and verse 22, Repent therefore of this your wickedness, and pray God if perhaps the thought of your heart may be forgiven you, Peter tells him that he needs to repent, that's to turn away. He tells him that the thought of his heart needs to change. He has to change, direction. Changing direction starts with changing our hearts, changing our minds the way we think it's not possible for us to change actions and behavior without first changing our minds. My grandfather told us a story about when he was a little boy growing up his father used to smoke this was back in the late 1930s, and 40s. And he said that one day, as a three or four year old, he went up to a bush, and he grabbed a twig off of the bush, and he put it up to his mouth, and acted as if he was smoking. And his father saw him and he said, What are you doing? He said, I'm pretending to be like, Daddy. He said his father made the decision at that point, to give it up to stop smoking. After seeing the impact that his actions were having on the people around him on his children, he made up his mind that he was going to quit.

Conrad Harkrider  09:20
And isn't that true? If we are going to make lasting changes in our life if we are going to go a different direction, whether that's in regards to a habit or to the way that we eat or our diets, or in our spiritual lives in serving God and Christ, we have to change the way that we think change our minds and our hearts. If our mind and our heart is not set on going a different path and how can we possibly make correction in our life? This is what Paul says in Romans chapter 12. And verse two, he says, Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Mind, when we come to Christ, we have to think differently to see the world differently. And that means that things that once entertained us that we thought were enjoyable, that were pleasant. Now those things are disgraceful things that once appealed to us. They enticed us now they are. They're repulsive people that we used to admire that we looked up to that we respected, that we wanted them to respect us. Now, we're not concerned with what they think all of this happens because of a changed mind. A change mind is really about a change in the priorities that we have. Before coming to Christ, our priorities were on the physical. We cared about the car that we drove the house that we lived in the stuff that we had, that was our main focus our priority. Our priority was focused on the flesh. We were emphatic about our lusts, our desires, fulfilling our needs. And once before coming to Christ, our priority was on the world, on gaining prominence on elevating ourselves on lifting ourselves up what other people thought of us. But in Christ, we give our hearts to the Lord. And as Paul says, Here, how can we go on continuing to pursue these things, there must be a change. We have been crucified with Christ is no longer I who live but Christ who lives in me Galatians two and verse 20. Not only is there a change in direction, but look at what he says in verse six, Romans six and verse six. He says, We know that our old self was crucified with Him, in order that the body of sin might be brought to nothing so that we would no longer be enslaved to sin. Living this new life in Christ means that we crucify the old self, there is a death that has occurred. Notice verse two, in verse two, he refers to those who have died to sin. In verse 11, he says, so you also must consider yourselves dead to sin and alive to God. living a new life in Christ means that we have crucified put to death, the old self crucifixion. That was one of the most horrific and brutal ways for a person to die. In the ancient world, people were completely stripped of their clothes, their hands and their feet were nailed to a piece of wood. They were raised up, put in a public place, a common area where people would pass by for all to see, the process was designed to delay the person's death. And to prolong their suffering. There was nothing humane or decent about it, it was a vicious and barbaric way to end one's life. Have you ever considered why God allowed or why God chose crucifixion, for the means by which his son would be put to death? Yes, we understand that Jesus had to die he had to give a sacrifice in order for us to be freed from our sin. But why could why Could the Lord not have chosen a different method? Why did his son have to go through the most degrading and painful means of death? Why did it have to happen? In Romans chapter five and verse eight. It says that God demonstrates His own love towards us, He shows His love for us, and that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.

Conrad Harkrider  14:16
Christ's death on the cross through crucifixion shows God's love, the greater the suffering, the greater our appreciation for what he went through on our behalf. But I also think the cross gives us a visible display of the terrible and devastating effects of sin. Sin is, is ugly, just as they tore through the flesh of Jesus. Sin tears through relationships, through families through marriages, just as they pierced and hung in there to die sin pierces our soul and kills us spiritually. Jesus didn't just die this quiet, peaceful death. In his sleep, he was crucified. And that was the price that he was required to pay, so that we can be forgiven. Galatians three and verse 13 says, that He redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us. This is what Christ had to endure. But notice that it's interesting that then Paul turns and says that we too, must be crucified with Him. We have to go through this same process in a spiritual sense, when being raised with Christ living this new life. And so the question is, have we nailed our sin to the cross? Have we publicly and openly exposed our sin? Have we dragged it out of the city and pierced it through until it is dead from our lives? Have we taken that decisive action? In front of all to say, I'm no longer going to live for sin? In Numbers chapter 25, the children of Israel had been ensnared in sexual immorality. They had been enticed by the Moabites and engaged in sexual sin. And as Moses in the congregation are trying to figure out what they're going to do about this, this problem, there is a man who brings one of the Moabite women into the congregation, almost as if he's just doing it blatantly right in front of everyone. Do you remember what happened next? One of the men, a man by the name of Phineas grabbed a spear. And he went to the man and the woman and he thrust the spear through both of them. And after seeing this, God said to Moses, Phineas, the son of LEA is the son of air and the priest has turned my anger away from the Israelites, since he was zealous for my honor, among them. crucifying the old self means being willing to take drastic measures. We identify what it is that's causing us to stumble and we remove it from our path. We take the spear, we take the spike, and we drive it through our lust. We put to death, our our jealousy, our greed, or whatever it is, that is causing us to stumble and remove it from our path. It doesn't mean that we're perfect people. Doesn't mean that we don't face temptation that we don't struggle, that we don't have times of weakness and difficulty. But it does mean that we absolutely refuse to settle for that old way of living. We don't go back we see sin for what it is. We call it what it is, instead of accepting or justifying or just learning to live with it. It grieves us it brings us to anger it causes us to take action. In Christ, we are no longer slaves to sin to obey its lusts and its passions. Instead, we have been renewed and transformed. To be raised with Christ means a new life. And in that new life, we crucify and put to death, the old self. Also notice from this text to live a new life means that we must be buried with him in baptism. We must be buried with Christ in baptism. Notice what verse three says,

Conrad Harkrider  19:11
Do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death? Baptism is something that unites us with Christ. It is amazing. When you listen to the language here that Paul is using, that we could do anything that would join us together with Christ. Jesus is the King. He is the ruler over all of God's creation. He has been given all power, authority and dominion over the earth. Most of us in general don't have much to do with those who are powerful in this world. We don't walk with them. We don't sit down and eat with them. We don't talk to them. They are kept at a distance there. is a separation between us and them. But when you and I are baptized in to Christ, we are brought into this special fellowship, a connection with the Son of God. We are buried with Him. Verse five says we are united with Him in a death like his. We are with Christ in baptism, just a few observations about baptism. Notice verse three. Who does this? Include here? He says, Do you not know that all of us who have been baptized? This is not something that was just observed by a select group or a few people, but Paul uses global universal terms. Every Christian all of us have been baptized into his death. And that's because baptism is what brings us into contact with the blood with the death of Jesus Christ without his death, there is no forgiveness. There is no renewal, there is no hope. How was the gospel? How was the gospel announced to Israel? Who was it that prepared the way of the Lord? It was John the Baptist and what was he doing out there in the wilderness? He was baptizing the people as they came out to him. What did Jesus do before he began his ministry? He was baptized in the Jordan River. What message did Peter deliver to the people on the day of Pentecost when he preached that first sermon, after Jesus had been raised from the dead, he said, Repent and be baptized. Baptism was not an afterthought or a compliment to the new believers faith. It was immediately done when a person was convicted of the gospel message. In Acts chapter eight, as Philip and the unit were travelling along that desert road, the text tells us that the unit commanded that the chariot be stopped, they got out of the chariot went down on the side of the road, and he was baptized into Christ. Baptism brings us into contact with his blood so that our sins can be washed away. Acts 22 And verse 16. Notice what verse seven says, verse seven says, For one who has died has been set free from sin, we cannot be released from our sins, set free from our sins until we have died with Christ. How do we die with Christ? We have to crucify our old selves put to death, the old man and then to be buried with him in baptism. Baptism is a burial. When you bury a body, you don't sprinkle dirt on top of it, you put it under the ground, baptism is an immersion a bearing in water. Baptism is also for those who have been convicted of sin. Verse six says that in order that the body of sin might be brought to nothing. Baptism is not just a step. It's not just one of the things that we do in coming to Christ. It is a total and complete giving of oneself to the Lord. We renounce the old way of living, and give ourselves entirely to the Lord. My grandparents were married for over 50 years. And on the day that they got married, they said their vows and of course they loved each other.

Conrad Harkrider  23:54
But that love was not something that was static. It just stayed in the same place. After having children, watching their grandchildren grow, experiencing life's greatest joy is going through this world's deepest sorrows. Their love, continued to increase and mature and grow. When we get baptized, our commitment to Christ our faith in God is strong, but it doesn't stop there. Our love and desire to serve him should only grow stronger. Do we love God? Do we feel more committed to Him today than the first day that we believed than the day that we were baptized into Christ? For the remission of our sins? Is our faith and devotion to Him? Is it increasing? Is it abounding more and more? We must be buried with him in baptism that is the start of a lifelong relationship of respect and admiration and service to the He finally being raised with Christ, and walking a new life means the following Look at Verse 11. He says, so you also must consider yourselves dead to sin and alive to God in Christ. We are alive to God. In Christ, we have life. The old way of living is a path that leads to death. It is bondage, it is slavery, but we've replaced that, with new life, we are alive to God. The old way of living was a way of futility. But now in Christ, we've traded that for purpose. The old way of living was selfishness. But in Christ, we now show a life of service, the old way of living meant looking at the world and the things that would happen and the tragedy in the world, we would see that in despair. But in Christ, our life is filled with hope. In Acts, chapter three, when Peter and John went into the temple, there was there was a lay man who was there sitting by the gate. And instead of giving him some food, or some money, they reached down, Peter grabbed his hand and lifted him up and immediately, his feet and ankles were strengthened. Do you remember what his reaction to that event was? In Acts chapter three and verse eight. It says that leaping up, he stood and began to walk and enter the temple with them, walking and leaping and praising God, he can hardly contain his excitement. And we can understand why the text tells us that this man was over 40 years old, that he had never walked in his life. And so of course, he was overcome with joy. But as, as amazing as this was, in Christ, we have an even greater blessing. We have something that is even more precious, even more valuable than regaining the ability to walk, we've been justified, we've been washed, we've been cleansed from our sins, we went from a state of being dead to now being alive. And so what is our response to God? Do we find ourselves being filled with joy? Do we openly and unashamedly praise him? Can others see that thankfulness that gratitude in our hearts is that being expressed openly to the Lord? Being alive to God means that the Spirit of Jesus Christ dwells in us. Romans chapter eight, verses nine and 10, the Spirit of Christ is in us. And in order for that to be real, we have to be feeding on his word, listening to his word, taking it in eating from spiritual food on a regular, consistent basis, because that's ultimately what's going to sustain our souls. There's a song that was written by Jonathan and Melissa Helzer. The title is no longer slaves. And the chorus of the song says, I'm no longer a slave, to fear. I am a child of God. No longer a slave to fear. I'm a child of God. Think about what you were enslaved to before you came to Christ. What was it that entrapped you? What was it that held you captive? Because we have been raised with Christ, we

Conrad Harkrider  28:51
have this new life, we can say with confidence. I am no longer a slave, to addiction, to pornography to lust, I'm no longer a slave, to jealousy, to greed, to worldliness. I'm no longer a slave to anxiety to worry to depression, and cry Christ we are children of God. In Romans chapter eight, in verse 16, it says, We are children of God and if children, then heirs, heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ, provided we suffer with Him in order that we may be also be glorified with Him. Because we're in Christ, we have this new life and that means that we are more than just members of a church. We are children of God, heirs of God, and the inheritance and the promise that God is offering to each person is far greater than anything that we could ever have in this life. God is extending his invitation to all of us Have we changed our direction? Have we been raised with Christ? Have we been buried with him and baptism? Have we crucified that old man? And now are we walking a new life? are we alive to God? We're gonna close with a song this morning if there's something that we can do to encourage you, to pray for you, to help you in your walk with the Lord. If you need to confess your faith in Christ, to put on Jesus and baptism to have your sins washed away, whatever it may be, please come down to the front as we stand and sing this song.
