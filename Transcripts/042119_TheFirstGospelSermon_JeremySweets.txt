Good evening. It's good to see everyone here tonight. It's been a good day, a beautiful day, it's the Lord's day. So it's been good and, and that we can gather together and worship our God. appreciate the fact that each and every one of you are here tonight and that we have an opportunity once again to open up God's word and study it. I will say I felt like preachers say this all the time, but it's true. Allergies have attacked my voice, so I'm gonna do my best to make it through this. I was at rock church this morning. And Caleb said that Caleb gray their preacher, and I thought his voice sounds fine did just fine. I seem to have a strong voice, but I'm dealing with allergies a little bit. And so we'll see how this goes. I'd like to look this morning or this evening at the first gospel sermon, the first gospel sermon. So open your Bibles to Acts chapter two. I'll try to quickly summarize Acts chapter one and the first part of chapter two. Before we get into that, the main part of the text of the sermon there. I will mention that I do not have PowerPoint, I know that some of you are visually oriented. And so I did think even though I didn't, I was away from my computer and didn't get it done before I when I can tell you exactly what I would put through the PowerPoint. I'm going to point that along here at the top, the first gospel sermon x two. And the good thing about this is you get to choose your own font, whatever you want. In Acts chapter one, we see that the resurrected Christ is gathered together with his disciples. And they asked him the question in chapter one and verse six, Lord, will You at this time restore the kingdom to Israel, He said to them, it is not for you to know times or seasons that the Father is fixed by his own authority, but you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you. And you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem and Judea, and Samaria and to the end of the earth. It's been pointed out by some and I think it's a good device here to remember that chapter one, verse eight serves as an outline for the rest of the book is it starts from Jerusalem, and it spreads out to Judea and Samaria, and then to the ends of the earth, the gospel is taken, we see that Jesus tells them that it is not the time for them to know. But as he finishes this, as they are looking at him, it says that he is taken up, and he has lifted up out of their sight. And they see two men that are there in white robes. And they speak to him about this Jesus that as he is taken up, so he will return. We also see that Matthias is chosen as a replacement of Judas. And as they are choosing this replacement. They want one that has been with Jesus in His teaching ministry as he went about teaching them, but also one that witness the resurrection or the resurrected Christ. In chapter two, verses one through four, there we see that it's on the day of Pentecost, which would have been 50 days after the Passover. And on the Day of Pentecost, when they were all gathered together, there were tongues as a fire that descended upon the disciples there, and the Holy Spirit filled them. And the text says that they began to speak, they began to speak in tongues as the Spirit gave them utterance. And verses five through 13. This created quite a commotion. People were confused, they were bewildered,

Jeremy Sweets  04:01
what is going on? Now at the time of Pentecost, I'll just remember that that many travelers had come to Jerusalem in there to observe that feast. And so it was not only the regular inhabitants, but also much of Israel had traveled to there at that time. And so the text says that they are bewildered. And part of the reason that they were confused is that they could each hear the message in their own language, even though the men that were speaking were from Galilee. And so they were amazed in verse 12 of chapter two it says, And they were amazed and perplexing to one another. What does this mean? But others were mocking and said, they are filled with nuwan? Some were confused and some said no, they're just drawn. Now Peter stands with the 11 and verse 14. And it says he lifted up his voice and a dress the men of God and those who dwell in Jerusalem And he says the men are not drunk. This is not something that is gibberish. But rather, this is something that is extremely important. This is not just an ordinary occurrence of being drunk. But this is an extra an ordinary occurrence of the Spirit descending upon the disciples here so that they could proclaim God's word. And it was, according to what God was doing that this was coming about. Peter says, This was according to the prophet Joel, and it shall be in the last days that God declares, and there again, we see the spirit, we're gonna see the Spirit quite often in our text as we go along. It started with Jesus saying, The Spirit would come upon you, the spirit was used to select the replacement. And here again, the spirit comes as tongues. And and now the prophecy that he uttered, that he tells him as I'm Joel, and he says in verse 17, and 18, that the Spirit will come. And the Spirit will come in such a way that it will come upon all flesh, it says, and you're not to discriminate there based on on gender or age or even social setting, on daughters and sons, young men and old men, on male and female servants, the Spirit would be poured out, not only that, but we see in 19 and 20, that, that the wonders would occur wonders in the heaven and on earth below. And so sides would accompany these, this pouring out of the spirits. And then finally, in verse 21, we see much of the, the goal here of what has to happen in these last days, and it shall come to pass, and everyone who calls upon the name of the Lord shall be say, and so as it mentions, before the day of the Lord, which is often associated with judgment would come there. But from that judgment, some could be rescued, those that would call upon the name of the Lord. So if I might summarize what Peter is saying, again, he is saying, This is not an ordinary occurrence. But this, these are extraordinary times. This is something that God has been looking for, for many, many years. And so the prophet Joel was pointing to that. So now he gets really into the heart of his gospel message.

Jeremy Sweets  07:29
So over here, gospel, we'd have that underlined. Now, what Peter is going to do is he's going to bring four points. And one of the first things we see about what Peter does when he preaches this gospel sermon is he talks about what God does through Jesus. And he's gonna make four points like that. So his sermon is God centered. And Jesus focused, as he talks about this gospel right here. Now the first point you see in verse 22, the first point in verse 22, men of Israel hear these words Jesus of Nazareth, a man attested you by God with mighty works and wonders and signs that God did through Him in your midst, as you yourselves know. So the first point that he makes about Jesus that God did through Jesus, the first point that we see is that he, Jesus wasn't a tested, Jesus was a tested. Now how was he attested, and what do we see in verse 22? Well, before I even get to that point, let me just tell you exactly which Jesus I'm talking about. Peter wanted the people there to know which Jesus was the Jesus that they knew. But it was the Jesus of Nazareth, a man attested to you. The people there had witnessed those signs. In fact, he says that in verse 22, he had performed these signs, just as you yourself know, just as the people of Jerusalem were aware. But to make the point for us, we were not there. We did not see those things. But the Jesus that he's talking about is a real person, a historical person, not Jesus from a land once upon a time, not Jesus from the lost city of Atlantis. This is not a made up story, but this is Jesus of Nazareth, a real place. And this was a man, a man that came among them. So the first thing that we see when Peter gets into this is that this was a man that was attested to you by God and how did that happen? Well through his life, and through the miracles that he performed. You might think of a testing as something along the lines of identification fire to go somewhere and I want to pick up a check or find a pickup some kind of legal document, they might ask for identification. How do we know that this is you? And so I get out my ID card it has my picture I had to show up to take it, it has my information on it, I show them that and I say, I see that this is you. Well, how did God do that through Jesus Christ, he did that, through mighty works and wonders and signs, mighty works for displays of the mighty works of God. They were not things that ordinary men could do. They were mighty works accomplished by God's mighty hand. And so Jesus was attested, because this had to come from God. He goes on to say, not only Mani works, but wonders. Those go hand in hand, don't they? If we witness a mighty work, then we stand in awe. We wonder, we are amazed. And that's what the miracles of Jesus did. They were mighty works of God that others saw and marveled at. And not only that, but they were signs, they pointed to something else. They were not just intended to evoke a reaction and say, Oh, that's neat, or that was cool. But rather, these were signs that pointed to spiritual truths and to the truths that God would bring about. And so they pointed to something else. Now, this is what God did through Him in your midst. And he again recalls that, that they would see these things and know about them. So that's the first thing, the life of Jesus, he was a testament. Okay, the second point that we see there is that God delivered him up, God delivered him up in verse 23, says, this Jesus, this historical figure, the one of Nazareth, the one that you've all seen and know about this, Jesus, delivered up according to the definite plan and foreknowledge of God. You know, there are some people that say that, that the death of Jesus was an accident, that that was not according to God's plan, that he had to shift his plans in order to accommodate the fact that Jesus would die. But that is not at all what this passage teaches. This Jesus delivered up according to the definite plan and foreknowledge of God, God desired that this would happen. And he says that you crucified and killed by the hands of lawless men, this Jesus, and so we see that he was delivered up, and that he was crucified. crucifixion was a means of execution by the Roman Empire and used at this time, it was a shameful execution reserved for for criminals, and foreigners. And this is what they did to Jesus, they executed him as a criminal. Now, you see, really some of the

Jeremy Sweets  13:01
the other word just left me, paradox. You see the paradox of the cross in verse 23. The cross is something that God determined, isn't it. But yet it was carried out by lawless men, those that were opposed to God's plan. And these lawless men crucified Him. God allowed this to happen. He allowed their wills here, as they chose to, to sin against God and sin against Christ. And they thought, as they carried out their will, that they were winning, so to speak. They were putting to death. This man, they were silencing this man, they were showing their power over him. But they were wrong, weren't they? This was according to God's plan. God would bring this about. And so we see the first part of this gospel sermon points to the attestation, or the identification as one from God in verse 22. And secondly, we see that this one was delivered up to be crucified. Okay, what's the third point of the gospel sermon here on the left, you see, the third point is the resurrection of Christ. Verse 24, through 30 through 32, through 31. And so we spent a little bit more time here it says, God raised Him up. God raised Him up. We saw that he was crucified that he was executed that he was killed. But that was not the end of the story. Verse 24, says God raised Him up, loosing the pangs of death, because it was not possible for him to be held by it. you almost think of a rope that's tied around somebody that's so tight that they cannot get free. That's normally the hold that death has on people. Once you die, that's all there is. Once you die, there is no coming back from that there is no returning to life as we know it. But for Jesus Christ, that was not the case, the pains of death, or the the securing, groping around, that death would normally hold, did not hold for Jesus Christ. He could not be held by notice in verses 25 through 28.

Jeremy Sweets  15:46
Here, Peter is going to quote to them a Psalm of David and make his point about Jesus Christ. This song comes from Psalm 16, which is insets, a lament or a cry out to God for help in times of trouble. The psalmist in Psalm 16 realizes that there are those that do not worship God, they worship after idols, and they seem to be seeking the heart of the psalmist. And he calls out for God's help in his deliverance in these times, and he also announces his confidence in God. But notice in verse 25, For David says, concerning him, I saw the Lord always before Me, for He is at my right hand, and I might not be shaken, Therefore my heart was glad and my tongue rejoice, my flesh also will dwell in hope, for you will not abandon my soul to Hades or let your Holy One see corruption. You have made known to me the paths of life, you will make me full of gladness with Your presence. Notice that the very beginning he says, I saw the Lord always before me, David is going to be speaking here in the first person, but he's going to be speaking as a representative of Christ. And so he says, I saw the Lord always before Me, for He is at my right hand, we normally think of Jesus being at the right hand position of honor of God. But here it says that God is at the right hand of this one. The speaking here, he is at the right hand, may be pointed out that often an advocate in a legal sense would stand at the right hand of someone, they would provide help. And here we see that this one that is the Lord is looking out to the to God is that his right hand? Verse 26, he says, Therefore, my heart was glad, my tongue rejoice, and my flesh also will dwell in hope. Notice how hope comes for this individual. It doesn't come piecemeal, but it comes in such a way that it covers his entire body, it covers his heart, it comes out of his tongue, and his entire body or flesh dwells in hope, because of his confidence in God. Notice in verse 27, and this is really one of the key points of this passage that he's trying to bring out. He says, For you will not abandon my soul to Hades or let your Holy One see corruption. David was calling upon God, that he would not deliver him to death to these other individuals. But here we see that as we apply this, as Peter applies this, we could not say that in an ultimate sense about David. David could not say that, that he was able to forego Hades or forego corruption.

Jeremy Sweets  18:43
And he says in verse 28, you have made known to me the paths of life, you'll make me full of gladness within your presence. The confidence that the psalmist has here is something that was not fully realized in David. Notice verse 29, as he goes on to explain this. Brothers on Matt may say to you with confidence about the patriarch David, that he both died and was buried and his tomb is with us to this day, being there for a profit and knowing that God has sworn with an oath to him that he would see one of his descendants on his throne. He foresaw and spoke about the resurrection of the Christ, that He was not abandoned to Hades, nor did His flesh see corruption. You see the point that he's making here. He says, we have the tomb of David to us to this day, and his body corrupted in that tomb. He does not have an empty tomb. In fact, they knew where the tomb was even at that time, and they could point to that, but of Jesus Christ, what about his tomb? He was also another figure that was commonly known in that area, worried about him had spread far and wide. And what about his tune? Well, it was empty wasn't his boss. Adi his flesh was not undergoing decay. His, his soul was not abandoned in Hades. In fact, he was able to leave this realm of the dead, He did not stay there. But he came back to life. And many there witnessed those things. And so we see through verse 31, Jesus was raised, we see the life of Jesus, he was attested by His miracles, we see that he was delivered up according to the plan of God, we see that he was resurrected. And now we're going to see as a fourth point under here, the gospel of fourth point that he was raised again, notice verse 32, really uses the exact same language from 24. This Jesus God raised up, now you raised him up out of death didn't. But he again, raised him in verse 32, he raised him up in the ascension. And He raised Him up to exultation. And that's exactly what we see happened in chapter one. This Jesus, God raised us, and of that we are all witnesses, being there for exalted at the right hand of God and having received from the Father the promise of the Holy Spirit, He has poured out this that you yourselves are seeing and hearing for David did not ascend into heaven, but he himself says, The Lord said to my Lord, set up my right hand until I make your enemies your footstool. And here God is speaking to the Lord, have David, set up my right hand, and you see this place of prominence here. It's interesting that that, in the resurrection, God was at the right hand of Jesus, he was his advocate the power there that came about, but here now God says that Jesus, you said at my right hand, and we see that he is in a place of prominence, a place of exultation at the right hand of God. You'll also notice that the resurrected Christ is a living Christ. I live in Christ, for he says in verse 33, that it is this one that has poured out this the Holy Spirit that you yourselves are seeing and hearing, Jesus is active, and living, he's not dead. He's not dead. He's living an act. This same point is going to be made in chapter three, or chapter three and verse 13. Chapter Three, we're gonna see a healing of a lame man. And some began to question why they would do that. And who are you preaching in? Noticing chapter three and verse 13, is, as Peter and John respond to this, says, The God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob, the God of our fathers glorified his servant Jesus, whom you delivered over, and denied in the presence of Pilate when he had decided to release Him, but you denied the Holy and Righteous One and asked for a murderer to be granted to you, and you kill the author of life, whom God raised from the dead. To this, we are witnesses, and his name, my faith in His name has made this man strong, whom you see, you know, and the faith that is through Jesus has given this man this perfect health, in the presence of you all, the power of Jesus is seen of a living an act of being as he brings healing for this man. Peter says,

Jeremy Sweets  23:42
Jesus did that. He's not dead, and in the ground, and ceasing to exert any power at all. No, he is active, he is active. And so we see the four points that Peter makes in his gospel, God centered, Jesus focused, he talks about all the things that God did through Jesus. And he talks about what that means. Well, we're looking at verse 36. But I wanted to make a point to the fact that the gospel sermon was also the study that induced a response and brought about a response. And so we have our gospel here with our four points about what God did in Jesus Christ, I would have an arrow here from gospel to response. So I want to spend the rest of my time talking about that response, the response that is demanded by the gospel. Notice verse 36. He begins the meat of his conversation in verse 22. And he ends in much the same way. But all the house of Israel therefore know for certain that God has made Him both Florida and Christ, this Jesus whom you crucify, you'll see that God has made a decision. God has made a choice and that choice is of Jesus Christ. And that same one that God shows they rejected. Now, there were many people that were coming to Jerusalem at this time. But he very likely was talking to some of the very same people that had been shouting, Crucify, crucify. And when he says, You killed him, sometimes we abstract that for us knowing that our sins that put him there, and that's a very real thing. But he is saying, you literally killed him, sent him to his death. And it's hard to imagine the weight of those words, isn't it? But he says, God's choice, God's choice that has been for ordained that has been spoken of in prophecy for hundreds of years, God's choice is the one you rejected. You see that in verse 22, and 23, this one that God delivered up to a predetermined plan, he was put to death by lawless men. Now he makes that point, again, God's choice is the one that you reject. And in fact, in chapter three, in the part that I read there, he says, The that that Jesus is God's choice, the glorified servants. And again, he says, that's the one that you crucify. So when we talk about the gospel, what it does is it challenges us to change away from our sinful ways. Science tells us that an object in motion tends to stay in motion. Our experience in the Bible tells us that sinful hearts in motion of sin, they tend to stay that way, people tend to follow after their own selfish will, they don't tend to change something has to step in the way so to speak, something has to create that change. And that's what the gospel can do. It demands a response. And so as he tells these people that God's choice was rejected by you notice what it says in verse 37. says, Now, when they heard this, they were cut to the hearts, they were cut to the heart. Now we're going to see that 3000 souls are going to be saved here. But let me just step aside, I was looking for an estimate of the number of people that would have been in Jerusalem at this time, and I'm not sure about how many that was, I'm not sure exactly how many were listening here. But my guess it was many, many more than 3000. And so the first thing that we see that some of the people did, and we do that simply from the numbers, there were some that continued on, then they're mocking, as it says in verse 13. And they simply rejected the Gospel message. There were some that were not cut to the heart, there were some that did not listen to this message. And so we see that rejection of the gospel is certainly a possibility. There are people that continue to stay in the same thing they've been doing, and they do not change. And so that's one option. The second option is to accept the gospel message and be converted by it to be chain. And the first thing we see in the process of conversion is a change of hearts, a change of hearts. In chapter two and verse 37, it says, Now, when they heard this, they were cut to the heart.

Jeremy Sweets  28:43
Remember what people tend to do, they tend to do the same thing, the same comfortable thing, they tend not to change, they tend to want to avoid change, but hear this message demanded it. And they were cut to the heart. They believe the gospel message, they believe the fact that God's choice was the one that they had rejected. And so they say, What shall we do? Something needs to happen about this, something needs to be done. We cannot continue in this same state. They were cut to the heart. And they wanted to know what to do about that. Well, Peter says in verse 38, Repent and be baptized. So what we see is a change of heart when it comes to conversion, as followed by a change of action. You have to change not only how you feel about that, not only the direction and commitment of your heart, but then you have to follow through with what you do. And so Peter tells the people here that they need to repent of that. They need to change their hearts they need to change their actions. They need to stop rejecting The one that God has chosen. And so he says, Repent and be baptized. Repentance is an about face, isn't it? It is that change. It's a change in direction, a change in commitment, a change in heart. And Peter says you must repent and be baptized. Not only does he say to repent, but part of that process also is to be baptized, to be baptized. When you were baptized, Romans six reminds us that we are buried with Christ, and we are raised to walk in newness of life. God accomplished the resurrection through Jesus Christ. But what he provides to us is an opportunity to be saved as well, that resurrection is a help to us, Repent and be baptized every one of you. So we see the first two things in conversion, a change of hearts, and a change of action. But notice what that creates number three, here, y'all got your font picked out. Okay, what that creates is a change in relationship between God and man. When people are genuinely converted, they are those that are changed by the gospel message. They have a change of heart, a change of action, but they can also have a change of relationship with God. Peter says, When you repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ, you do that for the forgiveness of your sins. Sin is what keeps us away from God. Sin is what causes God to hide his face from us. It's not God's fault, that we have a separation in that relationship, it's our fault. It's our sin. But when we are converted to Christ, through the gospel message of what God has done for us when we are converted, when we repent, and change from that, we can have our sins washed away, we can have our sins forgiven. And we can have a changed relationship with God a closer relationship, one of communion and fellowship, we can be His child. And what a great blessing. That is. He goes on, if you've been following the train of thought of the Holy Spirit, continuing on, he says, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit's for the promises for you and for your children and for all who are far off everyone whom the Lord our God calls to himself. And it's not my intention now to go through and explain the different options there for what the Holy Spirit could mean. But it's clearly part of the text. And the theme that follows all the way through, I would suggest that this is a special occasion. It's a time when the ages have converged, so to speak, the prophecies of old have looked forward to this time. And we see that they would again be the sense of being a tested further, but tested further as many signs would come from that. But another thing we could see is that this gospel message, this promise of the Spirit was not just for one nation. It was not just for one nation, but it was for all people, for all people. Well, I

Jeremy Sweets  33:27
see two main elements. In this sermon, I see the gospel is preached what God has done through Jesus Christ, and I see that that demands a response of receiving the word, listening to the Word, bringing it into our hearts, so that the gospel would change us repenting and being baptized, we see that this was not the end for these disciples, but only the beginning. For we see in Acts chapter two in verse 42, they devoted themselves continually to the apostles doctrine, to fellowship, to the breaking of bread and prayer. And the rest of Acts tells us about disciples that would continue to devote their life to Him. There are a lot of good things in the first gospel sermon, a lot of good things that we still need to listen to. And he heed that message. It still has power today. So I appreciate the fact that you've opened up your Bibles with me and studied the first gospel sermon. Maybe there's someone here tonight, that's not a Christian. That's not living after God. You're living after your own way and your own sin. And if that's the case, you need to change. You need to be cut to the heart about what God has done for you. You need to repent and be baptized, just as Peter told the people at that day, and that will begin your walk as a Christian. What you're doing there is committing your life to him the rest of your life, to follow him all of your days. If you're here tonight and you are a Christian, and you're not following that commitment, then you need to change as well. recommit yourself make sure that you're living in the right way before God judgment will come and we all need to be ready there's any subject to the invitation please come as we stand insane at this time
