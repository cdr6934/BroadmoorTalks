Do you have your Bibles and want to be turning to second Corinthians chapter four?

Over the past 50 years, there have been some amazing advancements in the field of medicine. One of those improvements is in regards to organ transplants think about it, doctors can take an organ of the body of from one body and implanted or transplanted to another person. And it still works, that's the most important part. And I'm told that this process is it's very time sensitive, there's only a matter of hours that they have to complete the transfer. For example, with a heart, it's around for hours. And so because of this, there are special companies that have popped up that all they do is they they transport things like this from one place to another. And in order to do that they use cars or helicopters, or even jet airplanes to make sure that it gets there. With enough time. I want you to imagine if one of those transports was happening, and it just occurred that the vehicle got a flat tire. And you were the only car other car that was close by you were the only other person that was around. And so they asked you if you could be the one to take this organ on its final leg over to the hospital. So they get the little cooler out of the back and they hand it to you. How are you feeling about that? You you throw in that in the back with all the rest of your stuff in the trunk? You are you tossing it in the back seat? Are you putting it next to the two year old that's kicking and flailing their legs? No, I imagine that we are showing great care. We are paying attention we put that in is in a safe place. And then we are driving with two hands on the wheels. When we get to the hospital. We're carefully walking in white knuckled grip on the box. Why is so much care and attention given because this is something that is valuable. This is a person's life. This is someone is waiting on this, that it could completely change their situation to be entrusted with something that is so precious. That would be a tremendous responsibility, would it not?

Our theme for 2018 is faithful stewards. And this morning I want to talk about something that we have been given that's been placed in our care. As we think about being entrusted with the gospel, being given the gospel. Read with me in second Corinthians chapter four, beginning in verse five. Second Corinthians four in verse five. It says, For we do not preach ourselves but Christ Jesus, the Lord and ourselves, your bond servants for Jesus sake. For it is the God who commanded light to shine out of darkness who has shown in our hearts to give the light of the knowledge of the glory of God in the face of Jesus Christ. But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellence of the power may be of God and not of us. First of all, notice as we think about being entrusted with the gospel that we have received a treasure. We have received a treasure. Paul and Timothy are writing to the Corinthians. And he says in verse five that we are not trying to preach ourselves. We're not proclaiming ourselves. This isn't about us. It's not about the preacher. It's not about the teacher. It's not about the inviter. It's all about Jesus. In verse six. He goes, he goes on to say that it was God, the same God who created light, the One who created the world and everything in it. He gave us physical light, a light that we can see with our eyes, but he also gives us spiritual light, the light that shines into our hearts And he makes that parallel. And what is this light that is shining into our hearts. It's the knowledge. It's knowing the glory of God in the face of Christ Jesus. And if you have that knowledge, if you have that understanding, then then you have light, you have truth you have clarity and direction in, in a world filled with darkness. Notice verse seven, what he says about this, he says, we have this treasure. He calls it. This knowledge, this light, he says it's a treasure a treasure is something of great worth, or value. It's something that is rare and precious. He says that's what we possess. And they make a comparison. He says, compared to what we hold this knowledge when you compare that to us, we are just earthen vessels. We are Jars of Clay, we are these dusty old pottery. Sometimes I find myself, myself spending a lot of time on the clay pot. We think about these clay pots, we wash them, we feed them, we look at them constantly in the mirror, we look at them in pictures, we check and recheck we, we are constantly thinking about and worrying about them. We think my clay pot is starting to get these little lines right in here, or my clay pot is getting gray on the sides. And we are concerned with what other people think about these earthen vessels. All this attention and focus on the outside. But Paul and Timothy say the real treasure, the real value, and treasure is on the inside. It's not the fine jewel of your life. It's not sitting on your left hand. But instead, it is a gift that isn't being given from the Creator of all things. It is the gospel, the knowledge of Christ have we lost sight of the most valuable thing that we possess? Have we forgotten that the salvation of our soul is worth more than all then gaining the whole world? You know, sometimes we read about people who have lots and lots of money, celebrities. And maybe they have houses in New York and LA and down by the beach. And we think they've made it. They are successful. They have everything that a person would want in this world. But that's not real success or real treasure. As Paul said in Philippians chapter three, that he counted everything as loss for the surpassing worth of knowing price, Jesus.

Conrad Harkrider  08:07
You remember the parable that Jesus told about the man who found a treasure in the field? And Jesus said that when he found it, he was overjoyed. And he went and sold everything that he had so that he could purchase that one field. Do we value the gospel and the knowledge of Jesus Christ? Do we value that relationship with him as a treasure above everything else? In this life, we've been entrusted with such a great Tresor. Also, think with me about the idea that we are to be a blessing to the world. as God's people as children of God, we are a blessing and a promise to the world. Go with me back to Genesis chapter 12. Genesis chapter 12, as God is making a promise to Abraham making a covenant with him. In Genesis chapter 12 And verse one. It says, Now the Lord said to Abram, Get out of your country, from your family, and from your father's house to a land that I will show you I will make you a great nation. I will bless you, and make your name great and you shall be a blessing. I will bless those who bless you and I will curse him who curses you and in you, all the families of the earth shall be blessed. God tells Abraham that he's going to make him into a great nation. He's going to make his name great. And look at the end of verse two what he says, You shall be a blessing. There was a personal aspect to this, that Abraham, his life would be a blessing to the country where he lived the land where he was dwelling. And he clarifies that in verse three, because he says, I'm going to bless those who bless you, and curse those who curse you. So if you spent time with Abraham, and you were on good terms with him, and you had a good relationship with Him, God would bless you as a result of that God was going to look favorably upon you. But there's also a broader cinch sense in which Abraham would be a blessing. And that's what he says at the end of verse three, the end of verse three says, in you, all the families of the earth will be blessed, not just the people that knew Abraham and had a connection or relationship with him. But everyone living in the world, both those in the land of Canaan, and who are living elsewhere, all would be blessed. through Abraham, well, how's that going

Conrad Harkrider  10:59
to happen? How is God, how's he possibly going to bless the entire world through one person? Well, he provides some additional information. When Abraham takes his son Isaac, to offer him as a sacrifice. He says in Genesis chapter 22, and verse 16, because you have done this and have not withheld your son, your only son, I will surely bless you and I will surely multiply your offspring as the stars of heaven. And as the sand that is on the seashore, and your offspring shall possess the gate of his enemies, and in your offspring shall all the nations of the earth be blessed, because you have obeyed my voice. Notice that God is going to greatly multiply his offspring. If you've ever been to one of those remote places, maybe out in the mountains when you've been camping, and you're hundreds of miles away from the city. And you're able to look up into the sky, and you see the stars, there are stars upon stars, God tells Abraham, that's what I'm going to do for your family if they're going to be numerous. But not only are they going to be great, and number but verse 18, he says that in your offspring, or through your offspring, all the nations of the earth will be blessed. So now we see that it's, this blessing is going to come from Abraham's offspring, not just from Abraham personally, but those who come from his body. Now, before we go away from this text, I want you to notice that the word offspring is used the this is the ESV, that same word is used three times, he's going to multiply your offspring, your offspring shall possess the gate of their enemies, and then your offspring in your offspring, the nation shall be blessed. Now we look at the first one and understand that that's speaking in plural terms, multiply your offspring, that's many people. And same with the second could be seen as your offspring will possess the gate of the enemies. But then the third we typic, is often been interpreted as referring in a singular sense that's referring to one offspring that is referring to Christ. Well, let's look at another verse from Genesis, in Genesis, chapter 28, this is, as Jacob is making his way to his uncle Laden's house, and he has this dream of a ladder that's going up to heaven. And this is what God says to him. And behold, the Lord stood above it and said, I am the Lord, the God of Abraham, your father, and the God of Isaac, the land on which you lie, I will give you and your offspring, and your offspring shall be like the dust of the earth, and you shall spread abroad to the west, and to the east, and to the north, and to the south, and in you and your offspring shall all the families of the earth be blessed. Once again, God says that it's going, these blessings are going to be given to your offspring. And notice that term, your offspring is used, again three times here, to say that they are going to possess the land that they are going to be like the dust of the earth, and then through your offspring, the families of the earth will be blessed. So what does all this mean? What what point are we trying to make here? The blessing that was promised to Abraham was a blessing that would come through Jesus Christ. He was born into the family of the Jewish nation. He was an Israelite. And God used the nation of Israel to bring the Promised Messiah into the world. Jesus Christ is the blessing to the nations. But it doesn't stop there.

Conrad Harkrider  14:57
It doesn't stop there. just as Christ is the offspring of Abraham, the purpose of why he came was to make many sons and daughters of Abraham, so that there could be more children of God. He is the promise, son, but He is not the only son. And this point is made in Galatians chapter three and verse 26. It says, For in Christ Jesus, you are all sons of God through faith. For as many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ, there is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is no male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus. And if you are Christ's, then you are Abraham's offspring. heirs according to the promise, this is incredible. Paul says that those who are in Christ are now sons of God, those who have been baptized into Christ, they are all one, they are unified. There is no social status. There is no distinction between different nationalities, there's no distinction between genders, everyone is the same in Christ. And he says that if you are in Christ, then there's our phrase, again, you are Abraham's offspring. So just as Christ was the offspring of Abraham, so those who believe in Christ, those who put on Christ are now the offspring of Abraham. Okay, so why does that matter? What's the point of all this? Because the promise is still in effect. God promised that through Abraham's offspring, all the nations of the earth would be blessed. God bless the world through Christ. But we too, are the offspring of Abraham. And so God blesses the world. Through each one of us, we are a blessing to the world. My wife before becoming a full time mom, she was a high school math teacher. And that's a difficult job to say the least, teaching is not easy. But when you're teaching a subject that many kids admittedly say that they hate, then you really have your work cut out for you. But one of the things that kept her going, that helped her to stay motivated, was those students, those few students in her class that were engaged, they wanted to learn, they asked questions, they paid attention, which at times seemed like something that was very rare. They did their homework, they didn't talk when she was talking what a concept. And they were a blessing to the class, they set that example for their peers. And if those people were those types of kids, those students weren't in the class, it would no longer be teaching, it would just be babysitting controlling the chaos. Emily is nodding. What would the world look like, without Christians? What would the world be like? If you removed all of God's people from the earth? Of all people, Christians should be the ones who show generosity, and kindness and courtesy, and are willing to help. When you look in the workplace, the boss, he should say, I will, if that's a Christian, I want them working for me. Because I know what I'm gonna get. I know what type of person that's going to be. In the neighborhood. People shouldn't be saying, I want to live next to that family. Because they are courteous, they're interested, they are helpful. We should be a blessing to those around us. But it goes deeper than just being good citizens of society and helpful. It goes deeper than just providing some type of aid or assistance to others. How is it that we provide the greatest blessing to the world?

Conrad Harkrider  19:28
We see that it's through sharing what we've received. We've been entrusted with the gospel, and that means that we have a responsibility to share what we have been given in First Peter chapter four. In verse 10, it says, as each has received a gift, use it to serve one another, as good stewards of God's varied grace. Whoever speaks as one who speaks oracles of God whoever serves as one who serves by this strength that God supplies, in order that in everything, God may be glorified through Jesus Christ. God has blessed us with so many gifts. And he says here that if you have the gift of speaking, then use that gift, if you had the gift of serving than serve others with the strength that God has supplied, and all of this is done for the purpose, for what that God may be glorified through Jesus Christ, every gift that we have, should be used in service to others. And what is the greatest and most precious gift that God has entrusted us with? To share with others the knowledge and the good news of Jesus Christ. This is something that has been delivered to us and it's been freely offered to us. Do we, in turn, share it with others. My great grandfather used to live in East Texas where they had a number of pecan trees. And so every fall, he would go out into his yard, he would gather up all of the pecans and bring them inside the house. Then a couple of months later, around the holidays, we'd go out to the mail and we'd open a package and it would be a tin of pecans. And then a few weeks later, someone would have a birthday and they would go get their package from granddad and it would be a tin of pecans and he just sent them year round. That was his gift to the family. I think my mom, she felt bad throwing them away. So she just stick them in the freezer. We'd be eating pecans with everything. But I want you to imagine if instead of giving those out as gifts, if he just took those into his house, and he put them into the bathtub. And we said granddad, what are you doing with these pecans? Are you going to sell them? No? Are you going to eat them? No. Are you going to give them away? No. You? What purpose are they serving? What good are they doing sitting inside of your house? God has given us tremendous blessings. He's given us the Gospel we it's not something that we paid for, or worked for. And yet this is a gift that is wasted. It loses its purpose and its significance when it's not shared with others. This is not something that has to be stored up or hoarded away, or enjoyed only by me and my family and by my Christian friends. What we have cannot be something that we exclusively enjoy. Jesus told his disciples in Matthew chapter 10 And verse eight, Freely you have received, freely give. You didn't buy it. You didn't work for it. So be generous with it, pass it on to others. Well, as we finished the lesson this morning, I want to give you some practical ways of how we do that. First of all, we need to remember not to overcomplicate it. Sometimes we put so much pressure on telling others about the Lord. And we think that the conversion has to happen in that first 45 seconds when we're talking with someone. And we put all the emphasis and the attention and focus on ourselves that we'll be able to say the right things. But we need not make it more complicated than it is. Also, start with a question. Just ask someone. Have you ever read the Bible? Have you studied the Bible? Do you go to church somewhere? Start the conversation would you be interested in coming to a study offer an invitation. Last year we had a number of home Bible studies in people's homes. And that's a great opportunity for us to invite friends and neighbors and co workers sometimes

Conrad Harkrider  24:15
it can be kind of intimidating to come into a church building where everyone is dressed up and people know all the songs and everyone is talking and knows other people. So inviting someone into a more personal home setting. They will often say yes to that invitation rather than coming with you to church. Also build relationships, build relationships, there are people in your life and in my life, people at work people at school in the neighborhood who are isolated. They don't have anyone that talks to them or reaches out to them or or cares about them or is interested in their life. And so start a new can Action, go outside of your comfort zone and your group of friends, and invite someone else to go to lunch, invite them to come over to dinner show interest in the lives of other people. And when you lay that foundation with that relationship, people are much more likely to accept an invitation, or when you ask them about the Lord. And then finally, we need to open our eyes. This is what Jesus told his disciples when he was with the Samaritan woman. And they came back out of the city. And they said, Well, you know, why are you talking to that woman? And what food are you eating? And he looked at them and he said, open your eyes, for the fields are white, for harvest, open your eyes, we need to do a better job of thinking about the opportunities that are around us. When you get into a new situation, are you thinking about who would be interested, who would be open, who would be receptive to the gospel, you start a new school year, you get into a new job, you move into a new neighborhood. As parents, we are constantly meeting new people through our kids on the soccer field and in the classroom, we need to open our eyes and be thinking about the opportunities to share the gospel. In the book of Numbers were told about a time when there were fiery serpents that came into the cave of Israel. And after pleading with the Lord, God told Moses to make a bronze serpent and to put it up on a standard or a pole and set it out in the midst of the camp. And so it was that anyone who looked upon the bronze serpent, they found healing they were saved. I want you to imagine if you were living during that time, and you had received a bite on the arm. And there was tremendous pain, it was burning like crazy as moving from your arm up into your shoulder and down into your chest. And someone came and grabbed you and said, Come with me. And they took you out into the midst of the camp and you looked up and instantly found relief. You're overjoyed, you're relieved. After feeling this tremendous relief, you go inside of the tent, to get a drink of water, and they're lying on the ground with a bite on his leg is your brother. What do you do?

Conrad Harkrider  27:59
You see all of us come into contact with people every single day that have been bitten by the awful sting of sin. And eventually, they will die from that. Unless someone tells them unless someone shares with them that there is relief, there is remedy there is hope. Unless they are guided to a cure, which is exactly what has been done for us. The question is, will we have the courage and the love and compassion to share what we have received. We have been entrusted with the greatest of all gifts, the gospel of Jesus Christ. And I hope you see that God intends us His people to be a blessing and a healing to the nation's that we would continue to share that good news so that others can come to be sons and daughters of Abraham. We'll close this morning with an invitation if there's something that we can do to encourage you and your walk in your relationship and connection to Christ. This is a open opportunity for prayers or for one to confess their faith in Jesus Christ and to put him on in baptism. If you have a need, please come down to the front as we stand and see
