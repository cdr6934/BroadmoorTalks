Thank you all for being here tonight. stormy evening. Last time I did a, quote, full length sermon was my freshman year of college. So it's been a little bit. So we'll see if this goes for either 10 minutes or an hour, it's up to up to these notes, we'll see how that holds up. What we're going to talk about tonight, is the concept of being laser focused on something. Right. So this idea has become more and more apparent to me over the last several years. And in a really simple event that drove this point home recently, was when I was mowing the lawn recently, a couple weeks ago. So as I was cutting the grass, I turned to look at a passing car. And it was a new Mustang. So I couldn't resist, look over. It goes by, look back to where I'm headed. And I'm completely off course I've cut into the air I haven't been to yet I was a zigzag. And it wasn't, it was not a pretty picture. But I lost focus, I became distracted, something else took my attention away from what I was doing took away my focus, I was the task at hand. So the idea of being laser focused on something isn't anything new. When you're laser focused on a single purpose, your chances of accomplishing that goal or that vision increase dramatically. I'm gonna go through some actual studies that have been done about that later on. But I'm just that idea of harnessing energy and attention to something. So achieving anything of value whether it's physically or spiritually or financially, or anything else is rarely, if ever easy. It's not easy to do important or big things. And no one would say that their struggles are easy when they're accomplishing those things. And Matthew seven, verse 13, through 14, if you want to turn over there, so we're going to start tonight

Jonathan Wickersheim  02:29
Matthew seven, beginning in verse 13, is Jesus speaking. Enter by the narrow gate, for the gate is wide in the way is easy, that leads to destruction. And those who enter by it are many For the gate is narrow, and the way is hard that leads to life. And those who find it are few. This wide path in life, not just spiritually speaking, but it's easy, it's smooth. And dare I say it's slightly downhill, it's comfortable. Most of the time you can coast doesn't take much effort to go that way. It's a lot of room as the path of least resistance. And it's the most accommodating. And the vast majority walk that way. Those who enter by it are many Jesus says the path to destruction. And again, you can apply that to things spiritually, financially, physically, mentally, socially, easy things tend to not accomplish much. It's easy to sit on the couch, it's easy to do nothing. It's easy to not stand up for what you believe in. When you look around to see how you're doing while you're you're par for the course, because most folks are walking that way. In contrast to that, goals of important things that we place value, those are often difficult, very difficult to obtain. narrow is the gate that leads to life and the path that leads to it is difficult to walk in verse 1314, Matthew seven for the gate is narrow in the way it's hard.

Jonathan Wickersheim  04:30
It's uphill versus down and it's narrow versus wide. You often feel alone on that path. I should have put a picture up for this. But if you seen one of those steep mountain roadways, was enough for like maybe half a car, people driving on it. switchbacks all the way up. That's hard. If you're actually a mountain climber going on the edge of a mountain is hard. I remember last time we went up, mount the client, we went up, I think it was Boulevard. And at one point, there was nothing but you a little bit of rocks, and something to hold on to. That's about it. But the rewards at the top are worth that climb. Even more so the person that we become on those journeys often make that journey itself worth the reward itself. Paul, when he was writing to the Philippians, of turnover, the Philippians chapter, chapter number two, or three, sorry, Philippians three and verse, verse 11, starting. So Paul is talking about this journey that he is on, on this narrow path. Philippians three, verse 11. That by any means possible, I may have, I may attain the resurrection from the dead. Not that I've already obtained this, or I'm already perfect, but I press on. But I press on to make it my own because Christ Jesus has made me his own brothers that did not consider that I have made it my own. But one thing I do, forgetting what lies behind and straining forward to what lies ahead, I press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God and Christ Jesus in heaven, and from it, we wait We await a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ. She's talking about this this journey that he's on, he hasn't reached it yet. He hasn't made it to the gate. He's on that narrow path, and that everything he has is striving for that upward goal. And again in First Corinthians turn over there first Corinthians chapter nine. Beginning in verse 24, First Corinthians 924 Do you not know that in a race all the runners run but only one receives the prize? So run that you may attain it? Every athlete exercise and self control and all things that they do it to receive a perishable wreath, but we an imperishable? So why do you not run aimlessly that is without a goal or without purpose? I do not box as one beating the air, punching it nothing. But I discipline my body and I keep it under control. Lest after preaching to others, I myself should be disqualified. We see in this example Paul's using he's talking about focus. What are you? What are you racing for? What are you boxing for? Is there zero reason Are you being aimless in your work, the past and that narrow gate we talked about? That requires sacrifice and self control discipline stored that Paul uses, you often have to give up things to obtain it. And it's not just giving up bad habits or, or meaningless things that are often good things that we forego in order to achieve something that's worthwhile to achieve something of value. Paul gave up a position of status and a position of power and influence in order to accept his mission of the gospel and that God had given him. Couldn't Paul have done more? As a respected you in Israel? What do you have carried more weight, when that made more sense to continue doing what he was doing where he was? But now Paul gave up all that when he was commissioned take the Gospel into the world, not only gave up status, and gave up position and ability, but he accepted the hard road, the narrow road, persecution, sleepless nights hunger, shipwreck all for the sake of pleasing his master.

Jonathan Wickersheim  09:11
And Hebrews 12 Verse 11.

Jonathan Wickersheim  09:20
Hebrews 12, verse 11, says, No discipline seems pleasant at the time, but painful. Later on, however, it produces a harvest of righteousness and peace for those who have been trained by it. So in those times, when Paul was being threatened by arrest, or beating or even death, all of that was for the sake of pleasing his master. Good made him the steward of the good news of Jesus. Now, I realize when when Paul's talking about discipline here in Hebrews, he's talking about the discipline of God and shaping our character that when we come through persecution difficulty, it's to hone us and shape us into something better. But no one reaches the top of their metal metaphorical mountain and says, Well, that was easy. Or that just happened by accident. I don't even know how I ended up here on top of Mount McConnell, there was I just was walking one day and here I am. No. But what people will say is that that journey shaped who they are now. It made what they're doing now possible. The difficult path, the narrow path, trial by fire, often the term people use, taught them discipline, how to strive forward. Turn Paul used, how to do hard things, difficult things, things worthwhile. Thinking what it takes to become a doctor for a second fuel. The path on the way to becoming a doctor really starts as early as middle school and high school. What are your grades? What are you involved in? What are your extra extra curricular activities involved in? Where are you going with this? I don't know many doctors who finished high school with a 2.0 average right now, but people who continue to strive for something that long off, have dedicated themselves to something takes years of study long shifts, hundreds of 1000s of dollars in many cases, sacrificing or delaying other life goals, families, marriage, you name it, social life. But once their path is complete, once they've put in that time on the hard path, degree in hand, what an impact they'll have on the lives of others. No discipline seems pleasant at the time, but later produces a harvest. So we know how to please our master just as as Paul was pleasing his master, we know what to do. When we come here we study we learn we, we read, we pray we serve we know the things to do that would make God pleased with us and the life that we lead. But why is it hard? Why do we stumble? Why do we struggle with things? Think of it like like working out becoming physically fit. We all know how to do it. We all know what to do. You know how to lose weight, the beast better to build muscle or endurance for a race. We know mentally you eat healthy, you don't eat junk food. You exercise you sweat, you lift weights, get up early, you get the proper amounts of sleep, etc, etc. We know that I mean there's pick up any book anywhere, it's probably got something about how to be physically fit these days. But if we all know how to be fit, why don't we all just look like Olympic athletes? Why is it I cannot run a marathon because to become a gold medalist or to look like Captain America. It takes a level of discipline that most people are not willing to obtain. I don't know if any of you have done any kind of looking into the regiment or the diet and the workout routines for some of these athletes of what they do. It's incredible. And so as Jesus teaches that the life that leads to the narrow gate, the difficult path, most aren't willing to seek it much less Wocket. Now being physically, financially, spiritually or mentally fit takes discipline. Paul's talking about that. And even more importantly, to actually achieve something you have to focus. We have a lot of energy and a lot of potential and every single one of us, but we only have so many hours in the day, and we only have so much time to give. So where are we going to focus ourselves. Again, like I mentioned earlier, any any goal of significance or anything of value is difficult to obtain.

Jonathan Wickersheim  14:19
You don't accidentally become an Olympic athlete and accidentally beat Michael Phelps and 100 meter swim doesn't happen on accident. I mentioned the regiment that athletes put in to become successful to win the prize, the level of focus that they have to have. Michael Phelps is the most decorated Olympian ever at this point, maybe someone will come along for him and granted you can talk about how the rules have changed and more sports and more potential but whatever. Michael Phelps put in a lot of focus and effort to be where he is. So I did a little bit of Googling, right. found out what his workout routine look like how much he was having to sleep and eat and spending time swimming in order to be where he is in order to achieve something. Talk about a hard road. In order to achieve that prize at the end of the race, Michael Phelps had laser focus not just in the pool, but long, long before then, that was his goal was a metal. But in order to achieve that, to focus, nothing could pull him away from that. sunup until sundown was focused on technique, improving push off strengthening arms and legs for the day of the race, practice, practice practice. Six hours a day, he said on average, he spent looking at the bottom of a pool about 50 miles a week, he would swim, the distance he would cover. I don't know if he'll walk that much in a month. Phelps said that he gave up a lot in order to be where he is. So six hours a day training seven days a week, couple hours a day for eating his 12,000 calorie diet. I don't even know how much that is. That's a lot of food. It was a picture of you can go look it up. It's a huge table. No social life, no hobbies, no relationships to speak of no other sports to excel at. He could have been great at a lot of things. But his focus was on winning that race.

Jonathan Wickersheim  16:45
The path to eternal life is full of uphill battles and sacrifices. And it won't happen on accident. Spiritually speaking, no, receiving a crown of life is different than an athlete earning metal there's nothing that we can do to to earn salvation or to earn that crown. But giving up our own desires in order to enter that narrow gate. We can't take baggage full of our wants and our pride and our desires. There's just enough room for me. The strip down, Christ focused me anything else just won't fit. Like I said, entering that gate. It's not going to happen on accident. Everyday we get to choose will I walk the wide and easy path serving myself rather than others? Well, I serve myself rather than my family, or my brethren or serve myself rather than my master. Or well, I choose the narrow path, the difficult path, to give up me time to spend with my family, to submit to the will of my spouse, the will of my spouse, to heed the counsel of an elder to withdraw from a wayward Christian to meditate more on God's Word, to give up me, and to care for the sick and the needy, to give up me and to say no to self and the indulgence of the physical here now. walk the narrow path that leads to life. One of the things that makes it hard to walk that narrow path is Life is full of distractions. And living in the day and time we live in the country we live in now more than ever that can bring home we have more free time than ever before. But yet we seem to have no time more than ever before. It's an interesting paradox. So this year, I missed New Year's kind of interested in that. But I miss New Years. I was ready to shout who re DJ right? If you're here for that, and that won't make sense. Women that came in 2018. But we were playing a game over in the corner with the family not paying attention. We lost track of time. TV was off, and we're going to come and turn it on and watch the ball drop in the festivities and ring in the new year. But as you played our game 1212 o'clock came and it went and none of us even noticed. Around 1202 We realized what had happened scrambling in the living room flipped the TV on trying to find the right channel. But it was over. We missed it. The ball had dropped smoking the fireworks had cleared. Reporters are winding things down. The New Year Wood was already on us. Now granted, none of us are very heartbroken over that. We were enjoying our game and we really quick went back to it. Nope, no prob But it goes to illustrate, if we let something else distract us from our focus from our goal, we're very likely to miss that target altogether. Now, we've been serious laser focused on watching the ball drop in New York, at the stroke of 12. The TV will not have enough, we would not have been playing a game in the other room, we would have set an alarm to remind us, hey, New Year's is coming, you might want to give yourself a few minutes to find the right channel, John. And everything about that night would have been geared toward that moment, but it wasn't. And that's okay. But that wasn't our focus. Our focus was to be with family and to win at Settlers of Catan because I hadn't won in a long time. And I was intense on that that was my focus. So most of our distractions, they come from the pleasure of the hearing now, what are we looking at, we lose sight of longer term aspirations because of noise. We lose our focus, we let the pleasure of drugs or sex or alcohol or earthly riches or selfishness distract us from our goal of heaven. We let short term happiness obtained from eating that extra piece of pizza or cake or ice cream or taking an extra hour of sleep. pull us away from our physical or goal of physical fitness. We let the mindset of buy it now pay for it later. Keep us financially strapped and stressed. We live entertainment like movies and TV and sports. Netflix, take away our time rather than using it for, for meditating on God's word, or for spending time with family or other worthwhile activities. That is the easy and wide and normal way.

Jonathan Wickersheim  21:46
I keep using this term laser laser focus talked about that's kind of going to be a theme for tonight. In life, like I mentioned, we have this whirlwind of activity. And you've got to address it, I've got to get up and I've got to go to work, I need to keep the house clean, I've got to take the trash out. Kids need to be fed, things need to happen, I have to read an either workout, check the news or look like an idiot when I go into work. Through the laundry prep for Bible study. Try to get back on track with my 25 New Year's resolutions that I made. And things just get caught up. I mentioned I was gonna talk about a study done about focus and being intentional. You may or may not have heard of a company called Franklin Covey. It's a company focused on organizational leadership and productivity. And they've done studies on 1000s of teams and organizations across the globe. And they found this and one of their focus studies focus on less in order to accomplish more. Focus on less in order to accomplish more Well, that just seemed backwards. Don't need to focus on a lot of things so I can get a lot of things done. So they coined this term, wig Wi G, not a wig wearer but an acronym for wildly important goal. If you're in the corporate world, maybe you've come across this term at a team meeting or someone brought it up to you and a focus group at work. I don't know. First time I heard it was at work, wildly important goal. What's our wig, John? You tell me you're the boss. So this wildly important goal they talked about in the book of four disciplines. The idea behind this is that in addition to this whirlwind of activity, things gotta handle, you got to take care of those things. But the more goals that you set, the more you have to juggle, the more you have to do, the more your attention is your focus is split, the more overwhelmed you become. And little to nothing actually gets accomplished. But when you have a wildly important goal, when you have a focus, you are far more likely to accomplish it. So in their study, if an organization or an individual had two to three primary goals or objectives they were trying to complete to achieve they were likely to achieve two to three of those goals. If they had three to 10 primary goals, they were likely to achieve one, maybe two of those goals. And if they had 11 or more goals, they were unlikely to achieve even one of them. And if they did, it was done poorly. So let me ask you this. What is your wildly important goal? Now somebody's got a wildly important goal. First one that came to my mind was was Joshua. He had a laser focus on a single purpose and we really didn't get this until the end of his life. We saw it. But he came right out and said it at the end of his life. Joshua 24 and verse 15, if you want to flip over there

Jonathan Wickersheim  25:16
Josh are 24 and 15. Again, at the end of his life, we learned what had driven him to take all the actions he had in the wilderness, and to stand against the 10 other spies and to stand even against his nation. And he has this statement. As for me in my house, we will serve the Lord. The path that Joseph that Joshua walked was not easy. It wasn't wide, it wasn't downhill. And it wasn't filled by the masses. He stood with one other person, or one other spy, at the foot of Canaan ready to walk the narrow path, even if it meant walking alone. So what's your focus? Too often we find ourselves just coasting. Just take wherever the wind leaves us, with their family or with their finances or with our walk with Christ. We say well, it's just how it is I can't I can't change it to to I am or there's no point it's too big. One of the most influential professors at Florida College said, If you never set a goal, you will achieve it every time. Took me a minute when I was 19 years old. If you never set a goal, you will achieve it every time. That is to say you will get nowhere. If you aim at nothing, you hit nothing. Zero plus zero equals zero. But when you have a laser focus to achieve something you can achieve anything. And you look at every other decision through that lens. When Joshua had to face the other, the other spies or the Face the Nation of what they were going to do and what they were about to say to take the take the land. He made all of his decisions through that lens. That was his single focus in life. As for me in my house, we'll serve the Lord. As God's steward our mission can be summed up into question, Will this please my master? Will this serve the Lord? When you have laser focus, you can achieve anything. Have plans have goals? In the parable of the talents, on the three stewards in Matthew 25, go on turn over there. You're welcome Tim. Just gonna mention one thing about it. The one he was given the five talents, said that he went at once and went and traded, started working. He knew what his master would want. He had a focus on serving his master and being prudent with what he was given. Also, there's a contrast between the first two stewards, and the third. The first you had an aim to please the master. Will this please my master? How will this best serve my master. The third wasn't so much focused on pleasing the master, but rather avoiding retribution. That was his main focus. Don't do something that will get you punished or make the master angry. Whereas the first two are aiming to please their master with the blessings that they had been afforded to manage? What's your focus? Is our focus on pleasing the master whose possessions we manage? Is our focus on pleasing the master and whose family we've been blessed with. Is our focus on pleasing the master to share the gospel of the Son he willingly gave to us. How are you doing it that oh my doing it that was discipline ourselves in order to be useful tools for the Lord service. Now realize there's a little bit of a difference between setting a goal and having a vision on something with a goal. It's it's attainable, it's a checkbox. I'm going to take steps in order to get there. But if that phrase of will I please my master? That's more of a vision. That lens that we focus all of our decisions through Colossians three and verse one. Scope of thoughts here as we wrap up.

Jonathan Wickersheim  30:08
If then you have been raised with Christ, seek Set your minds on the things that are above where Christ is seated on the right hand of God and Matthew six, verse 33. But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness, all these things will be added to you. Seek first the Kingdom. Focus on less in order to accomplish more. walk the narrow path even though it is difficult and have a laser focus on accomplishing goals for the master. Painfully all along that wide and easy path, the downward sloping path of least resistance. There are turn offs leading back to the narrow gate. You're not cut off

Jonathan Wickersheim  31:08
and if you know that you're on that path, you're on this wide path leading to destruction. God has given you an opportunity to walk down the narrow path. Yes, it's hard. It'll be difficult, it's uphill. You're gonna fall you're gonna trip. But God's given us His Son and each other to accomplish that. So tonight, you have an opportunity to turn on to that path. And as we talked about the very beginning of this, any goal worthwhile is difficult to achieve and to obtain. So there's anything that we can do to help you on that path, whether you're on it and you feel stuck, or if you realize need to be on it. And this is the time to make your life right to begin walking that path and to come forward now as we stand and see how we can help you
