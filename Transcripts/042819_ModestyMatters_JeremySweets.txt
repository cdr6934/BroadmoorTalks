Good morning. It's good to see everyone here today, certainly good that we can come here and worship together and be able to look at a portion of God's word, which is what we plan to do at this time. You know, when you get married, when you care about someone, you try to learn what matters to them, what is important to them. And as you first get married, that's kind of a learning process, understanding what kind of things they like to do their interests, but also learning the things that might bother them, maybe the some of the things that you do. And so you try to learn what matters to them, because you care about that person. You know, we're really to do the same thing with God as well. And what sad to say is that our culture in many ways, disregards God, and they disregard the things that matter to God. And we can talk about many things when we're talking about that subject about the things that the world disregards. But I'd like to look at this morning, modesty, I think that is one area that the world has disregarded. It's one area that the world has said, that's simply not important to us. And so let's look at the Bible and see what it has to say and I think we can learn some valuable lessons. I believe the Bible teaches that modesty matters, it matters. Well, let's look at a couple of passages. We'll start in First Timothy chapter two. First Timothy chapter two. As we look at First Timothy, one of the context here, particularly chapter two is is worship and prayer. In verse one, he says, first of all, then I urge that supplications, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings, be made for all people, for kings and all who are in high positions that they that we may lead a peaceable and quiet life godly and dignified in every way. In the first few verses of chapter two, Paul talks about the content of prayer, the contents of prayer, what are Christians to be praying about. But as he comes to verses eight through 15, he begins to talk about the manner of prayer, the manner of prayer, we also see that the context of worship is in mind we see that from Chapter Three after he talks about the elders and the deacons. He says, I want to come to you. But if I am, the late I'm writing these things, so that you may know how one ought to conduct himself in the household of God, which is the church of the living God the pillar in support of truth. There Paul says that I want you to understand how you conduct yourself, how you conduct yourself, as an in the church as you gather together. So I believe that is the context that he is talking about. So now he starts off with some instruction to men in verse eight, chapter, First Timothy two verse eight.

Jeremy Sweets  02:57
I desire then that in every place, the men should pray, lifting up holy hands without anger or quarrel. As I mentioned, he's already talked about what we should be praying about. Now he talks about how men he says here are to pray lifting up holy hands. Prayer should come from sincere hearts, they should come from hearts that are seeking to do God's will to seeking seeking to follow after Him. It is simply hypocritical to think that we can pray to God when we want, and yet live however we want. Now, Paul says when you pray, lift up holy hands, and goes on to say that this is to be without anger or quarreling. Men are to approach God in a pure way with holy hands, but also not in a domineering way. Sometimes men think that they show leadership by domination, by anger by quarreling by proving that they are right by over running others and Paul says, That is not to be the case. Next, Paul has some instructions for the women. When he says in verse nine, likewise, in like manner, also that women should adorn themselves in respectable apparel, with modesty and self control, not with braided hair and gold or pearls or costly attire, but what what, but with what is proper for women who profess godliness with good works? Let a woman learn quietly with all submissiveness do not permit a woman to teach or to exercise authority over a man rather she has to remain quiet, For Adam was formed first than Eve, and Adam was not deceived, but the woman was deceived and became a transgressor. Yet she'll be saved through childbearing if they continue in faith and love and holiness. with self control, notice that the instruction here is that women should adorn themselves, they should adorn themselves. The word for adorn simply means to put on, it's to beautify with decoration here. And so the idea here is that she should adorn herself with good works, not with expensive or gaudy clothes. The point is not to wear clothes in such a way that everyone will notice me and notice how stylish I am and notice how wealthy I am and notice me, but rather the adornment to be put on according to Paul is good works. That is what truly beautifies that is what truly is important. And so he says, to put on respectable apparel with modesty and self control, not the braided hair and gold or pearls or costly attire, but what is proper for women who profess godliness with good works. He goes on to say also that, in conjunction with that women are to learn, they are not to be put aside, they are not to simply leave the learning up to the men but they are to learn, they're to learn from the scriptures, but there is a manner or way in which they are to do that. And the text says that they are to do that in quiet submission, not in I can paraphrase boisterous insubordination, not by again demanding their way and coming out over top, not by teaching over a man. And so we see from First Timothy Chapter Two here, they are to adorn themselves, and they are to learn they are to learn. Let me just point out as well that the instruction here is first given to men, and then it's given to women. But as we talk about modesty, I want you to know that this is an area that is needed for for both genders. The instruction given to men and women seems to be an areas maybe of proclivity or natural needs, but the need for godly character really applies to both. So we can't say that voice tells the wet the men not to be angry, and it's okay for women to be angry. That's not his point. No, he's talking particularly to the man for something that might affect them more. But he talks to the women as well, that they are to have a godly character that comes out in even their dress and their actions as well. And that's true of men to men need to have that godly character and it will be displayed in dress as well.

Jeremy Sweets  07:58
Well, let's notice one other passage in First Peter chapter three, First Peter, chapter three, verses one through seven. And this is a similar passage with some similar instructions, but it has a different context and a difference. Really, slightly different teaching there. First, Peter three,

Jeremy Sweets  08:21
verses one through seven. Now, the context deals with submission. You might notice in chapter two and verse 13, he says, be subject to every human institution for the Lord's sake. So submit to government. Then he says in verse 18, of chapter two servants be subject to your masters. And he's going to mention that these may be masters that are not acting as they should. These may be even unbelievers, they may not treat you the way you should. But you also you need to submit in that case. And in chapter three, he says to the wives be subject to your husbands. And it may be that these husbands are not believers. They says, you still need to submit subject yourself. There seems to be a common thread of submitting here even to non believers and what is needed in that now that may bring about suffering. And you can see that in each one of these examples. And as Paul explains or extrapolates upon this topic, he begins to talk about suffering, which may come in the dealings with non believers. But notice in chapter three and verse one, likewise, wives be subject. The likewise refers to the subjection, which is the topic that he's been talking about. Likewise, wives be subject to your own husbands, so that even if some do not obey the word, they may be one without a word by the conduct of their wives, when they see your respectful, impure conduct, do not let your adorning be external the braiding of hair You're in the putting on a gold jewelry or the clothing you wear. But let your adorning be the hidden Person of the heart with the imperishable beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit, which in God's sight is very precious. For this is how the holy women who hoped and God used to adorn themselves by submitting to their own husbands, as Sara obeyed Abraham calling him Lord, and you are her children, if you do good and do not fear, anything that is frightening. Likewise, husbands live with your wives in an understanding way, showing honor to the woman as the weaker vessel, since they are heirs with you of the grace of life so that your prayers may not be hindered. In First Timothy, he addresses the men and women he starts with the men. And here he talks about particularly husbands and wives and he starts with the wives, the instruction he gives to the wives that they that they are to be subject to their own husbands, but notice that they are to be subjects, their husbands through godly behavior, through respect and pure conduct. In fact, if their husbands are not Christians, they can be one, they can be persuaded, but the persuasion that has to take place is not through nagging. It is through godly conduct. It is not through overt sexuality, it is through godly conduct, ones be subject through respect and pure conduct. Here he again, he's going to tell the wives to adorn themselves. And that word again means to decorate or to beautify, it's to put on something in order to bring that about, but notice what he says what you are to adorn, he says to adorn the inner person, not the outer person, you are to adorn your heart, you are not to put on and place an emphasis on this extravagant kind of clothing or clothing that stands out or clothing that might cause the husband to to look at that and take notice. But rather the adornment is to be of the heart, to be of the heart. What is on the inside is truly important. Not only that, but he says to adorn yourselves in submission, in verses five through six, he says for this is how holy women who hoped and God used to adorn themselves by submitting to their own husbands by submitting. And so the adornment, the beauty that can be seen in a wife is in her godly character, and in her willing to some willingness to submit herself to her husband. And that is what God desires here. And we see that that was true of Sarah and is to be emulated today. Now he talks about husbands and verse seven. And just as wives are not to, not to focus on the outside, but they are to focus on their heart and pure conduct. Husbands also need instructions when dealing with their wives. Yes, they are to lead but it's not to lead through tyranny. It's not to lead through demands, it's not to lead by demanding service of another. In fact, it's just the opposite. Husbands are to be servants of their wives. And here it calls upon them to live in an under standing way, showing her honor, husbands should not lead by demanding, but by serving, not by saying you're less than me and I'm greater, but rather by submitting humbling and saying You are worthy of honor. You see the difference in how a husband is to lead and how he is to treat his wife. subjection, hear very clearly does not mean inferiority. She is a fellow heir of the grace of life and she has to be honored for for carrying out her role before God. And so I didn't advance the slide there. But husbands live in an understanding way, showing honor. So I wanted to run through those two passages real quick to simply point out, both of them talk about adorning. Both of them talk about what we are to wear what we are to emphasize what is truly important. I think that these passages tell us that modesty matters, modesty matters. So how does it matter and what is to be involved in this modesty? Well, first of all, it's a matter of character ma The state is a matter of character.

Jeremy Sweets  15:03
Modesty is often associated only really with the type of clothing maybe that someone wears. And that's certainly involved in the discussion here. But modesty begins in the heart. And that's where the discussion of modesty should begin as well. It is a virtue. It's a characteristic. It is an attitude that eventually, maybe I don't know if eventually, but it displays itself or it comes out in both actions and dress. And so the heart is the first thing that needs to be addressed when we talk about this. This is most clearly seen in First Peter chapter three and verse four. First Peter three and verse four. There it says, but let your adorning be the hidden Person of the heart, with the imperishable beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit, which in God's sight is very precious. Notice the adorning, the emphasis is upon the heart. The godly woman has a beautiful heart, a beautiful character. And she is not to place as much emphasis really on the outside, that's fleeting, that comes and goes, but what is on the inside is what is truly important. So focus on that let your adorning be there, let your emphasis be there, on the adorning of your heart, that can be a beautiful thing. And there are talks about the imperishable beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit. And not only that, but it is precious in God's sight. That is what God cares about. So that is what we should care about. Tim Charlie's is a blogger, he wrote an article on modesty talking about the heart of modesty. And he defined modesty this way, and I kind of liked the way he said it, so I'm gonna borrow it. Modesty is a virtue that shows love to others, and brings glory to God through appropriate dress. It begins with the hearts, it deals with our relations to others, it deals with bringing glory to God. And it does that through dress, although we might even could add it does it through our our actions and attitudes as well. But here he says that it is a virtue. It is a matter of character. Modesty includes a humble regard for oneself. In fact, you've seen a bragger talk about what they've done, what they've accomplished. They're not modest about their accomplishments are they they want everyone to know and they want to tell somebody but a modest person or in regards to what they've done. They don't say that they're the biggest and the best and want everybody to know it, but they downplay that. There is a modesty in their heart and then their character, and so a modest character eliminates pride. A modest character eliminates vanity, a modest character does away with egotism, and boastfulness, these are all heart problems, aren't they?

Jeremy Sweets  18:20
A modest character removes pretension, extravagance, ostentation and even rebellion or insubordination. A modest heart removes those things a modest heart is a humble heart. We can see a couple of these traits in First Timothy chapter two and verse nine. First Timothy chapter two and verse nine. There says likewise, also that women should adorn themselves with respectable apparel. The NET Bible says suitable clothing what is suitable. And then it says with modesty and self control with modesty and self control, the word modesty there means modesty or reverence or respect. It's also translated in the King James Version is shame, face cydnus. Often we associate shame with something that is wrong, but here it's used in a positive sense of, of having an appropriate sense of decorum, we might say, having an appropriate sense of, of propriety, of decency. And it's actually translated as propriety in the New King James Version. So you might think of this word as the opposite of everything that we just talked about. This kind of modesty is the opposite of pride and vanity, it's the opposite of ostentatious and extravagance. It's the opposite of boastfulness. You not only says that you are to dress in modesty, but he also says with some have control. You know, the mantra of today is if you've got it, flaunt it. The mantra of today is express yourself, don't let others hold you back. But But the scripture says when it comes to our clothing, it shouldn't be we do whatever we want. It shouldn't be expressing whatever we have on our hearts or minds and simply being unfiltered. But rather, the tech says that women should adorn themselves with suitable clothing with modesty and self control, self control, because it looks for what is good for others, and is not merely concerned with what one wants. And so we see this self control is also important. So if modesty is a character issue, if it is a matter of the heart, then that will automatically do away with some sayings that we often hear associated with modesty. Have you heard the world talk about modesty, they say if you've got it, flaunt it, they say show it. Let's say my body, my choice. The world says you can't tell me what to wear, it's my body, I'll wear what I want. If others have a problem with my clothing, that's their problem, and not mine. Those are not Christian attitudes. The Christian doesn't say, I will do what I want, and others will have to deal with it. The Christian seeks to serve others, even for going rights that they may have, in order to serve other people, their Christian is, is extremely concerned with others, and not so much concerned with themselves. So right away, we can see that we'll remove that kind of language and that kind of attitude from our hearts. This just makes me comfortable. This is simply what I want. I've always done that. That's really not what's at issue. That's not what's most important. Second of all, I would suggest that modesty is a matter of emphasis. It's a matter of emphasis. Is there any wonder what the world emphasizes? Is there any wonder what the world holds as important? You know, I believe our culture has fallen into the same trap that Paul describes in Romans chapter one. He says they've having exchanged the truth about God for a lie and worshipped and served the creature rather than the Creator. Our culture is saturated with sex, and obsessed with the human body. And this emphasis can be seen, I probably don't even have to tell you, you understand and know 101 ways in which this is true. But it's seen in the billboards that line our interstates for bars, plastic surgery, and really any other kind of advertisement. It's seen in the $6 billion porn industry. It's seen in magazines that line the supermarket checkout aisles that promise that you can have a bikini body in just five easy steps. It's in the magazines that obsess over celebrity, and talk about the most outrageous outfits that were worn on this or that red carpet. It's seen in cheerleaders and dance teams at athletic events and professional sports. It's seen in the Sports Illustrated Swimsuit issue, the ESPN body issue where athletes take off all their clothes and, and and pose for pictures. And it's said to be done in a tasteful way is how they mark it that are bought. Our culture is obsessed, obsessed, and it's not healthy. It's not healthy. So that's what the world emphasizes. But what does God emphasize what is important to God? In First Samuel chapter 16, and verse seven is the next king was being selected. And there was some, maybe hesitation, is it this one? Is it the next one and and Samuel states, what God values and it's not the firstborn and it's not necessarily gorgeous looks there? He says in First In First Samuel 16 Seven. For the Lord sees not as man sees Man looks on the outward appearance, but the Lord looks on the heart. What Does God care about? God cares about our hearts. And also say I mentioned this to Jessica on the way here that Emily Brandt has a CD of songs where she sings scripture, I couldn't hardly read the Scripture without hearing your voice. And that's a good thing. That means that's effective.

Jeremy Sweets  24:47
God looks on our hearts. That's what God cares about. But we far too often care and obsess over the outside. God is most concerned with our hearts This can be seen in our two passages when in this construction, it says not this, but this. So go back to First Timothy chapter two and verse nine. First Timothy chapter two and verse nine. Here says you're to adorn yourselves and he says respectable or suitable clothing or apparel, not with braided hair and gold or pearls or costly attire, that is not to be the emphasis that is not the focus of adornment. And these items seem to be associated with some kind of really some kind of extravagance. I don't think Paul is prohibiting braided hair, namely, my daughter loves to braid hair. It's not restricting gold, I have a little bit of gold on my finger right here. But what it is talking about is an obsession of focus and emphasis on clothes, on clothes in such a way that it would grab attention that others might think highly of us and respect us. You know, it almost takes me back to high school, when the most important thing was whether you had that designer label on your clothes, or whether it was a certain type of clothes. That was a paramount importance. And some people have not outgrown High School, have they? They still focus on that. And that can be a danger to us. And so he says, not with braided hair and gold or pearls or costly attire, but with what is proper for women who profess godliness with good works. Where is our emphasis? Is it in on the outside how we look? Or is it on the inside with our character and our good works? And I mentioned that Paul, I don't think is prohibiting any kind of any kind of adornment that we might do physically. I don't think he's prohibiting that. But I do think that he is talking about it in the same way talks about exercise and first things the chapter four and verse eight, it can have a little benefit. But godliness has great benefits. So those things might could help a little bit, but we have to keep them in perspective. We have to keep them in perspective. It's not our focus. It's not our focus. And so we see the best adornment for a godly woman is good works is good works. Well notice in First Peter chapter three verses three and four, he uses the same not but construction. In First Peter chapter three, verses three through four.

Jeremy Sweets  27:56
It says Do not let your adorning be external, the braiding of hair and putting on of gold jewelry or the clothing you wear. But let your adorning be the hidden Person of the heart with the imperishable beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit, which in God's sight is very precious. Do not place your emphasis. Do not place your obsession Do not place your primary care on what you look like. That's not what's most important, but rather place it on what he says in verse four. But let your adorning be the hidden Person of the heart with the imperishable beauty of a gentle and quiet spirit, which in God's sight is precious, very precious. Notice that he says in verse four, let your adorning be the hidden Person of the hearts. We might contrast that with what is seen with what is showy, with what everyone notices. It's not to be the loud clothing that are seen by everybody. It is to be the hidden Person of the hearts. Notice Furthermore, he says in verse four, it is the imperishable beauty. The focus is on the character, the imperishable beauty. What happens to external beauty? What happens? Well, some of us never had it. And for others that have it, it goes away. Right. It perishes. We get old, we get wrinkly, we lots of things happen, right? We lose our beauty on the outside. But here he says and talks about our character is an imperishable be imperishable beauty is not something that decays and fades away, but actually it grows stronger. We can become more beautiful as we age and we do that by focusing on the right thing by having a A beautiful character. In Proverbs 31 And verse 30. There it says, Charm is deceitful and beauty is vain. But a woman who fears the Lord is to be praised, is to be praying. And so we see that it is the hidden, not necessarily the scene, it is the imperishable, not the perishable beauty. And he goes on again to say it is the gentle and quiet spirit. It's not the loud, boisterous Look at me. It's not the demanding of attention from my clothes, but rather,

Jeremy Sweets  30:38
it's a gentle and quiet spirit, that steadily and simply seeks to follow after God. And that is the emphasis. That is what truly is important. Let me add a couple other quick ideas on this emphasis. It's not only an emphasis or shouldn't only be an emphasis for how we view ourselves what true beauty is, and how we adorn ourselves, but it should be an emphasis on how we consider others. How do you choose your friends? Is it based upon the clothes they wear, how good they look the amount of money they have? Or if they're beautiful people? That sounds shallow, and it is, and it's how many people choose their friends? Or should we prioritize godly hearts. Now, it doesn't matter how you look to God. And it shouldn't matter so much to us, as well. And so we see that in friendship. But let me also suggest that as we are, as young people are dating or looking for spouses, that this should be your emphasis as well. You should emphasize the character of a person over what they look like. Now, there's some unnatural traction that is there, and should be in a husband and wife and there's nothing wrong with that. But character is of utmost importance. Upon primary importance, please place your emphasis there. As you look for a godly spouse. Not only is it a matter of emphasis, it's also a matter of influence a matter of influence. You know, Peters just instructed wives not to place their emphasis upon precious jewels and precious clothes, but what is he talked about that is precious there. Instead, he directs them to something else that is precious, a gentle and quiet spirit is precious in God's sights, you know, we have an influence with other people, other people see us, and we have an influence there. The question is not whether we will influence others, but how do we want to be remembered? How do we want to be known? How do we want to influence others? The enmart, the in modest person wants to be noticed, because of their looks, because of their style. The M modest person wants to be elevated in the eyes of others. The in modest person is focused on themselves.

Jeremy Sweets  33:17
But what about the modest person? The modest person is not focused on self, but on God. The modest person seeks to do good works, and why do they seek to do those good works is it so that they can be glorified so that they can receive a pat on the back? Know the godly woman will seek to do good work so that their lights might shine so that others may see their good works and give glory to God in heaven? Matthew five and verse 16, the godly woman and man seeks to do what is precious in God's sights? You know, we're so wrapped up with and concern about how others view us? Do they think I'm stylish? Do they think I'm pretty? Do they think this about me, our focus is in the wrong place. And as long as we have that focus, we're likely to be miserable. There are supermodels asking the same question, Am I pretty enough? Am I good enough? Do people think this to me, and they obsess because they've got their priorities out of place. As long as we're focused on ourselves, we're never truly going to be happy. But if we seek to do what's precious in God's sight, happiness is found. Our influence can be for good doing good works. You know, it's interesting as we talk about influence that even in First Peter chapter three, where the discussion is on husbands and wives, where the discussion goes on people that are one flesh together. Notice that he says you're in flow Once is not to be through the sexual relationship, you're not to seek to manipulate one another through that relationship. But rather, that relationship is a blessing for the other person. You're not to persuade someone to be a Christian through that relationship, or through the clothes that you were. But rather he says that you are to have a godly character, and live in submission and respect and honor honoring your husband. That is where true influence is to be found. Even in marriage. I find that telling if that's where a wife is to have her influence with her husband when they share an intimate relationship together. What does that mean for a woman before other people? What should her influence be? Should it be with her body? Or should it be with her character? Should it be with her clothes? Or should it be with her heart? I think the Scripture speaks clearly on this it should be with her heart. And here we see, our influence should be one of seeking to bring glory and honor and praise to God. Let me also notice a matter of purity, a matter of purity. Our clothes send a message and one of the messages that it sends is related to sexuality and marriage. Clothing can relay the character of chasteness shamefaced sadness, reverence and respect. Or it can relay the message of Proverbs seven and verse 10. When it talks about a woman dressed like a prostitute and cunning of hearts, her clothes convey her intention, as she uncovers herself. She is advertising her goal. They reveal her heart, she sought to entice to incite to manipulate, you know, for the world, I see their view of marriage and modesty is going hand in hand. The world says that marriage is outdated, it's not needed anymore. That exclusive relationship between one man and one woman, that's not the way to go. And people would laugh at you. If you were to say that you were waiting for marriage, you need to live free sexually, they would say there's to be no boundaries. You don't have to honor any kind of commitment there. In fact, the more exploits that you have, the better the world says. Is it any wonder that that attitude towards marriage is related to their attitude toward dress, wear what you want, you don't have to reserve your body for anybody. You be who you are, and you show your body, flaunt it, flaunt it.

Jeremy Sweets  37:53
It's interesting that the Bible talks about a reserve when it comes to marriage for the sexual relationship. It talks about this in many passages in Genesis 224 and 25. It says that they are to become one flesh, and they were naked and unashamed in the garden. In first Corinthians chapter seven, Paul says that the husband has authority over the wife of the body, the body of the wife, and vice versa. So they have authority, so to speak over each other's bodies, their bodies are for one another in marriage. And that's a beautiful thing. That's a gift from God, that they can share the intimacy that is seen there. We also see in First Corinthians chapter six verses 18 through 20. flees sexual immorality. Every sin person commits is outside the body every other sin, but the sexually immoral person sins against his own body. Are you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit within you whom you have from God, you are not your own, and you are bought with a price. So glorify God in your body. The Bible tells us repeatedly and talks about the fact men and women are not to lust after someone other than their spouse. And I would even not say that we're to lust after our spouse, because lust there is a selfish interest and marriage is a giving relationship. But the text there particularly Matthew five, do not lust after those that are not your spouse. But it also has reference I believe, to displaying our bodies before other people in marriage, the sexual love and the displaying of the body can go hand in hand in a good and pure way outside of marriage, it is not to be the case. The sexual relationship is not to happen outside of marriage and your body is not to be displayed or shown in that type of way outside of marriage. There is an issue of lust. In Matthew five verses 27 through 28 says You have heard that it was said you shall not commit adultery. But I say to you that everyone who looks at a woman with lust for intent has already committed adultery with her in his heart. This instruction was given to men because generally speaking, men are very visually stimulated. But it would apply, as I've mentioned before, to both men and women do not look with lust upon another, you would say if you committed the deed with someone else, that that would be adultery. Jesus says, Don't even entertain the thought in your heart, do not lust after another. And so we see that this instruction is extremely important today. As more and more people begin to shed the clothes as easy access to anything that needs or wants to be seen on online can be seen. Men and women have a responsibility to guard their own hearts. It is not going to be someone else that's going to cover themselves up in our day and time. That's not going to happen. We can promote that among our families and our children, but we have a responsibility to guard our hearts to turn our eyes because it is widely available all sorts of immodesty. So, last is an issue here for what is seen and looking upon. Let me say that marriage is the appropriate time and place for the sexual love as I've already mentioned, and outside of marriage, it is not in song a Psalm and chapter two and verse seven.

Jeremy Sweets  41:52
There the speaker says I a juror you owe daughters of Jerusalem by the gazelles are the dose of the field that you not stir up or awaken love until it pleases, there is an appropriate time for sexual love. And that's in the marriage relationship. But here in the Song of Solomon says, Do not awaken or stir up that love until the appropriate time until the time of marriage. And so we must be careful that we must not awaken or stir up that sexual love. Do not dress in a way that would incite or stir up lust in another person. Do not dress that way. Do not dance in a way that would incite or stir up lust in another person. Do not talk in a way Do not joke in a way that would incite or stir up lust in another person, do not act in a certain way in any way that would incite or stir up lust in another person. That is a special respectable element of a marriage relationship. But our country has lost the ability to have shame over that may mention one thing before I look at some some guidelines that I might offer. And that is there was one feminist that noticed that there was a double standard and how men and women were treated. And I tried to make the point that modesty is for both men and women. And so in part, I'm going to agree with this person. They say that men have had multiple sexual partners and they've been praised for that. Whereas a woman has been critiqued as being loose or whatever you want to say. This person said That's true and clothes as well. Men can wear whatever they want. And women have to cover up and this person was actually advocating that that women should be allowed to go freely topless anywhere. I agree that there has been a double standard, but we have vastly different solutions to the matter. Her solution is we should all be immoral. And we should all wear whatever we want. But I believe the solution is yes, men need to clean up their act as well. It's not appropriate to have these multiple, multiple sexual partners and where whatever you want. No men be men of purity and decency. That's what the Scripture calls us to. You see, I see some of the issues that she's talking about. We should recognize that but the answer is not more in morality. It's just not modesty matters, and it should matter to the Christian and involved in that as a matter of character, emphasis, influence and purity. Let me offer some general guidelines or questions to consider. The Bible does not provide a detailed dress code for us. It first of all appear pills to our heart and it causes us to Ask questions and think, you know, in some ways, it would be easier if it did give us a dress code because I could disengage my mind and simply follow the rules. Sometimes parents do that for their children don't say, and sometimes that's appropriate for younger children as they get older. But the first issue is the hardest shin. So let me ask these these questions for you to consider if you're thinking about clothing. Is the clothing too tight? Does it adhere to the shape and show off the shape of an individual too much? Is it too revealing and that could be simply not enough clothing? Low caught or too short? Whatever the case may be showing too much revealing too much. Is it to shear or see through you might have clothing on but it could be shear and see through and so it's as good as not having the clothing on? Is it to extravagance? Are you standing out? Are you seeking to be noticed because of what kind of clothes it is? Are you seeking attention? Are you seeking to elevate yourself? Because you have the right kind the clothes and this person doesn't? You're clearly better than them you think in your heart? Is that the way you're thinking and acting? Is the article of clothing worn in pride? modest clothing can be worn in modestly Kennett if the goal is to seek

pride. And if it comes from a prideful heart, is it Warren to seek attention? undue attention attention that again would elevate yourself? Or is it appropriate for the occasion? We haven't talked about this a lot. But it seems like the the instruction in First Timothy Chapter Two was, was in a church assembly where the focus was to be on God and serving God. Now it might be appropriate for that braided hair and gold for for a lady that's getting married. And so the focus is on her a celebration of that love, but it may not be appropriate in another context. And so context and the occasion does play into how we should consider things. And also the culture. Our culture is going one way saying take off everything. And there is a nature involved in the discussion so that we can't follow culture that way. But we also have to be aware of culture and other cultures, women are dressed and so that they would cover their faces and their hands. And I think it'd be inappropriate to go into that country and everyone else there, see you not dress like them and consider you immodest. They might be modest here in our culture. But if you were to go there, they would view you with disrespect, they would think that you are shaming your body. And so there has to be some consideration there of culture. Well, there's more things we consider and talk about. But that's the lesson this morning. Modesty matters. Let's show other people what is truly important. Let's direct people toward God and doing what is right. Let's not be so shallow. Let's not be so focused on external things. But let us seek to give God glory and praise and honor and all that we do. If you're here this morning and you're not a Christian, you have an opportunity to obey the gospel message, believing that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living God, repenting of your sins, being baptized into the water for the remission of your sins. If you're here this morning and you are a Christian and not living as you should make your life right this very moment. If any subject to the invitation, please come as we stand and sing at this time.
