First chapter first Peter. That's what we're spend our base our text tonight

Unknown Speaker  00:14
want to talk a bit tonight on the incredible outcomes of suffering. For theater one beginning in verse three must be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to his great mercy has caused us to be born again to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, to obtain an inheritance which is imperishable and undefiled and will not fade away, reserved in heaven for you who are protected by the power of God through faith for salvation ready to be revealed and the last time in this you greatly rejoice even though now for a little while, if necessary, you've been distressed by various trials, so that the proof of your faith being more precious than gold which is perishable, even though tested by fire, may be found to result in praise and glory and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ. And though you have not seen me love him, and then you do not see him now, but believing him you greatly rejoice with joy inexpressible and full of glory. Attaining is the outcome of your faith, the salvation of your souls. God's role in our suffering, is one of the great perplexities of the Bible Job and his friends, throughout the book, wrestle with this question. After being afflicted beyond measure, Joe was told by all his friends, that he's being afflicted, because of the sin. It's difficult to understand exactly how God allow Satan to, to destroy all the job has and test him and yet we see in different ways, or in different places throughout job. He remains steadfast from chapter two, verse three, God saying to Satan, regarding job and he still holds fasces integrity, although you incited me against him, to ruin him without cause. And then at the end of the chapter with his friends and family that had known him before coming to console and comfort him, for all the adversities the Lord brought on him. And then his letter days were blessed more than the first, we see another well known example of suffering in the New Testament with Paul, and his thorn in the flesh, which was again part of God's will. You got it allowed a messenger of Satan to be sent to Paul, despite Paul's earnest attempts in prayer to have it removed. And we see from the context that this was helpful to Paul and keeping him from being conceited because of the surpassing greatness, of the revelations that he'd mentioned. And so again, God's will that one should suffer ultimately, for their own good with, to some extent, Satan being the the instrument of the tool used. And then, and first, Peter, throughout the whole book, it makes it clear that it's God's will for us to suffer in various ways and for different trials, from verse six, and the patches that we just read, if necessary, you've been distressed by various trials. And so that it begs the question, why it wasn't necessary. What does this actually for? And who is the one that's extending it necessary? And it's these are tough questions to answer. And from chapter three and verse 17, similar phrasing, Brutus better if God's Will so that you suffer for what he's doing right, rather than for what he's doing wrong. And again, in chapter four and verse 19, therefore those also who suffer according to the will of God, shall entrust their souls to a faithful Creator, and doing what is right. Does God will that we lose our job or that we lose a loved one or a close relationship, or lose someone to death? Does he will that other tragic events occur on the earth that are outside of our control with war torn countries or rampid disease and impoverished places or lack of food? Those aren't questions that we're gonna be able to answer tonight. But if we learned anything from from job, it is to be incredibly careful how we view God's hand in all of this and what the ultimate reason and purposes behind all the and what we can learn from first Peters that we are not only to know that we should be aware of suffering, but we should expect it. And there are a few different things we'll look at tonight that are ultimately great triumphs and outcomes of the suffering. First Peter four, verse 12. Beloved, do not be surprised at the fiery ordeal among you, which comes upon you for your testing as though some strange thing were happening to you. So again, this is not something that should shock us, but rather something that we should expect, and not just on occasion, something that we should see time and time again. We aren't providentially sheltered from all wrongs, or hurt when we come across Question. But rather, we should expect just the opposite, we should expect to be forced to these trials. And First Peter or the letter this Peters writing here is pointing ultimately to Christ as the primary example of what it means to suffer

Unknown Speaker  05:16
for righteousness. And so in chapter two, he looks at the example of another unjust suffering chapter to get to verse 20. For what credit is there if when you sin and are harshly treated, you endure it with patience. But if you do what is right and suffer for it, you patiently endure this, this finds favor with God. For you have been called for this purpose, since Christ also suffered for you, leaving you an example, for you to fall in his steps, who committed no sin, nor was any deceit found in his mouth. And similar ideas seen just a bit further in chapter three, verse nine, not returning evil for evil or insult for insult, but giving a blessing instead, for you are called for the very purpose that you might inherit a blessing. And so ultimately, God is calling us to live in the exact nature of his son, when he was able to turn away from payback or from wanting to solve or fix all the heartaches, and hopefully wrongs by others that he received in this life, but rather to be meekly and trusting our souls to the one who judges righteously. And he even encouraged him to chapter three, from verse 13. He says he was there even harm you for falling with or what is good. And yet still, we know from the verse falling, we will experience those trials. So we know what our response would be, we know that we would expect it time and again, we know that there is some design behind all of it from God. And so we'll look at why, through a few different points, why these things are ultimately so beneficial for us. So back to verse six, and this you greatly rejoice even though now for a little while, if necessary, you've been distressed by various trials, the trials that we face are not going to be the same time and time again. There was an experiment done in Arizona called biosphere two. And in it, scientists tried to recreate the ecosystem that is Earth in a more concentrated environment to see if they could engage in space exploration and replicate environments elsewhere. And so they had recreated just about everything that we have here on earth deserts, rainforest, even an ocean within this this biosphere. But the one thing that they couldn't replicate, was wind. And over time, the effects became evident some of the acacia trees that were inside the biosphere, though they had grown tall, and without much trouble early on, were unable to sustain they bent over, some of them even snapped. They weren't able to produce the reactionary wood or the strengthening wood that allows them to maintain their their nature, as we see them every day. And so, despite simulating heat and cold and nearly everything else, within this small ecosystem, without the one element of wind, ultimately prove fatal to part of their plan. And so there are a variety ways for us as well in which we are tested, that are all part of God's design for us. And despite the fact that we may think it'd be nicer or better. If we weren't exposed to some of these things, we know that all of them play a role in our ultimate strengthening as Christians. And first, in first Peter there are several different depictions of struggles for men. On Earth, he talks about subjects being tested by kings by authority, slaves by their masters both conned and unkind. Wives by unbelieving husbands being falsely accused in the faith and having to give a defense for it. Suffering scorn and ridicule from former friends after changing a way of life and so weird experience a vast array of different trials all by design so that our faith may be purified. We also know that our trials are going to be Rivas. Another example happens to be another plant example the size of plant grows in, in Yucatan, Mexico. And it's very strong. It's very, very hard, tough soil that grows

Unknown Speaker  09:38
in and extreme heat and wind, but it produces a very profitable fiber used for Toine. And so some Americans had seen that and thought we may be able to replicate this and more suitable conditions so they took this up to Florida to try and replicate this planet a at a higher rate. The trees grew once or the plants again grew large, much larger than before. business profit or promise great returns until the day of harvest came. And when it came time to take the vibe or the fiber from those leaves that were vital to the creation of that, that twine, the leafs collapsed into a soft pulp, because they weren't forged in the same environment they were used to before they learned that, that what made them so strong was the adverse conditions that that they had originally observed them in. And so the plant lost its toughness, because it didn't have to struggle to grow. And it was ultimately useless for the very purpose it had been set to grown for. And so as soon as well, I got done running the race in end of March. And I trained a little bit better for this one. But lack of training, as I think I may get from my father, he can share some some details he yesterday showed up right around mile 20. I'd gone through and already felt much better about this race. And then I hit it, I hit the wall, and I knew it was gonna hit and push through my training I'd made I think 120 off running run on a weekend I thought, well, this is better, I usually get to like 16 or 17. And then sure enough in the race, I thought Why did I do this, you know, we got six more miserable miles. And it's, you know, just me that I have the blame. So the same example we have to be willing to endure that, no matter what because we know it produces a better version of ourselves. And that's all part I believe, of God's plan for the for the various trials that that we see in the slide, and again reminds us of the thorn and Paul's flesh. He had reason to glory because of the surpassing greatness of the revelation that presumably he'd seen. But he was held back ultimately for his own good by that thorn in the flesh to keep him from exalting and to keep him humble, he had prayed intensely, that it'd be removed from him. But what was God's response? He said, My grace is sufficient for you, for my power is made perfect in weakness, the thorns will hurt, but they're there for a reason. Another example is given of a, an emperor moth that a man observes, coming out of its cocoon was struggling to get out of the cocoon, and the man thought I'll help it out. So he took a pair of scissors and cut off in the end of the cocoon. And sure enough, the moth emerged with ease that emerged with a swollen body, and shriveled wings, it can never fly. And so the struggle that comes from exiting that cocoon, and the way that God designed to the man had robbed him, that that moth of the of the health and strength that it needed to ultimately do the job that it was designed to carry out by depriving them off the struggle, he deprived them off of health. It's awesome, also a little bit helpful, keeping that in mind, and preparing for tonight, because I thought, Man, this is tough preparing for this lesson. But I think this gonna come back to me another time. You know, we got three guys here that do this pretty regularly. But I am thankful for the opportunity. Paul needed that same kind of a thorn, we need the pain of the trials, if it were mildly unpleasant, it would never produce the desired effects that we want in our lives. And ultimately, we know that God's in control, and they won't let us be tested beyond what we can bear. We know that relief will come at the right moment. So we see the web a variety of trials and that there also be grievous. But beyond this, we'll also see that the trials are brief. Again in from verse six, it's the phrases though now for a little while. And so there's a couple of perspectives that we can take on the idea of them being brief. Certainly, in terms of even our own lives here, no trial is, is completely continuous. There are times of respite times when we're distracted from the pain times where we do experience, comfort from some of God's other blessings that He bestows upon us. And as we just saying, read again, the first verse, from day by day. Day by day, and with each passing moment, strength I find to meet my trials here. Trusting in my Father's wise bestowment,

Unknown Speaker  14:33
I've no cause for worry or fear. He whose heart is calm beyond all measure, Gives them to each day what He deems best. And so does God mixing in that toil and pleasure and giving us the right balance of what we can sustain that allows us to grow. And again referencing First Corinthians chapter 10, verse 13, No temptation has overtaken you except such as it is as common to man, but God is faithful, who will not allow you to be tempted beyond what you were able. So he knows your limits. He knows my limits. Yes, it will be painful. But it also be brief and relief will come exactly when it is needed. It certainly also brief from from God's perspective. And the the man who had outlined this lesson was talking about a time where he'd experienced a tremendous earache, pain that he couldn't even adequately describe or, or do portray. And he kept thinking to himself when he was just clutching the heat pad next was you're looking for some relief, it'll be over soon, it'll be over soon, surely the pressure will be too great. And something I'll give. And eventually, of course, he was right, the pressure, give way. But isn't that how we have to view the trials of this life in the moment, they are intense, they are unpleasant, but we know they are so brief, in the grand scheme of things. As well, there was an example of a child that had to go for a checkup with a peanut allergy. And this is not something I'm well versed in. But I'm sure some of you know what those what those checkups are like, where they actually have to test what the allergic reaction is to those allergies, and actually bring it into contact with skin, the oils. And so for the girl on this example that I that I listened to, there's no way to adequately explain why these things have to take place. So you can just look to her parents and and know that they're there to hold her hand and comfort her for those uncomfortable 15 minutes. And there's no, there's no true reasoning that can be understood in that moment. But ultimately, it's there for for better health, and an accurate assessment of the situation. And that's what we see throughout first peer that we're pilgrims here that this is not our home, that we're just passing through, but we can see our home, just beyond Jordan with no more pain, and ultimately rest, and God. And so trials are grievous. And they're gonna come to us in various ways. And they will be short, and ultimately they lead to a purified faith. Again, from chapter one in this, you greatly rejoice even though now for a little while, if necessary, you have been distressed by various trials so that the proof of your faith being more precious than gold, which is perishable, even though tested by fire, maybe found a result in praise and glory and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ. And so of course, the the well known example, analogy of gold, when it comes out of the ground is not clean, there's a lot of other alloys and dirt that have to be removed from it. And it's passed through that fire and intensity, so that the gold, the true gold will sink to the bottom and everything else can be removed from the top, the dross. And that's in a very real way what God sees in us, when we decide to come from the world to him, he sees the pure gold that's in there, but it's mixed in with a lot of other things that have to be removed. And so through these, through these trials, we can remove those distractions, whether it's our job, or our money that we trust in, you know, we were worried about not being able to make the next payment that's coming up, we have to go into debt to figure something out. And then all of a sudden, God provides a way of escape provides a new job provides a race, provide support in some other way. Or maybe we hang on too much to our position, or influence, or ultimately, ourselves, too much arrogance and self reliance. And these are all part of the refining process of getting rid of these things so that when we pass through, we'll have a pure undefiled faith in God. Turn to the Second Corinthians one. We'll see an example of the Second Corinthians one, verse eight.

Unknown Speaker  19:24
Fully not want you to be unaware brethren, of our affliction, which came to us in Asia, that we were burned excessively beyond our strength, so that we despaired even of life. There's the fire. Indeed, we had the sentence of death within ourselves so that we would not trust in ourselves but in God who raises the dead. And there's the gold. So Paul went through trials we can only imagine here being a small example of one through stonings, and beatings and being homeless shipwrecks going hungry, despair and even of life itself. And you At he knew, as well as we can know that it was all for the greater purpose of a stronger faith and impure undefiled trust in God. And in addition to the trolls coming at us in various ways, being painful, being brief, and leading to a stronger faith here on Earth, ultimately, they result in praise and honor and glory, both here, but also to come back to First Peter. From chapter four, he mentions, if you were evolved for the name of Christ, you are blessed because the spirit of glory of God rests on you. So when we go through our our darkest trials, being blessing for the name of Christ, we can know that that is when we are at some of our most of your time with God similar to Steven, when he was about to be killed, and he saw Jesus standing at the right hand of God, like Steven, in that moment, we can know that in those moments, we are close to God, we are experiencing the same things that ultimately we were called to experience, like we had looked at them earlier and chapter two, and in chapter three. But ultimately, the greater glory is not until until later in verse 12, and 13. We won't always know the reason for the testing here, we know that it's worth it, and impulse speaks on this. And various examples throughout the New Testament, we'll read a few for sake of time, that talks about the ultimate glory to come that can't even be compared with the weight of suffering here from Romans eight, verse 18, For I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worth comparing with the glory that is to be revealed to us. For the creation waits with eager longing for the revealing of the sons of God. In second Corinthians chapter four, verse 16, so we do not lose heart, though our outer self is wasting away, our inner self is being renewed day by day. For this light, momentary affliction is preparing for us an eternal weight of glory, beyond all comparison, as we look not to the things that are seen, but to the things that are unseen, for the things that are seen are transient, but the things that are unseen, are eternal. And again, in Second Timothy, chapter four, beginning of verse six, for I'm already being poured out as a drink offering, and the time of my departure has come, I have fought the good fight, I finished the race, I've kept the faith. Henceforth, there's laid up for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge will award to me on that day, and not only to me, but also to all who have loves his appearing. And that is ultimately what we focus on. We fix our eyes on the finish line, while we're burdened here with all the sin that's presently around us vying for our attention. When we're surrounded, or or weighed down by the sins of our past, that hold us back, that prevent us from forgetting what lies behind us so that we can reach forward to what's ahead. When we're attacked by those around us, for just the fact that we're running the race. We don't look for lasting comfort, or peace here, although God gives us some, but no, we fixate on the end. And we think how we can reflect the glory of Christ and bring glory to Him, as well as God assures us that He will be with us here and with us to the end, and ultimately receiving the crown of glory that we will cast before him.

Unknown Speaker  24:01
Turn with me to Revelation chapter seven. Revelation seven, beginning in verse nine, this will be one of our last passages this evening. Verse nine After these things I looked, and behold a great multitude which no one could count, from every nation in all tribes and peoples and tongues standing before the throne, and before the Lamb clothed in white robes, and palm branches were in their hands. And they cry out with a loud voice saying Salvation to our, to our God who sits on the throne and to the Lamb. And all the angels were standing around the throne and around the elders and the four living creatures and they fell on their faces before the throne and worship God, saying, Amen, blessing and glory and wisdom and thanksgiving and honor and power and might be to our God forever and ever, amen. Then one of the elders answered, saying to me, these who are clothed in white robes, who are they, and wherever they come from, I said to him, My Lord, you know, and he said to me, these are the ones who come out of the Great Tribulation, and they have washed their robes and made them white in the blood of the land. For this reason, they are before the throne of God and they serve and day and night in his temple. And he sits on the throne was spread His tabernacle over them, they will hunger no longer, nor thirst anymore, nor will the sun beat down on them, nor any heat. For the lamb in the center of the throne will be their shepherd, and will guide them to springs to the water of life. And God will wipe away every tear from their eyes. That is something that we should all look forward to. When we get the reward for all the suffering in this life, that is the true end goal, in addition to the betterment of our faith, hear the encouragement that we can be to one another. Ultimately, our answer for all this suffering, the questions that we pose in the beginning, will be found when we can be with him one day. But there is a another point to suffering as well.

Unknown Speaker  26:27
X 17x 17 Verse 26. Any made from one man, every nation of mankind live on the on all the face of the earth, having determined their appointed times and the boundaries of their habitation that they would seek God if perhaps they might grow up for Him and find Him, though He is not far off from each one of us. This reminds me of several of the thoughts that we've been seeing in Ecclesiastes really recently and ultimately how man through various means is just searching for meaning here. They're they're grasping at everything to try and find something that is worth living for. That is, that is true. That is right. And so maybe that's why you're here tonight. If it's suffering that's brought you here because you can't find comfort in the things of this world. If you're searching from deep within to find truth, strength and wisdom and answers. You're coming to the right person seeking out God is that that ultimate answer? And so if we can help you and assisting your search of the solution, all these answers please come forward as as we stand and sing
