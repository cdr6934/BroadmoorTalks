Good evening. It's good to see everyone here tonight. I was away preaching at Brentwood this morning. So it's good to be back with you here. Tonight. The elders asked me to abbreviate my sermon. And as far as I know, that's not allowed to be a permanent request. Y'all can't ask the elders to keep doing that to me. Which is fine. They're gonna have some comments. I'm looking forward to that. But it did. It did make me change what I was doing. So this is one of those sermons where I'll say at the beginning, we'll see how this goes. I'm not exactly sure. So the first time I changed, I started developing a second sermon. And it got too long. So this is my third try. So that's what we're doing. And in fact, I'm going to finish up a sermon that I've already preached. So maybe that's what we're going to do here. tonight. I want to ask a question. And that question is, When did Zacchaeus repent? When did Zacchaeus repent? Now I preached the lesson not too long ago, about big things from my little main, big things from a little man. And we looked at the fact that Zacchaeus was a big senator, as indicated in verse two there, it says that he was a tax collector. And not only that he was a chief tax collector. Apparently, he had reached a high position in a position that normally would take advantage of others and was often known for taking advantage of other people overcharging others. He was recognized in the community as a sinner. And we saw that he was a big sinner, but he also had a big heart. Despite his small stature, he wanted to see Jesus, and he climbed up in a tree, and he did everything that he could, in order to see the Savior. He had big potential. And the Savior saw this as he says, IKEA, so I'm coming to your house today, despite what other people thought about him that he was a sinner unworthy of the Lord's attention. That's not how Jesus Christ saw it. And then Then verse eight, which is really where we're going to talk a little bit more about our questions night, there was big repentance, big repentance, we see that he, he vows to give of his possessions to the poor, and if he is defrauded anyone that he will repay for fold. And Jesus mentioned that there would be big salvation in his house, there are a couple of people that asked me about a translation that we see in verse eight. So you can look here, and I'll be looking at the New American Standard, says, IKEA stopped and said the Lord, behold, Lord, half of my possessions I will give to the poor. And if I have defrauded anyone of anything, I will give back four times as much. The NIV even takes it a step further and adds the language here. And now I give. And so as we read this translation from the New American Standard, new revised, we see that Zacchaeus is committing, committing himself to making this change. He says, I will make this change and almost used as the future tense here that I will give to the poor. And if I have the fraud, I will give back. The ESV and New King James King James reads a little bit differently. And Zacchaeus, stood and said, The Lord, behold, Lord, the half of my goods I give to the poor. And if I've defrauded anyone of anything, I restore it fourfold. And so there's just a shifting of the tents there. In the second one, instead of saying, I will do this, there is almost an indication of I am doing this. And so I just want to ask the question tonight, when did Zacchaeus repent? Sometimes in a text, I will give you the product of my study. And so I'll study attacks, I don't go through all the ins and outs of everything, I'll try to give you my conclusions and try to preach. This is what the text says, so that it's gonna be a little bit more different and that I want to take you through the process of what I'm doing and how I reached this conclusion. In fact, I'm not even sure I have a conclusion, but I want you to see the process of of how we look at this text and study and ask this question. Okay, fair enough. And we're going to do that in 20 minutes. I'm really not resentful. It sounds like I'm resentful. I'm not it's fine. So if we look at this present, repentance, meaning that that I he Zacchaeus is committing at that moment, I will do change,

Jeremy Sweets  05:01
then the language would be I will give, I don't know why I have give there twice. I think I meant to have a slight slash and then I will repay. But under this way we see that Zacchaeus was a sinner, and he was a sinner that was looking for Jesus, Jesus, the Savior. He was one that was lost and looking for the Savior to come and speak to Him. The Pharisees around him will be asking the question, can a tax collector become a disciple? Can a tax collector become a disciple? Now they seem to have already answered that question is no, he cannot, he is a sinner unworthy of Jesus turn. So the Jews were discounting others from becoming disciples. Well, there is a slight change, but it really has a big impact on the text if we shift the tense there. And it's almost the sense of instead of I will give of my possessions he is saying, I am giving or I presently give meaning, I have already repented, and I am doing this, in that case is IKEA's is a disciple of Jesus is the master, he was excited to see the master and talk to him. And so the question among the Jews would be, can a tax collector be a disciple? Can one be a disciple and still hold that job? What is necessary, in that the Jews discounted those who were already disciples? And so may seem like a fine point, but I think it has a big impact really on how we look at this text. So as I begin to ask this question, I asked a series of questions about the text and to the text. And really, what I'm doing is I'm starting with the word and I began to expand out from the text from that that word, looking for clues or indications about what's happening. So I start with the word and look at a definition of the word. And we'll look at that there in a second are really the tents of what's there. After we look at. Wow, I start with a question, what does the text mean, we look at the definition, then I began to expand out what's what's in that story, that may give me an indication of the meaning of this. And then I'll even expand out a little bit further looking at stories that are around it, or the themes that are there. And then I'll extend out further and make sure that this is something that's consistent with the truth we find elsewhere in Scripture. And so as I look at this text, the first thing I do is put a question to the text. And so many of you did that to me after I preached, you said bigger penance. But when I read in my version, it says I am giving or I give. And so there was a question there. As we read through the text, that may be something you hear different from the translation, it may be simply a thought that you have but one of the best ways to be a good student is to ask lots of questions. And you may talk and ask those to other people, but it may just be you're asking yourself, what does the text mean, in this case? What is meant by this? How does this work? And so the more questions you ask, and then you dig in yourself and begin to try to find those, this question is when did Zacchaeus repentant what what is that word there? What's involved there? So as we'll look at the definition, or really the tense we're focusing on that word give is a present active indicative, okay?

Jeremy Sweets  08:43
If you're used to grammar, you may be familiar with those terms. But present, I think we get what a present tense is that's opposed to the past, something that happened in the past or the future. Now the traditional way, the idea what I understood to be the traditional, the idea that Zacchaeus is committing, saying I will that's more of a future, isn't it? So maybe the natural reading here is a present I give to the poor, I restore, I restore active as, instead of being passive, the being acted upon the subject, he is the one that is acting. And indicative is simply a statement of fact, it's a little bit different than maybe like a subjunctive. A subjunctive says I wish I were so that's not saying this is the case, saying I wish so that's kind of a subjunctive okay. This is an indicative of present active indicative, I give, I give the often in Greek the tenses are a little bit different, but and present is sometimes difficult to evaluate exactly what it means. It may have a sense of a continuing action, I guess. Give meaning I am giving and continue to give that can be embedded within that that word. So as we look at that word, we begin to ask the question again, which one of these is involved? What does it mean? Okay, well, we're going to extend beyond that, noticing that it was a present tense verb, is there anything in the story itself that would give us an indication or a clue? There may be more than this, I want to notice Jesus response in verses nine and 10. Jesus said to him, today, salvation has come to this house, since he also is the son of Abraham, for the Son of Man came to seek and to save the last. And so does this help us answer the question about Jesus? Is he? Or about Zacchaeus? Is he one that has already repented? Or is he committing his repentance right here? What does this add to the discussion? Well, he does say today, that may indicate my saying, Today salvation has come, that may indicate that he's presently repenting is not something that has happened in the past, he is bringing salvation here. Or you really could, could really explain that in a more general sense as Jesus comes to him. This today may be more vague than that and not have that specific timeframe. You also begin to ask questions like as you extend even beyond this, do we have other occasions where a disciple comes to Jesus in this manner? Or is this more of a conversion story? And so then we begin to look at other stories, what is found, in other cases, what is found in the book of Luke? Okay, so I know I have a lot of opening questions tonight. But I'm just trying to get us to think through the process. So I began to extend out to the story and see is there anything in the story of Jesus and Zacchaeus,

Jeremy Sweets  12:08
then it'll begin to extend out to the themes really, of Luke. And in this section, I did this a little bit when I preached on on this subject. And so we see many different themes and chapter 18, where you see a section where themes of wealth and poverty, of discipleship, and also the Pharisees, the supposed religious people of the day, alongside disciples, those are placed side by side, and that tension between those that believe they are disciples, and those that are truly disciples, is found all throughout here in chapter 18, verses nine through 14, and talks about the Pharisee and the tax collector. In verse nine, it says, He told this parable to some who trusted in themselves that they were righteous, and treated others with contempt, we see a question of discipleship as we go on further with the rich young ruler. And if you remember, or if you don't, I put those side by side and said that the rich young ruler was unable to part with his wealth, whereas IKEA's freely gave as wealth. And the question was asked, after the rich young ruler, if this is the case, then who can be saved? And I believe that that Zacchaeus answers that question here is one that can be saved as he humbles himself and gives of his means. And we also see these themes, again, of the established religious people there along with those that were outsiders, and how do they accept one another? So does that have any bearing on our question? Do those themes help us answer that question? Well, as I mentioned in 18, and verse nine, that could go either way is they looked with contempt upon others. I think that theme continues on into the story of Zacchaeus. And so the question is, are both of these biblical positions? I believe that they are, as you look at one you could really make a case for one and for the other and both would be biblical, meaning that it wouldn't violate other teachings of Scripture. If that were the case, our our journey or question would be pretty readily answered, wouldn't it? But here we're looking at something that can sit consistent with truth. Okay. I don't know if that was helpful or not. What I tried to do is look at the meaning there of that word and extend me extend out. And so I began by looking at the sentence, looked at the section, looked at the themes that are around it, and then extended that out, even into the other parts of scripture. So when did Zacchaeus repent? That's gonna be my question for you. I don't have an answer. I simply gave one position without even explaining this whole process before that that Zacchaeus was committing to repentance right then. And that's probably where I would lean. But it's a difficult question. It's a difficult question. I do have one other question. And that is, do you need to repent tonight Zacchaeus humbled Himself and repented before the Lord. And acts 17 verses 30. And 31 says the times of ignorance God overlooked, but now he commands all people everywhere to repent, because he has fixed the day on which he will judge the world and righteousness by a man whom he has appointed. and of this he has given assurance to all by raising Him from the dead. Notice a few simple points from this passage. God wants everyone, all people to repent, to turn away from sin, and to turn to Him. The reason we need to do that is because there is a day of judgment that awaits us, we will be held account for what we have done. We see also that he has given us an assurance of that judgment to come and also one that will act as our Savior, the one that was raised from the dead, and that is Jesus Christ. And so we can repent based upon what God has done and the promise that He has made that he will offer forgiveness to us. Is there anyone here tonight that needs to repent? If you're not a Christian, you can become a Christian tonight by by believing that Jesus is the Christ repenting of your sins, confessing that Jesus is the Christ and being baptized in the water for the remission of your sins. If you're here tonight, and you are a Christian, and you're not living as you should, you're not honoring your commitment. You may also need to repent. If there's anyone subject to the invitation. Please come as we stand and sing at this time.
