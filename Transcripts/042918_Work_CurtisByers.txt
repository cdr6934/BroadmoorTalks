If you will open your Bibles to Genesis, the second chapter of Genesis Chapter Two was the nice in the auditorium class we are studying the class at Conrad is teaching on what the Bible says about the Christian and how he used to use his possessions. I appreciate Conrad, I take on this subject. So vital subject is a needed subject. And this coming Wednesday night, we're going to be looking particularly at what the Apostle Paul has to say about that. And Paul had a lot to say about it. So much so that we really couldn't do justice to all of Paul's teachings on just one class. So I thought this morning, we would talk about one of the topics that Paul's raises, and that is his teaching concerning work. It is work, by the way that most of us get our possessions. And so I think it is a relevant topic to that study. And I hope it'll be useful for us this morning, it's good to see each and every one of you here, and never gets old to come together with you to worship God to encourage one another to remind and remind ourselves of all the great things God has done for us. So thank you so much for joining us this morning. We generally define work as that activity by which we earn money money. That's really to Darrow narrow of a definition for our purposes, the dictionary says that work is any sustained physical or mental exertion for a compulsory or needed purpose. By that definition, I was think that most of our life is consumed by work. Whether whether we go into a place of business, whether we're cutting the grass, or shopping for groceries, or cooking those groceries, cleaning or repairing something, or washing clothes, or purchasing clothes, or making clothes or going to the doctor or taking somebody to the doctor, and so forth, and so on. All those activities are work, they are necessary. We are compelled to do those sorts of things. If we want to live in this world, they are work. So most of us unless we were born with a silver spoon in our mouth, spend most of our life in work. We have relatively small amounts of time that are not work. Perhaps as we get older, that non work time increases, but even then we are still things that we must do if we want to live in this world. So given the prevalence of work in our lives, it's not surprising. I think that the Bible is not silent about our work. And the first mention of man's work is there in Genesis chapter two. So if you've got Genesis two, you might look with me. look first at Verse five, where the text says, when no bush of the field was getting the land and no small planet, the field had yet sprung up. For the LORD God had not caused it to rain on land, and there was no man to work the ground. It was interesting that for bushes and small plants to prosper, there were there are two things that were required. First, there must be rain sent from God and there must be the work of man. If you're going down verses 15 and 17. The text says, The Lord God took the man and put him in the garden of Eden to work it and keep it. And the Lord commanded the man saying you shall you may surely eat of every tree of the garden by the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil, you shall not eat. For in that day you shall eat of it. That day that you eat of it, you shall surely die on their application. I think it's clear that from the beginning, it was God's intent. That work would be the means by which one sustained oneself. God provided the earth. God provided the rain. He provided the garden, it was expected that man would provide the work. We are created to be workers. But to go back early in this text, go back up verses one and two, they're in Genesis two. We're also told that God's creative activity is also called work. The verse one it says Thus the heavens and the earth were things and all the host event of them. Another seventh day God finished his work that he had done and he rested on the seventh day from all the work that he had done.

Curtis Byers  04:39
The scriptures are literally full of God's work. We are regularly called upon in Scripture to look about the look of the heavens to look at the creations to see all the works of God. He cares for us, He protects us. He provides us He sustains us. He works against Satan in works for us. From this I believe we are to understand that God's activity of God's work is intended to be a model for our work. This text also mentions that God rested on the seventh day. Guys rest also becomes a model for the children of Israel. When God delivered them from Egypt, with His mighty hand and brought them to Mount Sinai, he gave them his law. And the fourth commandment or the 10 commandments, reads in Exodus chapter 20, and verse eight, Texas Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy. Six days you shall labor and do all your work, but on the seventh day, but the seventh day is a sabbath to the Lord your God. You shall do not do any work your your son or your daughter, your male servant, or your female servant, or your livestock, or the sojourner who has everything your days for six days, the LORD made heaven and earth, the sea and all that is in them and rested on the seventh day. Therefore, the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and made it holy. We will read this text, we focus as the text does as well, upon that seventh day upon that day that God rested from his labors. But we may miss the starting point, the fundamental point that he makes at the beginning, the Lord says six days, you shall labor work. Labor is the norm. It's the standards is what we do most. Rest is only a small part of what we are to do. Work is the thing that we are to do the most. That said, the Bible is not silent about work. God's work in particular is held before us. Bible really doesn't say that much explicitly about man's work. It's just always kind of part of the background. It's assumed that man is working. All the major Bible characters that we know of, were workers. And we read of them, they were shepherds. They were artisans. They were tentmakers. Or they were carpenters. They had work to do and they did their work. But the Apostle Paul does have a few things to say about working his letters, and SAS, his letters were addressed to Christians concerning topics that were as relevant to them. We can assume that therefore, whenever he talks about work, he felt like work was something that he needed to address with them. So what I like to do this morning is to look at four passages of scripture in Paul's writings, and just let them speak for themselves. Let's just see what Paul has to say about work. Both in both First and Second Thessalonians. Two of Paul's earliest letter, Paul stresses the need for Christians to work and the consequences for them refusing the work. This instruction is given in the context, we're not gonna have time look at that. It's good in the context where Paul's also teaching them about the second coming to Jesus. And some were thinking that coming to Jesus, we're going to be sold soon, perhaps that they didn't feel the need to work at least as a conclusion that we might can draw from what said, Doesn't say that explicitly. But in any case, Paul does have something to say about work. It first Thessalonians the fourth chapter. Let's begin reading the verse nine.

Curtis Byers  08:30
Concerning brotherly love, you have no need for anyone to write to you, for yourselves have been taught to love and by God to love one another. For that, indeed, is what you're doing to all the brothers throughout Macedonia. But we urge you, brothers to do this more and more, and to aspire to live quietly, and to mind your own affairs, and to work with your hands as we instruct you. So that you may walk properly, before outsiders and be dependent upon no one. Paul gives a forest structions in this passage, they were to love their brother and they were to aspire to live quietly. They were to mind their own affairs, and they were to work with their hands. Now I believe that all four of those are not independent obstructions that is, I believe it'd be difficult to do any one of those four, without also doing the other three. For example, if we don't work, how long will it be before we are How Long Will Will we be able to mind our own affairs? Probably not very long or if we if we entangle ourselves in the affairs of another will we be will we be very successful at having a quiet life? Probably not. Because the last of those four instructions instructions in particular that we want to look at where it says poor Paul says for us to work with our own hands. Notice also right after that, he says as, as we instructed you. Paul had only been to XSL Anika once we believe before he wrote this letter. And so not only is Paul writing them in this letter to work, he had already told that them when he was with them previously, Paul wasn't with them for very long if the if the record and x is complete, he wasn't with them for a very long time. They're in Thessalonica. And it's interesting that among the topics that he taught them, was a necessity to work with your hands. We use that expression as an idiom to refer to any type of work that we do. Whether we were working physically with our hands, or whether we are working with our minds, we talk about working with our hands. I think Paul was actually talking about it, they use that in a very literal sense and talking about manual labor. Roman citizens, especially those in upper class, thought manual labor was beneath him. They had a disdain for it. They refused to do it, they have service for that type of work. But I believe that with this one instruction, that Paul forever makes an end to that kind of mindset. Manual labor is not something to be avoided, nor disparaged, rather, is something to embrace. Now, why are Paul Why does Paul give these commands these instructions, there are two purposes that he mentions. The first one is that they may walk properly, before outsiders, being good citizens, good neighbors, good employees are all important in God's kingdom. Paul said this made this point in other letters as well, over in clashes, the fourth chapter of verse five, Paul told those brethren, to walk in wisdom toward outsiders. And when he was telling Timothy, the qualifications of an elder, when he says he told him, they're First Timothy, the third chapter, moreover, He that is, the elder must be well thought of, by outsiders, the same instruction was given to Titus and Titus three, where he says a day older and mush, Oh, perfect courtesy, toward all people. And in First Peter, the third chapter, Peter makes the same point to all Christians, where he says, Keep your conduct among the Gentiles honorable, and when they speak against you as evil doers, that they may see your good deeds and glorify the God, a glorified God and the day of visitation. We should never give any reason to anyone to say that we are living improperly. I think we underestimate at times the importance, the value of being good examples, even in our efforts to convert others to Christ. So evangelism can take many forms.

Curtis Byers  13:14
I think I reminded of what Peter told wives to do, who did not have believing husbands, you're probably familiar with the passage of the First Peter the third chapter, there are a total of them says, likewise, wives, be subject to your own husbands. So they even have some do not obey the word that they may with be one without a word, by the conduct of their lives, where they see your respectful and pure conduct. The instruction to the wives was to be a good wife to live a good life to be a good example. That in itself teaches a lesson. preaching the word must first start by living the word. If we think about this in the context of working, a good question to ask ourselves and to ponder is how do others that we work with view us? What are what is the words that come to mind to describe us? When they think about us? Do they see us as being good examples? When we go to our jobs each day, do people look upon us and say that they are setting the right type of example in working and living a life before others? Do we bring glory and honor to the name of our father? Or do they see us as a complainer as the one who gripes who doesn't want to work? Who wants to rather cause discontent? What type of example Do we live before others? Paul says that we ought to work with our hands, as well as do these other things inspiring Live quiet lives, so that we might be walked properly before outsiders is important how others see us. The second thing that Paul says in this passage of the second purpose for doing those four things, is that we might be dependent on no one. Now your translation may be different than that the phrase is somewhat ambiguous, I'm told. And it could be translated as it here is an English standard in the sense that we have no need of anyone. Or it could be translated the way it is, and the King James, and I think the New American Standard and a few others, where it says that we have no need of anything. translations are divided. But either way, the point is the same. I think our needs are to be sloth or Reaper supplied by our own work. We're not to be dependent upon the work of others and providing for ourselves. That understanding I think, is also reflected in Second Thessalonians was second letter that Paul wrote to the same brother, not much longer, or not much further down the road than he did wrote the first letter. They're in Second Thessalonians, a third chapter. In verse six. The text says, that we command you brothers and name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you that you keep away from any brother who's walking in idleness, and not in accord with the tradition that you received from us to skip on down to verse 10. It says, For even when we were with you, we would give you this command, if anyone is not willing to work, let him not eat. For we hear that some among you walk in idleness, not busy at all, but busy bodies, not now such persons aren't we command and encouraged in the Lord Jesus Christ, to do their work quietly, and to earn their own living. Refusing to work, in essence, means we're refusing to do what God expects of us. Remember, we are all created to be workers. And about three times a day, our stomach reminds us of that. The proverb says a workers appetite works for him, his mouth, urges him on. So Paul says, One who refuses to work shall not eat. And Paul's firm about that, in verses 10 and 12, he commands, he commands that they do their work quietly and to earn their living, even invokes the name of Jesus. In this, he calls about he calls them to be encouraged, or he encouraged those rather in Lord Jesus Christ, to do their work quietly. Think about that. This work, eat principle is a universal

Curtis Byers  18:03
doesn't make any difference whether one is a Christian or not. If one refuses to work, then he should not eat. But a Christian, especially a Christian, as a Christian, has a duty to Jesus to work. Paul is insistent upon this point. Further, because he says, Not only should the Christian not eat, if he refuses the work of backhand, verse six, he says that he has to be isolated from other Christians. And again, he makes this a command. Let's be let me be clear. Paul's not talking about Ron Paul. He is talking about those who refuse to work, they will but life happens there are times when when get sick, or injured, or laid off perhaps due to some downturn in business. It is right and proper that we help such such a person in those times. But it is not compassionate to help those who refuse the work. It is disobedience. Paul makes similar comments similar comments over in letters he wrote to the both Ephesians and Colossians. These are two of the last letters that Paul wrote. He speaks specifically particularly to the attitude that a Christian ought to have toward his work. And Ephesians four, verse 28. The text says, Let the thief no longer steal, but rather let him labor doing honest work with his own hands, so that he may have something to share with anyone in need. In this passage, artists work is contract Akash, trashed it with thievery. We can steal from our in many ways we can steal from our employers. Also, if we don't do an honest day's work, if we waste time while we're on the clock, or worse if we Say we are working, we are not, we are stealing. And Paul would have none of that. This passage also says a lot about why we are to work. Not only are we to work to provide for ourselves and for our families to our knees, but also for the needs of others. There is an irony in this passage. Instead of stealing from others, we are to give to others. And notice that the difference the key to that is work. Work mitigates the reason why we might need to steal. And work provides us with the resources by which we are able to give work is the key. Oftentimes, the expression good works is what is the term that's used in Scripture, and New Testament particular to refer to those things that we do, and giving to others and helping others they are good works. Also Ephesians the sixth chapter, verses five and following Paul says this. He says, bondservants obey your earthly masters with fear and trembling with a sincere heart, as you would Christ, not by way of I serve as as people pleasers, but as Bond servants of Christ, doing the will of God from the heart, rendering service with a goodwill as to the Lord and not man. Knowing that whatever good anyone's does, he will receive us back from the Lord, whether he is a bond servant, or free. That passage is a significant passage, I think, because it because it tells us that secular work is sacred work, there is no distinction. But that I mean, we when we work for balls, we are also at the very same time working for lowered our secular in our sector work, which was our sacred work, we must be sincere, it must be done with a goodwill, it must be done hardly. And Peter, even as in his epistle of First Peter, the second chapter, he has to be subjected to your Masters With all respect not only to the good and gentle, but also to the unjust. Even if our boss has his false and probably most bosses do, we are to work for them. As if we are working for the Lord. I was adjusted, it might be helpful if we imagine that is the Lord who is signing our paycheck. That image is probably truer than we think.

Curtis Byers  22:47
Paul makes the same exact point in Colossians. The third chapter in verse 22, I won't read it, but he, but he felt it important to make that statement there as well. And these two letters, I might add, both Ephesians and Colossians were passed, undoubtedly all over the province of Asia. These were instructions that Paul felt compelled to give to Christians, the need and value of work. I have just four simple points, I'd like to make some practical points that we can think about as we close our lesson that might help us as we go about doing our work in our families. First, I would like to suggest that we need to teach our children to work. And when you start that when they're very young, you know, household chores, should be the rule they there shouldn't be the exception. And I think we need to be careful not to try to bribe our children to doing chores, is sends the wrong message. We give them a wrong view of life, if we think if we give them the impression that life can be done or can be had without work. And I think you know, at some point, we need to encourage our children's to go to work for someone else to work outside the home. I don't know exactly what ages I should be. But as I was suggested it should be earlier than later. I think we do our service our children right to service I in fact, I think we handicap our children. If it's not until they're 16 or 17 year old before we start preparing them for work. You may have been blessed materially that your children do not have to work. You may be able to provide everything that they could possibly need until the time they leave your home. But if you do that, I think you have handicap your child, you will give them the illusion of of a life that is not true. We need to teach our children to work and to be thankful that they have the ability to work and we need to teach them with be used and read the things that they acquire by working for the benefit of God On and for others is a blessing number two, it is a blessing, I think, very much so when families are able to be able to live on the income earned by the husband. But problems can arise if a man thinks that the income he earns is somehow his money. If they if he takes, takes the attitude that says he earned the money for that he can spend the money the way he chooses. And so he can go buy his toys, you know, you know what I mean? Guys are golf clubs, your new gun, your bass boat, you know, if we if we think that because we are in the money, that we can go and spend it the way we want to, we're only causing problems our home and we're not understanding the value of work. It should be considered family income. The stay at home mom works as hard and perhaps probably does work harder than the man. And both of them have contributed to the income that is earned by the husband. The husband could not do his job as well as he does. If his wife was not working hard on behalf of the family. You know, the husband has no right to go out and buy his toys simply because he was a wage earner. It is it is a family the money is a phantom family's money, and should be used for the benefit of the family. Thirdly, wives, if you are able to work at home, be thankful. Support your husband. speak well of him to others and to your children. Let your children understand the good thing that your your husband is doing that their father is doing, and bringing money into the home. Be content with the money he earns. Use it wisely. And do your job well at home because you too, are working for the Lord. You know we're all stewards, stewards of the great blessings that God has given each one of us the talents that we have the opportunities that we have, the knowledge we may have acquired to do certain things all have been given to us by the Lord. And we are stewards of the possessions that result from the use of those talents and opportunities and knowledge. We need to use them well. We need to give God the thanks to the glory for all that he has done. And let us be thankful for our work.

Curtis Byers  27:45
Let us use work to be a blessing not only to our families but to be a blessing to all. Revelation 14 Chapter verse 13. Says I heard a verse voice from heaven saying right this. Bless. Blessed are the dead who die the Lord from now on blessing indies as a spirit for they may rest of their labors for their deeds, follow them. When Dorcas died, to is remembered for her good works. Her wise use of those talents and abilities if she was given as she used on behalf of others. May we be so blessed to be remembered in the same way. If there isn't here this morning who need to respond to God's invitation we always offer that opportunity. God has blessed us through his son Jesus Christ to enable us to be forgiven of our sins. Then we can have peace with him and peace with one another. And he was subject to the invitation this morning. We are encouraged you to please come as we stand in saying
