Good morning. It's great to see all of you here today if you want to open up your Bibles to Romans chapter five. Romans chapter five, our family has had kind of a crazy week on Wednesday night, we were here at the building and had an unfortunate fall that transferred us to ended us up at the emergency room. And so we spent Wednesday night getting that taken care of. And about two weeks ago, on Easter Sunday, one of our children had an allergic reaction that sent us to the emergency room. So we are averaging one ER visit per week. And we hope to bring that number significantly down throughout the remainder of the year. But it is good to be with you here today thankful that all of our kids are doing well thank you so much for your prayers and words of encouragement and offers to help in in various ways. We're going to be looking at Romans, chapter five this morning, we've been studying Romans in our class on Wednesday nights. And I'd like to dive into this section here, the first part of Romans. If you've done any airline travel before, you've probably noticed that there are differences between how passengers are treated, there are different tiers different levels when it comes to the perks and the benefits that travelers receive. For example, on your larger flights, you have different classes of seats, there's first class, there's business class, there's priority economy, and then there's regular economy where you literally get to rub elbows with the person that's next to you. But they also give benefits to the frequent fliers, there's priority check in you have free drinks and snacks you can you can get through security faster. There's all types of benefits, you can get your seat upgraded, if you're at a flight and there's open availability. And then they also have those exclusive diamond member clubs. Have you ever seen one of those or been inside of one of them, they, they haven't been the airports and you can go in and relax and get free food. And just take it easy. All of these are benefits because of your status because they deem you as a valuable customer. Before we had kids, my wife and I were on a flight that was canceled and we got upgraded to first class. And to this day, that is still one of the best meals that I have ever had. And I'm not sure if that's because I was so tired and hungry but but it was amazing the perks for those a list travelers are real. Have you ever stopped to consider to think about the benefits that we have because we are in Jesus Christ.

The first part of the book of Romans Paul lays out this desperate state of humanity and the first three chapters he talks about how all people are under sin, how all of us have fallen short of the glory of God. But here in chapter five, he pivots and now there is this incredible picture. Because of what Jesus has done because of God's grace. We are justified by faith. And through Jesus Christ, we have received these incredible blessings and gifts, we now have an elite status before God, and all of the benefits and blessings that come with it. So let's consider this morning. The blessings that we have through Christ from this text and Romans chapter five Read with me Romans chapter five, beginning in verse one. It says Therefore since we have been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ. Through him we have also obtained access by faith into this grace in which we stand, and we rejoice in the hope of the glory of God. Not only that, but we rejoice in our sufferings, knowing that suffering produces endurance, and endurance produces character, and character produces hope. And hope does not put us to shame because God's love has been poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit, who has been given to us. For a while we was we were still weak at the right time Christ died for the ungodly, For one will scarcely die for a righteous person, though perhaps for a good person one would even dare to die, but God shows His love for us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us. Since therefore we have been justified by His blood, much more shall we be saved by Him from the wrath of God. For if while we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more now that we are reconciled, shall we be saved by His life. More than that we also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received reconciliation. There are so many blessings that we have in Christ, but I want to start in verse one. Notice what he says there. He says, Since therefore, are therefore since we have been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ. First one says that we have peace with God instead of being at war or at odds with God instead of being subjected to his punishment to his condemnation, there is, there is peace. Look at Romans chapter one and verse 18. Romans chapter one and verse 18. This is the bad news section of Romans. And this is what Paul says, The wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, ungodliness and unrighteousness were certainly common and rampant during that time and they are alive and well today. Later on, he says that they knew God but they did not honor or give thanks to him. Look at chapter two and verse five. In chapter two and verse five, he says, but because of your heart and penitent heart, you are storing up wrath for yourself on the day of wrath when God's righteous judgment will be revealed. He says that because of our stubbornness, or unwillingness to change, that we are storing up wrath for ourselves, you know, anyone who is stubborn, who is unwilling to change, I think all of us to a certain extent, inherited that gene, where we do the things that we want to do, we disregard God's will and turn away from his word, and thus expose ourselves to the wrath of God. Oftentimes, when people think about the book of Romans, they think about God's grace, about God's love about his mercy. But the first three chapters are really more about the bad news about what we had have done, what we haven't done and how that is leading us down this path of destruction. Open to the wrath of God. I have a friend, not here, but he was telling me a story about his two year old and they live in a one storey house, it's all the bedrooms are on the same level, but they have a playroom, a bonus room, that's three steps down off of where the kitchen is. And this little boy went and got one of the scooters down from the toys, and he brought it up into the kitchen and put it down on that hard tile. And he got at the end of the hallway and got a little got a little start there and started going. And he was just sailing down the hall, not a care in the world. It was like a little joyride had no idea that he was heading right for those stairs. And by the time mom and dad realized it, it was like slow motion, right? They saw it happening but there was nothing that they could do. And he just went head over his feet down the stairs. Thankfully, no stitches, just bruises. But people don't realize it but without Christ, spiritually speaking. That's, that's our state. That's what's happening to us on the outside, things look like they're going going great. Like life is moving along, that things are going well that we're headed in a good direction, but in reality, we are going right towards the cliff. And that's why what Paul says here in Romans chapter five should not be overlooked or under appreciated. Because we have been justified. We are no longer guilty in God's presence, we are no longer subject to his wrath. We're no longer headed towards the edge of that cliff. We have peace with God. There is no condemnation in Christ. In Romans chapter eight and verse one, Paul says, There is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus, being at peace with God means that we are no longer at opposite ends. We're no longer at odds with him. We've been saved and delivered from His judgment. Notice in verse one, how this happens or the means by which this happens. He says that we are justified by I faith. In verse two, he says, we have obtained access by faith. This comes by faith. It's not because of, we trust in our own abilities or our own strength or power, but we are instead in trusting ourselves to God by faith, this peace with God also means access. He says that we have now obtained access verse to by faith, instead of friction or conflict, there is this harmony, we have been afforded the ability to approach God. Do you remember in Exodus chapter 19, when the people came to Mount Sinai, as Moses was about to go up and receive the law, what was the scene that was happening there? The Bible tells us that the mountain was, it was covered in smoke, that there there was a burning fire that the the mountain was shaking, it was trembling, that there was the sound of a loud trumpet. And the decree went out, it said that no animal or man should approach the mountain, otherwise, they would be shot or stoned. But now in Christ, that's not that's not the case. That's not the scene we can approach God, not with trembling fear, or terror, or uncertainty. But we come boldly, Hebrews 416, when Jesus was crucified on the cross, and Matthew 27, and verse 51, it says that the veil of the temple was torn in two, there was this, this wall, this veil that was up between the presence of God and man, and only the high priest could enter into that most holy place, and only one time per year. But when that veil was torn, we can now approach God at any time through prayer, we can stand in His presence, and we are the recipients of His grace. And so what does this do for us knowing that we have this peace with God, it should bring us great joy. It says that we rejoice. In verse two, it says that through him, we have also obtained access by grace by faith into this grace in which we stand, and we rejoice in the hope of the glory of God. It causes us to rejoice to have hope. Because now in Christ there is this access to the Father. How do you feel when you've accomplished something big? How do you feel when you've completed something, maybe it's a project, maybe you've finally closed on the house, you've received the promotion that you've been working for? You've graduated from school, you've passed your last test? What what type of feelings are associated with those events? Right? We feel we feel happy, we feel excited. There's this feelings of euphoria that are going through us. But how long do those last? How long does that continue on?

Conrad Harkrider  13:05
The job disappoints. The next test comes the house breaks, the real world sets in, right? And we come off of the mountain top and then things sort of return back to normal. That's the nature of this world. There's nothing that is permanent. There's no feeling or, or gift or benefit that we could receive that's going to last forever in this life. But no, but that's not, but the peace, that we have this calm assurance that we receive in Jesus Christ. There is nothing that can take that away. There's nothing that can diminish it, that can reduce it. And no matter what is happening in our life, we can rest and take comfort, and be and stand firmly on the peace of God through Jesus Christ. So we think about what do I have going for me? What blessing do I have? What's going right? In my life when we're feeling empty? Like there's no light at the end of the road? We need to stop and reflect on this, this blessing. That we have this relationship with God that we have peace through Jesus Christ, because we are now connected to our father. Also, notice what verse three says, verse three, not only that, but we rejoice in our sufferings, knowing that suffering produces endurance and endurance, character and character produces hope. Not only do we have peace, but through Jesus Christ, we have perspective in our suffering. We have this perspective, this understanding awareness in our suffering. Paul says that we rejoice in suffering, how could a person rejoice in something that is that's painful All that's difficult, because in Christ, we have a different perspective, we have a different view on the world, we see our situation and what's happening to us. And we view it in a different light, we see it in a different way to rejoice and suffering does not mean that the Christian enjoys or welcomes pain. And Hebrews chapter 12, and verse 11, the writer says that these things are painful rather than pleasant. And they create real burdens, real challenges, mental, physical, emotional, from an earthly standpoint, there are different durations of suffering, some things are very short lived for a couple of days, or a couple of weeks you get sick, or you have some type of issue, you got a toothache that's can bring you down can knock you out for a couple of days. But if you get get some medicine, you go to the dentist's, you get that fixed and you're back on your feet. But there are other types of suffering that can last for years, things that are that are chronic in nature, diseases, or maybe even a difficult or hurtful relationship that we have the pain of losing someone that is close to us. These are burdens that are not easily removed or taken away. And oftentimes, when we are in when someone is in a trial like this for an extended period of time, that support system can start to wear down. At first people are doing whatever they can. They're offering words of encouragement, they're texting, they're calling, they're, they're offering to help. But over time, people start to get to fatigue, they start to wear down, maybe they forget about asking, they start to have their own problems. But for the person who's carrying that load, the burden is still there.

Conrad Harkrider  16:56
So how should we what are we to do if if these burdens can be carried for years at a time if they could last as long as a person is here on this earth? Paul says that the blessing that we have in Jesus Christ is that even if the burden is never taken away or removed, that our perspective about it has changed. Notice what verse three says, He gives a, a chain or a progression of events. He says that suffering produces endurance, it develops endurance, endurance produces character and character ultimately produces hope. It produces something within us. Endurance is being able to withstand something, it's it's being able to continue on. It's having resolve, it's keeping with it despite the stress or fatigue or some other type of adverse condition. If someone said that they are an endurance runner, and you say, Well, how long can you run? And they said, I can go about 20 seconds. You say, Well, you're not you don't have very much endurance, maybe you should try sprinting instead of long distance running. But how does a person get past that? 22nd? Mark, what do they have to do? They go out, and the next time they do 30 seconds? And then the next time they go for a minute? And then they do five minutes? And then all of a sudden they're able to run a mile? And did you know that there are people that have run marathons that when starting out, they could not even go 20 seconds? How do they do that because they continue to do more than they think they can. They and they they go through, they go through more. Endurance is not something that is developed overnight. It doesn't happen quickly. It is a slow process. It takes time. And notice that there's a step here in between suffering and character. He doesn't just say that suffering produces character. Suffering only produces character when there is endurance in between. When we continue on, when we don't give up when we don't quit or give up hope, not by our strength or our ability but through the Lord. He allows us to carry on. He says that endurance or persevere, perseverance produces character. The New American Standard says this is a proven character. This is this is who we are. Suffering has a way of shaping and molding us it causes us to rely on God. This morning our Bible class we talked about mourning and death and how that can give us a better perspective on life. It can show us our priorities, what really matters to help us have a better sense of gratitude and appreciation for what we do have suffered can change us for the better. This character ultimately produces hope, hope in something that's greater than this world. If everything was perfect in this life and things were always going the way that we hoped and planned and everything, and we never got sick or faced any challenges. Why would we ever want to leave? Why would we ever want to go and be with the Lord, we might want to stay here forever, but in this hope, when we face suffering, this hope reminds us that these things are short term, that this life is momentary, that no matter how difficult or permanent, a burden may seem, that one day these things will pass away in second Corinthians chapter four and verse 17. It says, For our light and momentary troubles are achieving for us in eternal weight of glory that far outweighs them all. The glory that we are going to receive in God, far outweighs it surpasses anything that we can face in this life. And that's the hope that we hold on to that we cling to knowing that God is faithful to His promises, that one day he will relieve us from the things that we face in this life. I like this quote from Mandy Hill.

Conrad Harkrider  21:32
She said, God knows what you're ready for. He knows what your arms are able to carry. He knows what your heart can contain. He knows what's coming, and he knows how and when to prepare you for it. He knows the right time, the right place, the right person, the right answer. He knows. So you don't have to. And isn't that a comfort that we don't. We don't have to know how every step of the way is going to work out we can continue to put our trust and faith in God knowing knowing that he will hold us up. Suffering gives us greater perspective. God gives us this blessing through Jesus Christ. Also notice through Jesus Christ we receive His love. We receive God's love through Christ's Look at Verse eight, it says but God shows His love for us. In that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us. God shows he demonstrates His love towards us through the sacrifice of Jesus Christ. How do you know that your parents love you? How do you know that your grandparents your aunt, your uncle, someone that cares about you? How do you know that they love you? When I was about five years old, one year for Christmas, I wanted a red scooter. Red scooter I was talking about it mom and dad read scooter red scooter, every day reminding them about the red scooter Christmas rolled around and guess what I got for Christmas. I got some clothes, and a brand new read Skooter. We know that mom and dad we know that they care about us because they give us the things that we need. They give us far more. They give us the things that we want that we ask for. God gave us the greatest gift that has ever been given. He offered his Son, Christ died for us. That's how we know. That's how he demonstrates he shows his love for every person that's living today. And the most amazing part about this, look at what he says in verse six. When did Christ die? When did God decide to offer this gift? It says for a while we were still weak at the right time Christ died for the ungodly. For one will scarcely die for a righteous person though perhaps for a good person, one would dare even to die. But God shows His love for us and that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us. Most of us, if not all of us would be willing to die to give our lives for someone that we truly care about. If one of our children were in danger, we would put ourselves at risk. We would give up ourselves for a family member for someone that is close to us. But what about someone that you that you work with? Would you give your life for them? What about one of your neighbors? Is that the guy across the street or two doors down? You know because it kind of depends. We don't want to we're not so eager to offer up our own lives for someone if they're not deserving. What about someone who has been convicted of a crime? Would you trade places with a person who's been incarcerated? Would you give up your life for a drug addict for a child molester a murderer? Would you give up one of your children, for someone like that? God demonstrates His love towards us. Because when we were sinners, Christ died for us. That's how he describes us. In verse six. He says that we were weak and helpless. He says that we were ungodly. In verse six, in verse eight, he refers to us as sinners. We were weak, ungodly sinners. And what did God do when we're in that state? Did he cast us off? Did he punish us because of our weakness and our sin? did he allow us to live but he just brought us in to make us His slaves to serve under him? No, instead, he offered up the most valuable and precious gift in all of humanity, so that we could become his children. In verse 10, Paul writes that, while we were enemies with God, that's when Christ died for us. This amazing gift is not just meant to impress us. Or

Conrad Harkrider  26:24
it's not just some great thing to talk about. But it should change the way that we live. Since God has demonstrated His love towards us, that causes us to draw closer to Him, to have a greater appreciation and sense of gratitude for what he's done. First, John, chapter four and verse 19, says that we love because he first loved us, our whole life should now be lived in a way that is in response to God's love. We're not motivated because of fear or regret, or because of some sense of duty or obligation. We see what God did on our behalf and we love him. What would be your response if someone gave you if they donated one of their organs to you? Not after they've died? But while they were still living? They made the choice to give you something to give you this gift so that your life could continue on? Would you be grateful? Would you be thankful? Would you love that person? We offer our hearts and our lives to God because of what he has given to us what he's done for us. In Romans chapter eight and verse 32. It says, He who did not spare His own Son, but gave him up for us all, how will He not also with Him, graciously give us all things. This is the blessing that we receive. In Christ through Jesus Christ, we now know God's love, we are recipients of His love. And finally, notice what he says in verse 10. In verse 10, he says, For if, while we were still, while we were enemies, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more now that we are reconciled, shall we be saved by His life? More than that, we also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have received reconciliation, did you see that word reconciled reconciliation, that was repeated there a few times, but we rejoice in God because we have been reconciled to God, through Jesus Christ, we have received this reconciliation. As we said earlier, before, before Christ, there was separation, there was hostility, there was enmity between us and God, there was distance between us. That's one of the saddest things to see in families, isn't it? When there's some type of division that occurs, there's a divorce, or there's a dispute that arises, maybe because of inheritance or money or, or jealousy, or pride or whatever it may be. And now all of a sudden, you have people who once were very close, they talked to all the time they spent time together, they cared about each other. Now, they can't even be in the same room. It can't even talk to one another. That relationship is severed. And that's what we see in the prodigal son when he, he goes to the Father, he asks for his inheritance, he's ready to go and see the world to do things the way that he wants. And oftentimes, those situations can seem hopeless, but there is always There's always hope. As long as there's life, people can change, those wounds can be restored, and they can bring the relationship back together again. And what an amazing thing if you've seen that were two people who had been at odds who are at a distance with one another for so long and they are brought back together there. is reconciliation. It's an incredible thing when people are willing to bend and submit, and be brought back together. And that's what we see in the story of of Christ and redemption and being saved. It is a story of reconciliation, about how each one of us decided to leave to walk away or to turn away from the family of God, from the One who created us. But in Christ, we are brought back we are joined together again with our father. And the point that he's making in verse 10. He says that, if God gave His Son for us when we were enemies, when we were at odds with him, how much more is he going to do for us now that we are His children? How much more will he do to help us to strengthen us now that we do love him that we are trying to serve Him and seek after his ways, he will strengthen us He will freely give us all things. And this is ultimately why we rejoice. When Adam and Eve sinned in the garden,

Conrad Harkrider  31:10
there was a special relationship that existed. But when they turned against God, when they disobeyed his word, that relationship was broken, they were forced to leave God's presence, and things would never be the same. There was no amount of good there was no amount of great things that Adam and Eve could do that would place them back in the garden that would allow them to have that access to God. But because of the sacrifice of Christ, that special relationship that once existed between God and man has been repaired, it's been restored, we now have access to God through Jesus Christ, we can stand in His presence. And one day those who are faithful, will again be granted. The ability to have access to that tree of life where we can stand in God's presence, and live with Him for eternity. These are the blessings that we have in Jesus Christ, this peace with God, this perspective on our life, on suffering on tragedy on the things that happen in this world. We have a greater understanding of God's love. It's been demonstrated to us. And most of all, we have been reconciled back into the family of God and there is nothing that can take that away from us. We're going to close this morning with a song we use it as a, an opportunity to encourage all who are here. If there's something that you need to do, to make that relationship that walk that connection with God, to make it what it ought to be. We want to help you in that way. If you need to respond to the Lord's invitation, please come down to the front as we stand and sing
