It is always a pleasure and a privilege to come and worship our great God to give Him the glory that is due his name and to be strengthened in our faith as we seek to be faithful to him in the midst of the challenges that we each face in our life. We all face difficulties. And it's so beneficial to come and worship God together as we journey to the place that he is prepared for us in heaven. Appreciate the songs that brother Swafford live this evening. Appreciate your prayer norm as we acknowledge God's power and Providence in our lives. And he gives us strength for the difficulties that we face as we put our trust in Him. Appreciate the Bible class that we've been having on Sunday morning, Jim Hawkins class on Ecclesiastes, it reminds us that apart from God, life is meaningless. And man's basic responsibility is to fear God to keep His commandments. And so it's a great reminder for all of us also enjoy the enjoy the class that Conrad has been teaching on Romans, we realized that nobody can have access to God except on the basis of faith in Christ at all are guilty of sin, Jew and Gentile. And we need to also appreciate the grace. And the hope that we have the peace with God is as he mentioned this morning, and to appreciate being reconciled with God through the blood of Jesus Christ since we've been looking at Romans here this morning. In addition to Conrad's lessons, I finally go ahead and jump to the end of the chapter, the end of Romans, and look at Romans chapter 16. So I don't think I'll be stepping on Conrad's material at all, because I don't think it's gonna gonna get to it this quarter. But we're gonna be looking at Romans chapter 16. So if you get your Bibles open there, you might want to turn and look at that chapter with me this evening. Sometimes in preaching, we focus on a single word in the scriptures, whether it's like ecclesia, a baptism by pizza, we just build the whole lesson on that sometimes we look at a single verse of scripture. Sometimes we look at a whole chapter and this evening, I want to do that with you. When I think about some favorite chapters that I have in the Bible, I've got a handful of them. One of them is Isaiah chapter 40, which extols God's incomparable greatness. It's just a lot of good chapter. But Romans chapter 16, is a chapter perhaps, that you haven't thought about in terms of a like a horrible Hallmark chapter. If I want to suggest that there's some powerful lessons in Romans chapter 16, that we can glean and learn from. So I'm going to be looking at Romans chapter 16, this evening. And again, looking at some lessons that God teaches us

Mike Roy  02:41
in this particular chapter, and so my lesson is titled, God's great big family. And that's one of the things that comes through one of the messages that comes to me in Romans chapter 16, we see a picture of God's family, just as we see a picture this evening of us, we're in the family of God, we're in the body of Christ, we all have different roles to play with. We all have strengths and weaknesses, success and failure, but we all have a part that we can play in God's kingdom. So Romans, chapter 16, shows us a picture of God's great big me, at least among Christians, area of Rome, and maybe some other areas of the Roman Empire at that time. And so we'll be looking at Romans chapter 16, and gleaning some lessons that that God is trying to convey to us. So we're not going to read the chapter to begin with, but we will be going through that, and looking at many of these verses, but I've put together several several points that I want us to take into our minds this evening. And the first one I want to suggest to you is from Romans chapter 16, that the church is a big family. And we need to continually show love and appreciation to each other. No matter if the old or young have a key role in the local church here at Broadmoor, wherever you might worship. We are a family or the family of God, we talk about our church family, that's that's who we are. And so, because we are a family, we need to continually constantly show love and encouragement to each other as we serve God in His Kingdom. It's interesting that this chapter is filled with personal greetings again, we think about what stands out in this chapter in Romans chapter 16, which I'm kind of setting forth as a very valuable one chapter a study in the Bible is the incredible number of personal greetings. Approximately 40 individuals are named in this chapter 40 individuals are named in this chapter. A number of churches referenced here, several household and out of 2027 verses in this chapter 20 are expressions of warmth and appreciation for someone or a church meeting in their home. So out of 27, verses 20 of them are expressions of love and encouragement to these various church members. So

Mike Roy  05:09
the picture that we have is the church is not a building, we understand that I grew up in a Catholic culture, Catholic Church, and in our minds, the church was a building, we know that that's not the case. The church is the people we are the people. In Romans chapter 16, shows us that the church is a big family. And we all have a part to play in God's scheme of things. But there has to be a love, a caring and encouragement that that takes place within the body of Christ. Here's just a few verses, I'll get these on the screen. Notice what Paul says to the Christians in Colossi it says For I want you to know how great a struggle I have for you. And for those who are at those at Laodicea. And for all who have not seen see me face to face, if their hearts may be encouraged, being knit together in love to reach all the riches of full assurance of understanding and the knowledge of God's mystery, which is Christ. What a phrase here, Paul wants these people who didn't know him personally didn't have that face to face relationship. He wants these Christians to be knit together in love. That's the picture of a family closeness, caring, warmth, intimacy, encouragement. That's the characteristic and one of the characteristics of God's Church. And that's something that we continually strive for. I think here in Broadmoor, we certainly reached a level of encouragement and warmth and caring for one another yet, we still need to do even more and more GET TO KNOW members that maybe we don't spend much time with maybe get your, your favorite franchise or your favorite few that you might hang around with, reached out to somebody else who maybe a different background, different educational status, we are family, we're planning to spend eternity with each other with lots of other people in heaven. So the language here is that Paul encourages us to encourage one another, with hearts to knit together in love with a picture that is compelling for us. Also, in First Thessalonians chapter four, verses nine and 10. Paul writes this to the Thessalonian Christians, he said, not concerning brotherly love, you have no need for anyone to write to you, for you, yourself have been taught by God to love one another. For that is indeed what you are doing to all the brothers throughout Macedonia. But notice what he says he said, he been taught to love one another, right. And we need to be taught to love one another to be kind to understanding compassion, to appreciate each other. And then he says, but we urge you brothers to do this more and more. We cannot love each other too much. We can't. And we need to do more and more of that to get out of our comfort zone, we so often talk about it to have hearts to knit together. In Love. I think about after my conversion, I spent almost two years in the island of Okinawa, Japan in the Navy. And one of the benefits of being in such a small group over there, we might have had 25 or 30 people and we all took turns preaching and leading singing Yes, I did that in my younger days. That type of thing. But, but living in a different culture, you know, the Japanese culture which was friendly to Americans, I would say overall, but as a body of Christ, we were like a family. It was what was time for somebody to leave the island, whether it was an Air Force member or navy member, when somebody would leave, they'd be tears of sadness. Now that one of our family members is leaving the island, and hopefully somebody will come and replace that person. And so, again, that the charge here is for us to continue to express that love and appreciation to one another. So again, we see that this first point, the picture, that the church is a big family of God's people, I think we need to realize also the need to stay closely connected to each other. So easy, so easy for me. It's easy for all of us to somehow get disconnected at times and to be isolated. And maybe we all have issues and struggles and it's hard to open up and share those things that we might be dealing with. But we need to stay connected to each other and reach that level of intimacy. And that means is since we're part of a family of God that we we need to be active in worship. And I think it's it's commendable on a Sunday evening, not knowing what to expect. We have a full house, as it's a tribute, I think, to the character of the Christians here at Broadmoor. So the first picture I see in Romans chapter 16, in this last chapter of the book, Rome is that Gods we see that the Lord's Church is a big family and we need to grow in our love for each other. Secondly, as I look at this chapter, again, we raised the question what sticks out in my I'm on what sticks out in Jeremiah. Chris, you haven't read this yet. And we'll we'll get to that in due time. But what sticks out in my mind is that how many women, those the large number of women who are serving God's cause God's kingdom in various ways. So I want to suggest Secondly, from Romans chapter 16, which may not be a passage or a chapter that you think about is one of the significant chapters in the Bible. But there are lots of ways that Christian women can serve God without violating the scriptures. We live in a culture where women in denominational churches are

Mike Roy  10:32
promoted to pastor and they're doing all these things, in terms of preaching God's Word, God has not given the work of preaching and overseeing his flock to women. But there are lots of ways that women can serve. So let's look at the context over here in Romans chapter six. And verses one and two will begin with a reference to Phoebe. Paul says, I commend to you our sister Phoebe who was a servant of the Church, which is at centria, that she received her in the Lord in a manner worthy of the saints, and that you help her in whatever manner she may have need of, for she herself has also been a helper of many, I think, ESPs as a patron of many and of myself as well. So Phoebe, who was Phoebe, I don't know a whole lot about her. But Paul says he has been a helper. She had been an assistant to me, she'd been a patron of me and of many others. She's a servant of the church there. And she's doing a lot of things, maybe behind the scenes type of things, and helping in the spiritual work of evangelism and maybe meeting the needs of others. So Bibi is singled out. And Paul commended her very highly for her good work. Then you see verses three through five Prisca, or Priscilla and Aquila. And so in verse three, Paul says, greet Prisca and Aquila, my fellow workers in Christ Jesus, who have who for my life risked their own necks, to whom not only do I give thanks, but also the churches of the Gentiles also greet the church that is in their house. So the church was meeting we forget sometimes that the group the Lord's people met in people's homes. We did that in Japan. And actually, a lot of places around the world still do that church buildings are convenient, they're nice and all that type of thing. But we see in Scripture, so many situations where the Lord's people were meeting, and Christians homes and in that setting is of course, it's natural to have a level of closeness there. But Paul is commending Aquila Corson in his work of teaching God's word, but Priscilla, she was his assistant. They were working together a hand in hand in, in teaching others especially think about apologist. So Paul identifies Priscilla or Prisca. As as worthy of appreciation, saying that they She, along with her husband have risked their necks risks risked their lives for the gospel. And we continue down to verse six. He mentions Mary, so know a lot about Mary, but it says the Greek Mary, who has worked hard for you, wow. I don't know much about Mary Dewey. But she was a hard worker in God's kingdom. And she was working for maybe the benefit of these Christians here at Rome. Then he come down to verse 12. He mentioned all these others over here in Maine, so they have a hard time pronouncing But verse 12 is a Greek try fina and try Bossa workers in the Lord. And I did somebody suggested that these these may be sisters, I don't know but it may well be so his again Paul's sending this farewell greeting to the church at Rome and he mixes all these women over and over and over again. So try thena and try fossa will work as in Lord. Also in the same verse. It says greet persist, the beloved, who has worked hard in the Lord, all these women doing various things, spiritual activities in God's kingdom, many of them working in connection with Paul in some ways. So that's first well, verse 13 mensches Rufus that's not our Rufus but a different Rufus. Great Rufus a choice man in the Lord and his mother and his mother and mine so he said greet Rufus that choice man but greet his mother, who was Rufus it right. So this he's talking about Rufus, his mother, who also served as Paul's mother. So again, very complimentary things Paul is saying about these women. And then in verse 15, it says, Great Phil Agus and Julia,

Mike Roy  14:58
then Naruto and his sister. So that's neurosis sister and Olympus, and all the saints who are with them. But make the point here, just to say that there's a lot of emphasis. When you look at this one chapter in the book of Romans, we see the valuable roles that so many of these women played in the early churches, and how much Paul appreciated them for that so many times we think, Oh, I can't be a preacher, and woman thinks that or I can't be an elder. No, but think about all the things that you can do. And Paul fills up much of Romans chapter 16, commending the women for the work that they have done and we certainly recognize here in Broadmoor, how much the women are doing, have them continue to do. So just as a reminder, don't feel slighted in any way, don't feel because you're not in the front row, so to speak, the front lines, that your work is invaluable in God's eyes, your work is valuable. And all these women are commended for what they're doing in God's kingdom. Again, think about the personal connection they had with the Apostle Paul. Also, you read in various commentaries, maybe especially denominational commentaries. A lot of people have the idea of Paul hated women probably have heard that before. You know from from his teaching in First Timothy Chapter Two, First Corinthians chapter 14, I don't permit them to speak, etc. And that's not the case. This again, this clearly dispels this idea that Paul hated women. That's not the case. He loved women, he loved these sisters in Christ. And so Romans, chapter 16, shows us all the ways that these women are involved in the spiritual activity of maybe teaching, helping meeting the needs of others doing all types of things, but they do spiritual work for the Lord. In many cases, they are right there along with Paul helping Paul. So think about how much Paul accomplished but a lot of that was in connection with some of these, these Christian ladies doing that. The third point I want us to notice this evening, think I've got six I want to look at tonight. Again, looking at Romans chapter 16. And you might leave your marble open right there. One of the messages coming to me from this chapter is that there needs to be a closeness, a warmth and an intimacy within the body of Christ that is sometimes lacking in our churches today. So here's the verse I want you to think about which gave rise to this point. So verse 16, we just read them down in verse 15. But verse 16, says this, greet one another with a holy kiss. All the churches of Christ greet you. I remember after my conversion, 1978 ounce Sunnyvale, California, and get familiar with this. First, all the churches of Christ greet you. I knew that first I quoted that verse. I eat, ate, drank and breathed that verse. But I didn't really notice what I said before that greet one another with a holy kiss.

Mike Roy  18:01
Wow. That's part of the Scripture. And maybe we say, well, maybe that was a cultural thing. And, and obviously, he's not talking about a romantic or sexual kiss here. But this is biblical instruction. I mean, we have to raise the question Is this some aberration that Paul was okay, just slip this verse in, in one verse, an entire book of the Bible, but that's not the case. As you come to the end of his not only the end of Romans, you come to the end of Corinthians system when he says the churches of ages send you greetings, Aquila, and Prisca. Together with the church in your house and you hearty greetings in the Lord. All the brothers send you greetings. Greet one another with a holy kiss. So the book of Romans ends that way, the book of Corinthians ends that way. Second, Corinthians ends the same way by the brothers rejoice. Aim for restoration, comfort one another, agree with one another, live in peace and the God of love and peace will be with you. And in verse 12, greet one another with a holy kiss. You see that the level of intimacy and warmth and connection that we find the Scripture says, and it's not just Paul, who talked about this, and these are, this is biblical instruction. Right, it's in there right next to all the other charges. And First Thessalonians chapter five, the end of this epistle, Paul says, Brothers, pray for us. Greet all the brothers, with a holy kiss. I put you under oath before the Lord have this letter read to all the brothers. So this alone he is as with that message, of greeting with one another with a holy kiss. And then Peter closes out his epistle this way away, man, this is not this is not a an aberration. Almost at every turn of the scriptures we find this instruction to greet one another with this says over here a kiss of love. At So again, the point that I make over here that this this this type of instruction is not talking about any type of a romantic or sexual kiss. It's really an embrace of, of affection. And very often will you see that between people have of the same sex. It's interesting to think about when when Judas betrayed Jesus, how did he do that? He betrayed Him with a kiss, didn't he? And so we just thinking about outside of our culture for just a moment in the European culture, it's common for men to embrace one another and they touch you know, cheek with each other a full embrace type thing. I remember years ago, when Hannah was a school in Hendersonville, she had a couple students came from Chile, a brother and sister came to the school. And so it was her job to introduce them to the system, the class and whatever. And so when she met this, this brothers sister from Chile, they asked her the question, you know, how do people in the US greet one another? And Han? I'm sure I can envision it. We shake hands. Right? I'm almost certain I wasn't there. But I'm almost certain it was something like that. And she said, Well, how do you embrace it? How do you greet one another in Chile, she said, We kiss one another. And Hannah was kind of taken aback by that. Again, this not a sexual kiss, but they embraced, you know, so our customers, we give a warm handshake. But but there are times especially when we realized the need for deeper connections helps we give a bear hug, you know, to guys hug like that. And, in fact, that had some lunch this morning, Antonio spent some time with this. And so when saying goodbye, just he gives them a handshake, I give him a handshake. And Carol gives me a hug. Well, that's, that's better. Right?

Mike Roy  21:56
And, and Miss Betty, that's her trademark, right? You come in here, she's not going to give you a handshake. She's going to give you a hug, a hug of love, right. And so this is biblical teaching, that we've got to go back, I think and look at. And so it reminds me that the God wants us to develop a level of closeness, that's hard to achieve some times because of human nature. So when we leave this evening, if you see John Dukes come up to me, big, burly, hairy guy and gives me a big bear hug. And I feel that all over my face, it's okay. It's okay to do that. So don't be alarmed by that. So anyway, again, it's a reminder that we, we do need to achieve that level of closest and look at these verses on your own time. The fourth point, I want us to recognize from this chapter, after looking at verse 16, we need to recognize that in order to maintain doctrinal purity, we sometimes must identify and withdraw ourselves from false teachers. You see that in verses 17 through 20. This is not a popular topic, to mention. But notice what Paul says in verse 17 Is the now I urge you, brethren, keep your eye on those who cause dissent, chants and hindrances contrary to the teaching which you learn and turn away from them. For such men are slaves, none of our Lord Christ, but of their own appetites. And by their smooth and flattering speech, they deceived the hearts of us of the unsuspecting, for the report of your obedience is reached to all, therefore I am rejoicing over you, but I want you to be wise and what is good and innocent and what is evil, the God of peace will soon crushed Satan under your feet. So here's some plain language that Paul says, you you watch out, you mark you you use, you find out who's teaching things that are false as concrete that were a god, and you turn away from them, you avoid them, you mark them. That's again, it's possible sometimes, for preachers to make this a hobby that they want to identify every false teacher into brotherhood. And we don't want to go that route of overkill, so to speak. But we got to recognize that in our spirit in our religious culture, most of what we hear from the religious leaders and Gandhi, I grew up in the head of the Catholic Church grew up in the Catholic Church and the Pope is the the head of that organization, much of what he teaches is not true. And we have to be willing to say that. So Paul tells us to mark those who are teaching things that are contrary to the scriptures, avoid them turn away from them. So Romans, chapter 16, is filled with lots of instructions of a very practical nature that we need to meet to be thinking about. And so especially when we think about the work of preaching and those and shepherding God's people, that's the work really the work of elders in particular, but preachers as well. It As to protect the flock against false teaching and false teachers. Number five, the point that I want to bring to your attention from Romans chapter 16, a chapter that we wouldn't really maybe think much about. We need to look for the small behind the scenes ways that you can glorify God with your talents. We read down in verse 20. And look over here in verse 21, Timothy, my fellow worker greets you, and so and so do Lucia and Jason and so separator my kinsman. And in verse 22, it puts us on the screen for an application. I Tertius, is how my Bible app pronounced that I Tertius, who wrote this letter, greet you in the Lord, who wrote the book of Romans, Paul did know he didn't turn Tertius did who's Tertius? I don't know. But Tertius was a pen in God's hand. Think about how many people have been impacted by the book aroma, and we're studying it on Sunday mornings. And Tertius is the guy who sat at Paul's feet in dictation, and wrote the book of Romans. Most of the time, we totally forget about that. And so the point is, you know, most of us will never have the influence of the apostle Paul or people like that, in the Lord's church, many will ever, never be a preacher or elder or song leader. But think about the little ways that we can glorify God, like we say, behind the scenes just like this man did. And so then really, this chapter is filled with people, like Tertius isn't how I said it. Tertius

Mike Roy  26:53
for this chapter is filled with people like that we can't even pronounce their names, but they made an impact in God's kingdom. And whether it's a woman or a man, we can all have an opportunity to make a difference in God's kingdom. But I got one other point that I want to mention this evening from this chapter. And that is to suggest as you come towards the end of the chapter, that it's really it's all about God. And it's all about bringing the whole world to him through the gospel of Jesus Christ. Look at verses 25 Down to verse 27. Is Paul concludes his Book of Romans. This would you say, is not the him who was able to establish you according to my gospel, and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery, which has been kept secret for long ages past, but now is manifested, and by the Scriptures of the prophets, according to the commandment of the eternal God has been made known to all the nations leading to obedience of faith. That's one of the phrases that we see we I think you've already seen in our class on Sunday morning leading to the to obedience of faith, to the only wise God through Jesus Christ be the glory forever, amen. So the goal of preaching the gospel is to bring about the obedience of the faith to all people, the Jew and the Gentile. That's what we've been studying about in our class. And so when you look at the end of this chapter, at the end of this chapter, which is the end of the book, it's a reminder that this life is all about God. It's all about glorifying God. And it's all about bringing every person possible to God Himself through the gospel of Jesus Christ. So many times we think about what we're gonna do, we're gonna go to school, who we're gonna marry, and what kind of house we're gonna live in, what kind of car I want to drive, and what kind of neighborhood I want to live in, and all this other stuff. It's up to all those things to some degree, but what our lives should be consumed with bringing neighbors, friends, fellow classmates, fellow co workers to the obedience of the faith before the day of judgment. So Romans chapter 16, to me has been one of my favorite chapters in the Bible, hope that it is for you as well, a lot of great lessons there. But the question that we'll leave you with this evening is this question, since it is describing God's church as a great big family? Are you in the family of God? Maybe there's someone here tonight, don't know if that's the case or not, you've not obeyed the gospel, you're not and in God's family, if that's the most important thing for you to do before you die, get into God's family through faith in Christ who repenting of your sins, confess your faith in Him. And then when you baptize Romans chapter six teaches us that, that we connect with the blood of Christ with the sacrifice of Christ and we're forgiven of our sins, God as us to his church. If you haven't done that, we would urge you to do that if you need the prayers in his congregation for the trials and difficulties that you've faced. You might come forward while we stay in the sing the invitation song
