Unknown Speaker  00:00
Good evening, everyone. Good to see you out tonight, when I encourage you to take your Bibles, we're going to start in the book of Acts, chapter 19. Oftentimes, at the beginning of the year, we make resolutions, don't we. And those might be all kinds of things they may be, I'm resolving to exercise more, to eat better. By the way, the those two are often most made. I'm going to read my Bible more. And so whatever it is, maybe I'm going to improve my golf game, read more books, we come up with this whole list of things, and we are encouraged to. And I would say, personally, I think it's a good idea every year to give our life some kind of reflection of what's gone on in the previous year, and some kind of challenge for the upcoming year. But how many of those resolutions do we make at the beginning of the year are kept. I mean, all the way out to the end like January the first of the following year, you are still pursuing that result. And you know, as well as I do, that the statistics are more than 75% of New Year's resolutions

Unknown Speaker  01:50
are broken. And they're not picked back up.

Unknown Speaker  01:54
I would suggest to you that the reason they're not picked back up is a resolution was not actually made. It was kind of I would like to lose weight, I would like to read some books, I would like for my golf game to be better. But it wasn't a resolve. I would suggest to you that there is a large difference. In our lives, there come times when we need to make a resolution. Even after we've become Christians, we need to make some new resolves. And sometimes those resolves create a revolution in our life. So tonight, I want to go on a short journey with you. And I want to talk about what this resolve is. And then at the end of the lesson, some practically some practical lessons on what does a resolution revolution look like in our life? Let's begin in the book of Acts in chapter 19. I want to suggest that our resolution what we are revolting against so often is mediocrity. In the book of Acts chapter 19. Paul is in the city of Ephesus. And many people are converted. I want you to see what happens here. One, a couple of small verses, verse 18, let's begin. And many who had believed came confessing and telling their deeds. Also, many of those who had practice magic, brought their books together and burned them in the sight of all and they counted up the value of them. And it totaled 50,000 pieces of silver. Brother and these are brand new Christians brand new Christians. And they realized that the books that they were using to conjure up spells or cast spells or some kind of extra biblical extra God way. They realized they could not keep those.

Unknown Speaker  04:41
So what did they do?

Unknown Speaker  04:44
They didn't just burn a book. It would be like a preacher burning a Bible. It would be like a lawyer burning all of his previous case books. would be like a musician, a paid musician, destroying their instruments. These books were their livelihood. It's how they made money. And what did they do when they found that they were wrong? They shouldn't be having him.

Unknown Speaker  05:23
Wow.

Unknown Speaker  05:26
Which brings us to ask a question. What is a resolution? If I asked you, maybe some of you would say it's a decision to which I will tell you that that's close. On January 1, many of you made a decision to do something different in your life. Did you keep it? See a decision can be made about anything. Yesterday, I got home from work.

Unknown Speaker  06:04
And I was tired.

Unknown Speaker  06:07
So I'm talking to Lisa on the phone. And she said, how was your day and told her all about it? And I said, I'm just beat.

Unknown Speaker  06:16
And I made a decision. I said, let's have some pizza. And we did.

Unknown Speaker  06:25
That's not what a resolution is. It's not just a decision. It is a firm, adamant decision that whatever it takes to accomplish that goal, that's what you will do. That is a resolution. That's why on January 1, many of us make decisions and not resolutions. So when we talk about something to resolve, we are talking a bout a strong decision. How many of us have ever made a weenie decision?

Unknown Speaker  07:10
Think we probably all have,

Unknown Speaker  07:12
you know, that decision I just described. That is I want something I have a mental desire for something. But I don't have it so greatly that I'm willing to do anything for it. That's that I wish I could learn, lose 20 pounds. And you go for about a week doing what you think you need to be doing. And then you fall off the wagon wants and then you go

Unknown Speaker  07:41
well, not this time.

Unknown Speaker  07:44
Because a decision was made a weenie decision a week decision, not a resolution. What about Have you ever known of a person that seems to love God with everything that

Unknown Speaker  08:04
they have?

Unknown Speaker  08:06
When I was in school, one of our elders was teaching a class on faith.

Unknown Speaker  08:18
And he was in his 80s at the time.

Unknown Speaker  08:22
And I remember him saying in that class, you know, I always thought it was pretty neat. That when I fly somewhere, that the entire plane, whether they're Christians or heathens gets the benefit of my prayers.

Unknown Speaker  08:42
And I when Wait,

Unknown Speaker  08:45
what? You see that brother

Unknown Speaker  08:52
had been trusting God

Unknown Speaker  08:56
for over 70 years.

Unknown Speaker  09:00
And he trusted

Unknown Speaker  09:03
that when he gave a prayer of protection on that airplane, that God would deliver him and everybody on that plane got to

Unknown Speaker  09:15
benefit from it.

Unknown Speaker  09:19
I think that was one of my first introductions to a man who had faith that I had never seen before.

Unknown Speaker  09:27
But how did it get that way?

Unknown Speaker  09:30
How did it get to a place where he is so confident that he speaks so confidently and maybe perhaps more intimately? Do you love God that way? In such a way that you trust Him, that when you give those prayers, you have every expectation that God will grant you what you ask,

Unknown Speaker  09:57
according to his will And if you don't? Why not? What prevents us from having that kind of faith, that kind of resolve

Unknown Speaker  10:16
to serve the Lord. I would suggest to you that resolving to follow God, completely, and with total trust is not an act to obey. But brethren, it is a heart that is stormed and enveloped by the love, grace

Unknown Speaker  10:45
and mercy of God. That

Unknown Speaker  10:51
causes a resolution in us spiritual resolutions, let me ask you, before we go on how many of us, I'm gonna raise my hand first, raise your hand if you feel comfortable? How many of you, how many of us have ever struggled? Reading the Bible on a consistent basis? anybody other than me? The rest of you need to come forward. Okay? Because what about struggles in prayer? Anybody? You know, you wish man? Why don't I pray more need to I would suggest that you can know the Bible front to back, quote, scripture in everything. But if your heart is not completely resolved, to search, and to seek and to know your Creator, that you will probably continue to struggle

Unknown Speaker  11:59
with those things.

Unknown Speaker  12:04
I would suggest to you that human beings always do the things that are important to them. Always. Every two weeks, I look forward to my account, being paid by my company. And guess what happens if I don't get paid every two weeks? Well, Lisa's going, Jason, we got bills coming out or we had debt, this or that or the other. And all of a sudden that becomes very important, doesn't it? What about seeking after God, creating a firm resolve to do whatever it takes to know God. Remember, when Paul was at Mars Hill, and he was talking to the unknown God, and he said, he is close to us, even if we would grope for him. And that word in the Greek actually means to feel around as if blind or in the dark. We are searching and looking for him. But so often, we come to Christ and were baptized into the waters and now we're a Christian. And we get complacent and mediocre about searching and seeking after God.

Unknown Speaker  13:38
And we can't have that. We've got to have

Unknown Speaker  13:43
something to grow, grasp onto. So just for a moment, let's let's go here just for a second. Why would God do all of this for us? Why would he do for us something that we needed to grab on to? You remember the apostle Paul, who was Sol at the time, just as a reference in Acts chapter nine, you talk about God storming a man literally sees the bright light hears the voice of Jesus himself and the one that had been kicking against the goads. And now God hand picked

Unknown Speaker  14:26
Saul to take the gospel specifically to the Gentiles.

Unknown Speaker  14:31
Wow. And what happened after that? How many of you have ever read through the New Testament and said, Boy, man, if I could be like, Paul, Holy guacamole, this whole city would be converted?

Unknown Speaker  14:47
That's a good question. Why aren't we? What stops us from being that kind? Mind of commitment.

Unknown Speaker  15:03
Is it the Lord stopping us? I would suggest No. So I want to start the rest of this lesson by saying this.

Unknown Speaker  15:15
If you have never seriously contemplated the amazing love that God has for us despite our sins, despite I sin, and I come to him and he says, I broken and contrite heart, I will not turn away. Well, what if my heart is broken and contrite 15 times a day, guess what God says, a broken and contrite heart, I will not turn away. If you have never realized how ridiculous God's love and mercy is, and I beg you to listen and heed, because when we do what we want to do instead of what God wants us to do, He comes to us, and he begs us and he pleads for us to be humble,

Unknown Speaker  16:10
and to search after him with a whole pure heart.

Unknown Speaker  16:17
So let's talk about a revolt against complacency. In the book of Revelation chapter two. There is a church that is described there. The church of Ephesus. Isn't that interesting? What happened in Acts 19. in Ephesus, they're burning the Christians are burning their books. Now look what's happened 40 years later. In Revelation chapter two, starting in verse one. The angel the church of Ephesus writes these things says he who holds the seven stars in his right hand, who walks in the midst of the seven golden lampstands I know your works, your labor, your patience, and you can't bear those who are evil. You've tested those who say they're apostles and are not and have found them liars. You have persevered and have patience and labored for my namesake, and have not become weary. Nevertheless, I have this against you what had happened.

Unknown Speaker  17:24
I left the first love.

Unknown Speaker  17:27
Remember verse five, therefore from where you have fallen? What's the next word? What is it?

Unknown Speaker  17:35
Repent. Repent,

Unknown Speaker  17:42
and do the first works or else I will come against you quickly and remove your lampstand from its place unless you repent. Let me make a correlation to you what is repentance? Literally, the word means to change your mind, doesn't it?

Unknown Speaker  18:00
How many of us, firsthand going up, have

Unknown Speaker  18:06
made a decision not to sin. And yet I find myself doing the exact same thing again, anybody other than me?

Unknown Speaker  18:17
Why? Because we made a decision and not

Unknown Speaker  18:21
a resolution See what I'm saying? Our flesh in our mind or war one another. With our flesh, we sometimes do things we are not. And then we're sorry about it. But that sorry, has got to move us to resolve never to do it again.

Unknown Speaker  18:54
Not just decide to resolve i My opinion is not worth a whole lot.

Unknown Speaker  19:03
But I would suggest to you that mediocracy and complacency may be one of Satan's most sinister plans to

Unknown Speaker  19:15
to undo what God intended.

Unknown Speaker  19:21
We get in a place that's comfortable. That's not challenging. We remember in Matthew chapter 13. As a reference, you remember the Four Soils there. And we all know the four soils, the one that was the waste side and the rocky and then the thorny, and then the good. The first ones easy, isn't it? It's the way you saw the the God's word is thrown out. A person hears it and the devil takes it away. That person never becomes a Christian. Here's the interesting thing. The next three soils are Christians. aren't they? They are. Because at the rocky soil, what does he say? That they hear the word and they receive it. But in difficult times, they fall away because they have no what? Route? They're not anchored. What would that mean today, somebody becomes a Christian. And then they go through some hard times.

Unknown Speaker  20:30
And then they just give it up.

Unknown Speaker  20:34
The next one is the thorny soil. So they receive the word and it begins to grow. And I'm afraid that if we are not careful, we'll find ourselves as the thorny soil that it says that the cares of this world and the deceitfulness of riches, what does it do? chokes out the word. We're going to talk about this in just a second. So I want you to put a peg in your mind right there, cares of this world, and the deceitfulness of riches, chokes it out. It's not that the person isn't a Christian, it's not that they're not coming to church.

Unknown Speaker  21:25
It's that

Unknown Speaker  21:27
their life is ineffective for the Lord. Everything else is taking first place. This person to authority soil has not made a resolution in their life, that Jesus comes first, no matter what I would suggest to you not only personally, but even church was when you read the seven churches of Asia, five out of those seven churches have one thing in common. They were all told to repent. When was the last time you saw a church that repented that the leaders found themselves in a place where they said you know, we have not been doing what we should have been doing or we've been doing something wrong. Brethren, forgive us. We repent. We are so sorry, Lord, we want to be right with you.

Unknown Speaker  22:28
I've never seen it. I've heard of it. I've never seen it. We have got to be living

Unknown Speaker  22:38
and breathing God's Word and God's mission in our life every single day such things as like going into all the world. Is that a command? Or is that optional? Maybe even pray without ceasing. Some others we sometimes don't know what to do with frankly, visit the orphans and widows. Let's let's be frank about it. Is this talking the orphans and widows within the church? Who is this just orphans and widows? That's a good question. Whatever it is, we need to figure it out and start visiting, don't we? I mean, you could just go on and on loving and watching one another and caring for one another and bearing one another's burdens. And by the way, all of those intimate relationships, confessing your faults one to another. If you only get to know your brother in this building, you will not get to know them. Because we talk about the storm that just passed and how bad or good the Titans are doing. And if somebody is sick, are you feeling better? Now? We don't talk about the the intimate things, the the serious things, the most important things, how's the relationship with your spouse? How are you doing spiritually? What can I pray for in your life? What are you struggling with? We don't talk about those things we need to. And the only way to build those relationships is to go have coffee, and to have people over to your house and to get to know one another so that you feel comfortable confessing your sins, one to another. And frankly, just being more like Jesus, all these things are missions in our life.

Unknown Speaker  24:35
But they've got to be resolutions and not decisions.

Unknown Speaker  24:41
So what does this look like practically? Let's end here with a few practical applications that I hope you can take tomorrow with you at work and it'll help you to be the kind of man and woman God wants number one I would suggest and these are put in order that I thought to go in this order. Number one, begin to pray for God to lead your efforts, turn them into the book of Psalms, chapter five. Psalm chapter five, starting in verse one, give ear to my words, oh, Jehovah consider my meditation. give heed to the cry of my voice, my King and my God for to you I will pray my voice you shall hear in the morning, oh, Jehovah in the morning, I will direct it to you. And I will look up verse seven, please. But as for me, I will come into your house, in the multitude of your mercy. In fear of you, I will worship toward your holy temple, leave me, O Jehovah, in your righteousness because of my enemies. Make your way straight before my face. Brethren, if we are going to have a resolution revolution in our life, we've got to start with humbling ourselves and praying to God and begging his help, His mercy and His love. And did you catch?

Unknown Speaker  26:22
Let me see where it was.

Unknown Speaker  26:25
Verse seven, but as for me, I will come into your house, how in the multitude of Your Mercy, brethren every day, every moment you get to speak to God, it's because he allows sinful us into His holy presence.

Unknown Speaker  26:53
Thank you, Lord for that

Unknown Speaker  26:56
every single moment, number two, I would suggest that you clear out your extra curricular schedule, let

Unknown Speaker  27:06
me suggest this to you.

Unknown Speaker  27:10
I want you to turn to First Kings chapter 19. But I want to connect this with the soil. The thorny soil because you remember the thorny soil, they become Christians, they received the word. And then the cares of this world and his sinfulness of riches. Let's say you got the deceitfulness of riches down, you're like, look, money, not a big deal. What about the cares of this world? I don't want you to raise your hands now. How many of how many if I asked you if you were if you considered yourself too busy.

Unknown Speaker  27:53
Raise your hands mentally. If you find yourself being too busy. The question is why? What's going on in your life?

Unknown Speaker  28:07
So often, brethren, we live in a country that's blessed beyond measure. And we get to enjoy so many wonderful things. And we want our kids to have better lives and better opportunities and such like that. I would suggest to you so often, we involve ourselves in our family in extracurricular activities that are not wrong, or sinful or bad or anything remotely. But they keep us so preoccupied that it is difficult to squeeze in God in His Word and His people. Let's do lunch. Oh, I you know, we got to take the kids here. Oh, let's do breakfast. Oh, I got to be able to work at 5am Oh, let's do this. Oh, I can.

Unknown Speaker  29:03
When can we?

Unknown Speaker  29:07
in First Kings, chapter 19. Elijah has just shown God's power on Mount Carmel. And he is fleeing from Jezebel. And he's in a cave. And God asked him, verse 11, and says, go out and stand on the mountain before Jehovah and behold the Lord passed by. And a great and strong wind tore into the mountains and broke the rocks in pieces before Jehovah.

Unknown Speaker  29:46
But what what to say?

Unknown Speaker  29:52
He wasn't in the wind. And then God showed a mighty earthquake, but what If he wasn't in the earthquake, and then fire and God was still not in the fire, listen to what God is showing him all these amazing things. But watch

Unknown Speaker  30:15
what happens

Unknown Speaker  30:17
in verse 12, after the earthquake fire, but Jehovah was not in the fire and after the fire,

Unknown Speaker  30:23
what? Still Small Voice

Unknown Speaker  30:33
Why did the fire, the earthquake, and the when not bow Elijah to his knees, there is something

Unknown Speaker  30:45
about still and quiet.

Unknown Speaker  30:51
That seems to be precious to the Lord. So it says in verse 13, when Elijah heard it, he wrapped his face and his mantle, went out and stood at the entrance of the cave. It was when he heard that still small voice. I would suggest to you, brethren, that to get closer to God, to be able to read God's word, like you want to be able to pray like you want, you're going to have to make time

Unknown Speaker  31:27
every single day.

Unknown Speaker  31:30
Choose a time and stick to that time and spend time with God. If you don't, you will always struggle in your spiritual life. Because you're not making time every single day. Number three, be diligent to remind yourself of the most important things. Let's come back to the book of Psalms chapter 42, this time this morning, we were talking in our class about Jesus. And we were talking about the proverb or at least it was brought up as a man thinks what's the rest? So Izzy I hope you understand that when we talk about reading the Bible. It's not an exercise in obedience, you understand that? I hope you don't have this mentality of Oh, I gotta read my Bible today. gotta read my Bible, Okay, gotta get my gotta get my three chapters in. That may be a place to start. But it's not where you want to ultimately end up where you want to end up is, who is five in the morning, I can't wait to get up and read the Bible. That sounds weird, doesn't it? Especially to those people who are not morning people. You're like, I'm not even thinking about being up until eight o'clock. 10 o'clock. And by the way, it doesn't have to be in the morning your quiet time can be at night, middle of the day, anytime, any place that you can find some time to meditate. But as a man thinks so is he. The reason we God wants us to read the Bible to be in His Word is it reminds us of the things that are most important damping. Psalm chapter 42. We're not going to read all these because of time but Psalm chapter 42 As the deer pants for the water brooks, so pants my soul for you, oh God, My soul thirsts for God, the living God, when shall I come and appear before God?

Unknown Speaker  33:53
Is that how you feel?

Unknown Speaker  33:56
My soul pants. Any of you who are runners you understand any of you who have small children who have run after your children, you understand? You get out of breath, and you need to catch your breath. And he says here just like a deer who's been running and he needs to, to stop and to drink and desires that drink to be refreshed. My soul desires

Unknown Speaker  34:31
to know you better. Let me suggest to you that whatever decisions you need to make in your life

Unknown Speaker  34:45
if your first and foremost desire is to know God, to be close to God and do whatever it takes to be in that place every single day if that's your number one desire Any decision you make, will be tempered by that first woman. And so when you talk about situational difficulties, things that work things within the home decisions of how to interact with our spouse, or our children, or brethren or or whatever it is, we will temper all of those decisions with, what would God have me to do? How would he want me to live? How would he want me to spend my money? How would he want me to react? What would he want me to say? Or not say? So many of our decisions are much easier made. When our number one resolve is to know and to love, to cherish and to seek after God. The most important things

Unknown Speaker  36:00
for

Unknown Speaker  36:02
Ecclesiastes chapter four, please. And then we're almost done. Two more, please. Yes, these chapter four. I'm gonna suggest to you think God gives us brethren, not only to enjoy, fellowship together, but also to help one another. And I might say about this, this is something that, that we need to do start to get comfortable with. Anybody here like confessing your faults? You know, those things that you struggle with? I struggle with this, or I struggle with that anybody like telling people? No, we don't. Why? Because we guard those things, don't we? But I heard a quote, extra biblical that said, that we will struggle, always with the secrets that we keep in our life. When whatever secrets you have, rather than you need to find an outlet, it may not be here on the front row, it likely won't. But you need to find a friend, somebody, a brother, a sister, a spouse, somebody that you can talk openly with watch what he says here. Solomon says in Ecclesiastes, chapter four, verse nine, Two are better than one, because they have a good reward for their labor. And if one falls, the other one can lift them up. But woe to him who's alone when he falls, he has no one to help him up. It's not that you can't get up. He's just harder. He goes on to say again, if to lie down, though, keep warm, but how can one be warm alone, though one may be overpowered by another to can withstand him in a three fold cord is not quickly broken, broken, this is not talking about chords, or keeping warm when you're out in the wilderness. This is about helping one another. So whatever things that you need to do, to create that resolution revolution in your life, you verbally speak it, you write it down, you find a brother or sister that can hold you accountable. And you tell them, You call me every single day. And you ask me about this, please, I beg you. By the way. If you don't know that is the mantra in in a in a, that they have a buddy, a mentor, and what however many times they have to contact that person that is addicted to whatever, they contact them 235 10 times a day. So that they eventually go longer and longer and longer and longer without what they think they need. And they create that bond between one another.

Unknown Speaker  39:09
We would do well to learn

Unknown Speaker  39:13
how to open up to one or two people. And finally, I would suggest continue to pray. Continue to ask for guidance. Continue to listen and look for God. Paul says in Colossians chapter four, that we need to continue in prayer and be what you mean by remember that word.

Unknown Speaker  39:35
Be vigilant in it.

Unknown Speaker  39:40
Be vigilant in our prayers. How many of us would describe our prayer life?

Unknown Speaker  39:47
as vigilant as super awesome. As strong

Unknown Speaker  39:56
not in a hottie way I hope you do. And if we don't.

Unknown Speaker  40:03
And here's the beauty before we finish

Unknown Speaker  40:09
how many of you are completely convinced that God allows you turns at any moment in our life?

Unknown Speaker  40:16
At any

Unknown Speaker  40:21
moment, it's amazing how many things are just clicking to me that I think should have clicked 20 years ago?

Unknown Speaker  40:28
Why did it not click back then? I don't know. But I'm glad it did. Now. Those U turns a call to repentance. And when God's

Unknown Speaker  40:38
word strikes you, that you need to change, rather than listen to what the Spirit has to say. Listen to God, we get one chance in this life. That's all we get.

Unknown Speaker  40:56
One chance.

Unknown Speaker  40:59
We need to be sure that we're ready to meet Lord. Thank you so much. I appreciate your time. We're going to offer an invitation for anybody who needs to respond. I hope that you will think about where you stand with God. Maybe God's word has convicted you tonight. And there's something you need to tell this congregation. If that's the case, while we're singing the song, come to the front. The elders will talk with you will say what needs to be said. And your heart will no longer be heavy. And maybe you're not even a Christian yet. The first resolution you could make is to resolve to understand and follow every single day Jesus of Nazareth. God himself who claimed came in the flesh and died on a stinking cross. Because you and I want to do what we want to do sometimes

Unknown Speaker  42:13
he died and paid the price

Unknown Speaker  42:16
for you and me.

Unknown Speaker  42:17
And I hope that you would let that sink in.

Unknown Speaker  42:25
You if you're not a Christian, you need to be one tonight. You need to with a full resolve. Give your life over to the Lord. Allow him to rule and reign in your life every single day. I hope that you will not wait. If there's any way that we can help you come to the front and we'll serve you as we stand and sing the invitation. So
