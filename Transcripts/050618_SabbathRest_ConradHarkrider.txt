Have you ever Bibles and want to be turning to Deuteronomy chapter five

Conrad Harkrider  00:13
we have a very special guest in the audience this morning. Mom is here today. And boy, we put her through a lot growing up. She used to have a school upstairs to get ready for bed. And then she would come and check on the progress. And she always knew if you hadn't brushed your teeth. While I finally figured out that what she was doing was she was checking the the toothbrush to see if it was wet or not. And so we started wetting them down and then just going back into our rooms. But she eventually caught on to that one as well. But she gave us a lot. She gave us spankings and instruction and guidance, but what I'm most grateful for is what she passed down in terms of her faith. And so thank you, mom for all that you've done. And I wouldn't be who I am and the person I am today without you. All right, let's, let's get into the lesson. So when you think about things that can run for a very long time, NASA is constantly trying to improve their technology. And one of the things that they've been working on is the the space engines, the rockets, when you're trying to go very long distances in space, you have to have a thruster that can continue going. There's not a whole lot of gas stations, service stations up in outer space. So they have to develop things that can continue without need to refuel. And one of the tests that they did recently, there was this rocket, this this engine that was able to run for 48,000 continuous hours, that's about five and a half years. And there's lots of crazy science that went in behind that eye on charged particles and all these really cool things. But it's amazing, they can produce these things that run nonstop for long periods of time. You ever feel like your life is a deep space, ion charged engine. Like it just never stops. It just keeps going and going. We moved into a different house last year and after getting all of our stuff out of one place and into the next. We laid down in bed that night I told my wife I am exhausted. I'm exhausted, we have to have rest. Our bodies were not designed to just go and go. And if you stay up for 24 hours, you're starting to feel it. Not even that long of a time. Last week Curtis discuss discuss the idea of work and its importance. Our God given responsibility to how we see our labor. But this morning, I want us to think about the idea of rest. And this idea of Sabbath rest what God had given to his people, as one of the 10 commandments. Read with me in Deuteronomy, chapter five, beginning in verse 12, Deuteronomy five and verse 12. This is as Moses is recounting the 10 commandments to the people who had come out of the wilderness. And he says, observe the Sabbath day to keep it holy, as the Lord your God commanded you. Six days you shall labor and do all your work, but the seven day is the Sabbath of the Lord your God. In it, you shall do no work you shall you nor your son, or your daughter, nor your male servant, nor your female servant, nor your ox, nor your donkey, nor any of your cattle, nor your stranger who is within your gates, that your male servant and your female servant may rest as well as you. And remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt, and the Lord your God brought you out from there by a mighty hand and by an outstretched arm. Therefore the Lord your God commanded you to keep the Sabbath day. Did you know that

Conrad Harkrider  04:39
the longest command of the 10 commandments in terms of the number of words, the amount of ink that was spent on the command is this one that we just read the Sabbath? And it's interesting that God gives so much attention to this special day. Perhaps it was He wanted them to understand how this was to look. And so he goes through the different aspects of who was supposed to be resting and what they were supposed to be doing. But he also gives us some insight into why they were to do these things, the purpose behind it. The Sabbath was intended by God, first of all, to be a day of rest, an entire day of rest, not just a couple of hours, or a 20 minute break, that they would take throughout the course of their week. But they were to devote this entire day, to the Lord and to rest. This was a continual, perpetual thing every seventh day, the Sabbath day, every week, they were to give this to God, the word literally means to cease to do. And the model of this comes from God Himself. In Genesis chapter two, we're told about the the account of creation, how God formed the heavens in the earth and made everything that's in it in six days. And on the seventh day, he rested. It wasn't because God was tired from his work. But what we see instead is that his work was completed, it was finished, God looked around at his creation and saw indeed, that it was very good Genesis 131. Look at verse 14, what he says here in Deuteronomy five, he says, the seven day is the Sabbath of the Lord your God in it, you shall do no work. He emphasizes this idea of not doing any kind of labor or work. And that would involve no cooking, no building a fire, no work around the house, anything that was considered customary, or ordinary work they were to refrain from, I can imagine the Israelite moms looked forward to a day of rest, this divine mandated eat leftovers for the day. And this was something that God provided for them when they were in the wilderness. God was sending the manner to them, he would send a double portion, or they were to collect twice as much on the sixth day, so that on the seventh, they would have provisions, they wouldn't have to go out and gather. Because the Sabbath came every week. There was no doubt times when this was not a convenient thing for them to observe. During the plowing season, during the harvest, after someone had had a death in the family, there were times when it would have been difficult to take a full day out of their schedule and to rest. But yet, that's exactly what we find them doing. In Luke chapter 23. And verse 56. This is the women who had gone to the tomb, to see the body of Jesus and it says, Then they returned and prepared spices and ointments. On the Sabbath, they rested according to the commandment that Jesus is has just been his body, he's just been placed in the tomb, and they have brought these things to put on to prepare the body if there was ever a time to have an exception, right, an exemption from keeping the Sabbath. Wouldn't this have been it to anoint the body of the Son of God, and yet we find them still going back to their homes and observing or keeping this rest. God was serious about this. In fact, the penalty for breaking the Sabbath under the law was capital punishment.

Conrad Harkrider  08:43
If you remember in Numbers, chapter 15, there was a man who was found collecting stick, collecting sticks for presumably a fire on the on the Sabbath. And they brought him to Moses and Aaron and they consulted the Lord. And the Lord said, take him out and stone him for this. So very serious consequences for not observing this. But the Sabbath was more than just a time of rest and relaxation. It was also to be a time of reflection. Notice what he says in verse 12. He says, observe the Sabbath day, to keep it holy. This was a special day it was to be revered, and, and set apart. Also notice what he says in verse 14, he says, but the seventh day is the Sabbath of the Lord. This was not just a personal day for themselves. This was the Lord's day, the Sabbath of the Lord. They were to give this to God. In Leviticus chapter 23. Is God is laying out all the different feasts for the people at the very beginning of that list, when he's telling them about these holy convocations this Sacred assemblies that they were to observe. The very first observance that's mentioned in that chapter is the Sabbath. It was a day that was consecrated and sacred, like the other feasts. It wasn't just random occurrence. There were specific things that they were to be reflecting on remembering and thinking about. Their focus and attention was to be centered on the Lord, and why he had given them had given the nation that feasts. In verse 15, it says, and remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt, and the Lord your God brought you out from there by a mighty hand and by an outstretched arm, therefore, the Lord your God commanded you to keep the Sabbath day. You know, it wasn't just at Passover time that the children of Israel were to think about their deliverance from the land of Egypt. But every seventh day of the week, he says, I want you to remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt. They were oppressed, they were afflicted, they were under the bondage of Pharaoh, they were treated as worthless. You know what you do with something that is worthless. You throw it out, you discard it. And that's exactly what Pharaoh commanded to be done to the Hebrew baby boys, as they threw them into the Nile River, like garbage, that's the type of place where they were living where someone could just order a command, and all of the sudden, innocent children were being killed. Moses says, remember what it was like that now you have freedom, that you are no longer under the rule and terror of an oppressive King. God has brought you out he has rescued you. And he points out that this was not by their own power, or strength. Maybe they went from being slaves in Egypt, to a free nation without ever having to lift a sword or fight for themselves. And so they were to remember this great transformation, the blessings that God had given them. By keeping these blessings in the front of their minds, it would impact their view on their present and on their future where they were headed. And they were to do this on a weekly basis.

Conrad Harkrider  12:34
This was important because it shaped their awareness of who they were, and what God had done for them. The Sabbath was also intended to be a blessing, and a reward. Notice what verse 14 says, it says, but the seventh day, the Sabbath day of your Lord in it, you shall do no work. Your son, your daughter, your male servant, your female servant, your ox or donkey, your cattle, or your stranger, God list out all of these different groups. This rest was not just for the wealthy, it was not only for those who are powerful or influential, but the sons, the daughters, their servants, the foreigners, even the animals got a break on the seventh day. As slaves in Egypt, there was a good possibility that they were working seven days a week, making those breaks for all of pharaohs building projects. But the Sabbath was a gift. After they came out of bondage, God said, I want you to have this day so that you can rest. Think about a nationwide day off where no one is working. The markets are closed, people are out of the fields, everyone is basically doing the same thing. What an amazing thing that would be a time for family a time for community a time for rest and recharge. In the New Testament times people would often go to the synagogues on the Sabbath. And actually after 17, we're told about how Paul went to the Sabbath, three weeks in a row to reason to study to talk about the scriptures. So these are the types of blessings that they engaged in on this special day. It's also worth mentioning that the Sabbath is not something that we still observe today, just like circumcision and animal sacrifices, and keeping certain feasts and days we are no longer under that part of of God's law. The Hebrew writer makes the point that we have a better covenant. It's built on better promises. But although we don't formally observe the Sabbath, there's still so many things that are foreshadows to what we do have in Christ. And so I want to notice a few of those apples Questions for the rest of our time this morning. First of all, when we think about the Sabbath, it helps us to see the importance of rest. The value that God places upon this idea of rest. God built it into the 10 commandments, he insisted that his people take time away from their work. And Mark chapter six and verse 31. When Jesus was very busy with his ministry, it says, And he said to them, Come away by yourselves to a secluded place and rest for a while, for there were many people coming and going, and they did not even have time to eat. Jesus understood the importance of taking time away in order to be able to recover when things were extremely demanding and physically exhausting. And so it is for us that rest is vitally important. When we start to run our bodies to the max and don't take time away. That's when we start to get sick. Things start to break down and wear out. We get stressed, we show signs of anxiety, we get grouchy that happen to you, where you are just not as pleasant to be around when you haven't had your beauty sleep. You know, our families just like you need to go to bed, you need to take some time and get some sleep. And what about being around overtired kids,

Conrad Harkrider  16:29
anyone want to sign up to babysit some of those. I mean, they are a handful to deal with. They are more irritable, they're crying out, they're more dramatic, you know, everything is just a big deal. And oftentimes, as parents, we can get really frustrated when kids are acting that way. But who can blame them? I mean, well, we run them around from every place from here to there, and we keep them out late at night. And then we wonder why they are acting this way. Oftentimes the blame falls back on us. We live in a time when rest is such a rare commodity. We have so much on our plates, work, school, recreation, social activities, church, friends, traveling, we spend the entire day going about busying ourselves, from here to there. Think about the last time where you had a full day of rest and reflection devoted to God. Maybe you've had one of those recently, but have you stacked one upon the other week after week after week where it is a constant part of your routine? You see, we do quarterly or annual rest periods where we go on vacation, but do we build that into the fabric of our everyday lives? You see the problem with people who are overtired. And overstimulated and overworked is they have nothing left to give. They have nothing left to give in our relationships, we come home from work, we are dog tired from a long day, we don't have energy to give to our kids, to our spouses, for conversation for building those relationships. If I spend my weekend on sports and recreation and going from here to there, then it's no surprise that I come to worship and have a hard time staying awake. It always amazes me how we try to combat being tired. Instead of doing what our body would naturally want us to do, which is take time away. And to rest. We would do all sorts of things like filling up with caffeine and sugar and in all kinds of candy and treats just to keep ourselves going we drink the energy drinks, right just to get that get through that next period of time. When whatever ever around the holidays, my wife, if we ever have extra candy at the house, she'll send it to me, she'll send it to work with me. And it always amazes me that you can put a bag out in the break room at 7am and it has gone by 830 or 30. People are eating m&ms for breakfast. And isn't that what we do? We are just a constant flow of this junk food really, to try to keep ourselves going. Ephesians chapter five and verse 15 says look carefully then how you walk not as unwise but as wise making the best use of the time because the days are evil. Therefore do not be foolish but understand what the will of the Lord is. When we look at our schedules, are we being good stewards of our time and resources? Are we making the best use of our time? Sometimes that just means saying no, saying we can't commit to that, or we can't say yes, we can't do everything and be everywhere. We need time away for family, for prayer for meditation for refocusing on what's most important. Paul says, Don't be foolish. And running ourselves constantly on empty is not excitement, it is the recipe for burnout, we need to recognize the importance of rest. So let's say we do get some time scheduled, we carve it out, we block out our calendars. What are we supposed to be doing with that time,

Conrad Harkrider  20:45
the Sabbath reminds us of our need for reflection. This morning, in our Bible class, we talked about the promises of God, and how God has made us all given us all of these rich blessings. And we talked briefly about, well, how do we internalize these things? How do we get them into our hearts? How do we make it so this is something that is a part of who we are? I believe part of the answer to that is separating time out for rest, and reflection. That's what God's people did in the old law. They had a specific they had specific times of the week and throughout the year where they reflected and thought about what God had done for them. In Psalm 143, in verse five, here, David says, I remember the days of old, I meditate on all that you have done, I ponder the work of your hands, I stretch out my hands to you, My soul thirsts for you, like a parched land. David says that he remembers and meditates on all that God had done. That's what God intended for his people to be doing on the Sabbath day was to be reflecting to be thinking about all that he had done for them. And so as we think about ourselves, how often do we spend our free time thinking about what God has done for us? Oftentimes, I find my, my open hours, for being used for leisure, I watch what I want, I read what I want, I go shopping and buy the things that I want. And free time is really code for me time. It's centered on what I want, and desire. But how often do we spend that time focus on what God has done? What he has given to us? How often do we look inwardly and ponder where we've been, how far we've come what the direction that now we're now headed? We typically think about times of reflection around the first of the year, maybe a certain anniversary that the death of a loved one. But God wants us to have something that is more regular, an ongoing part, a weekly, consistent introspection into our lives. You know, in general, we are forgetful people. I was talking to a co worker recently, and he was he told me that his wife was expecting their third child. And so I asked him, Well, how much time is between your second and your third? And he said, it's about three years. He said, That's how long it takes to forget about what it's like to have a newborn in the house. And that's about right. You know, we go through these experiences, we have these things that happen to us. And it's just a couple of years, and it starts to the effect starts to wear off. And so as the people of God, are we constantly putting that at the front of our minds, reminding ourselves, look, this is where you were, this is where you were headed. And now look where God has brought you and where He's taking you. And I will say that thing that those types of thoughts, and intents don't happen by accident, we have to make intentional time we have to change our habits. And so maybe that means we're not listening to music, and in sports radio every time we get into the car, but instead turning on the Bible app reading or listening to a sermon. Instead of reading books on fiction, what about reading something that challenges us to grow as a spouse or as a parent? Instead of always thinking about

Conrad Harkrider  24:53
worldly things, watching TV being on Facebook looking at social media carving out that time to focus on God. When you compare us to Israel, we have so much to reflect on and be grateful for. God had taken them out of physical bondage. But He has delivered us from eternal spiritual death. God had shown mighty wonders in the land of Egypt, but he has raised up the Son of God and overcome and conquered death for all of mankind. He's displayed his power in his signs among us. And when we undervalue and under appreciate what we have in Christ, it leaves us in the same place that the Israelites found themselves in the wilderness, wandering and complaining. God had rained down bread from heaven, but yet even that wasn't enough. And so do we take time to count the endless spiritual and physical blessings, that God has overflowed what he has done for us, that's what rest should ultimately allow us to do is to focus on and reflect on what God has given us. And finally, the Sabbath was a foreshadowing of the eternal reward that God would offer in Christ. And Hebrews chapter four, in verse eight, it says, For if Joshua had given them rest, God would not have spoken of another day later on. So then there remains a Sabbath rest for the people of God. Rest here is talking about going into the land of Canaan, the security, the assurance, the peace that they would have. But ultimately, the land of Canaan could never provide those things. Because true rest can only be found in the life to come. So always we think about the reward, the rest that we should be longing for? Do you ever feel like you're tired? You're tired of fighting the constant battle of temptation, the daily struggle for purity for holiness for righteousness? Are you ever tired of seeing the effects of sin? We look around and watch families that get broken apart, we turn on the news. And we can't go a week without seeing some type of senseless act of violence, people taking the lives of others. Are you tired of living in this body? I remember go into my great grandfather's house, and I went into his bathroom. And I noticed that he had about 15 bottles of that arthritis relief cream. He was using that stuff like daily moisturizer. And for us, those of us who are younger, it's just it doesn't always connect but these bodies, they start to wear out. As the Ecclesiastes writer said, the keepers of the house begin to tremble and the strong men are bent low, our bodies are weak and flesh and they begin to break down. And so that all of those things should just lead us to anticipation for a time when God will provide true rest for his people. Jesus told His disciples that He was going to prepare a place for them, where we will go and be in the presence of God surrounded by his people, never to face the struggles and the toil and the work of this world. Revelation chapter 14 And verse 13, says, And I heard a voice from heaven saying, right this Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from now on. Blessed indeed says the Spirit that they may rest from their labors, for their deeds, follow them. God has promised a rest for those who are in Christ. That's what he offers. And if you're not a Christian this morning, we want to encourage you to think seriously about your standing and your relationship with Christ. Now is a perfect opportunity to make that step to begin your walk with the Lord if there's something that we can do to assist you or to encourage you in that path. Then we want to extend an invitation please come down to the front as we stand and seeing
