Good morning. Good to see everyone here today, and certainly a good day, you're probably aware of the fact that it is Mother's Day is the day when we typically look to our mothers and honor our mothers. Of course, that's not the responsibility here at church. We're not trying to have a Mother's Day service. But it is a biblical topic. And it's a worthy topic of our consideration. It's an interesting topic, also in our country. I know that this country has days for mothers, they also have days for fathers. And I think that's a good thing. Of course, that is a one day a year event. And it reminds us of something that we should be doing all of the time. But also say that this country has an interesting, interesting perspective when it comes to parents. Often when children leave the home, many people see that as the end of responsibility that one has to their parents. Some people think that the government is responsible for their parents. And some people simply feel that it's left up to only two health care professionals. And I realized that health care professionals may be needed, but some people say it's only their job and think that they can step away from the task. So I'd like to look at what the Bible has to say about honoring both fathers and mothers. I know it's Mother's Day, but I'm gonna include father's in this as well. I think the Bible makes a strong case for honoring fathers and mothers. We have many visitors here. And I want to just pause for a moment to extend our appreciation for the fact that you here, we want to welcome you here. Our goal at Broadmoor is to give God glory and praise and honor and all that we do both in this service and also as we leave here. So we invite you back in any chance that you have an opportunity. Open your Bibles, if you would, to Ephesians chapter five Ephesians chapter

Jeremy Sweets  02:12
five. So when we say the statement for honoring fathers and mothers, we see that Paul mentions this in Ephesians, chapter six, but it's in the context of Ephesians five, through chapter six, verse nine. And there we see Paul's instruction for the household for the household. And we see as chapter five, verse 21, concludes that concludes with this statement, submitting to one another out of reverence for Christ. He's going to show in the household how submission is important and necessary. And he starts with wives and chapter five, verse 22, Wives submit to your husbands, as to the Lord. Just as the church submits to God, we see that wives are to submit to their husbands, Husbands don't get off the hook is as well though here we see that Husbands are to submit their own desires for the well being of their wives, their to sacrifice of themselves, they are to love their wives and a self giving way, just as Christ loved the church and gave Himself up for her. In chapter six, we see instructions to children. Children, obey your parents in the Lord for this as right, Honor your father and mother. This is the first commandment with a promise that it may go well with you and that you may live long in the land. Here we see instructions to children, what children are to do, children are to obey. And in verse two, it says to honor your father and mother. You know, when I thought about what to talk about, here this this morning, I plan to talk about mothers but how to approach that. And this, this verse kept coming back to my attention. And I wondered how much I could get out of that phrase, Honor your father and mother and actually the Bible is filled with instruction. There's a lot of important instruction that's related to this command. So it is a small phrase, but I think it has a tremendous amount of meaning and practical importance for us as we consider this topic. Paul says children submit. He goes on to talk to fathers and verse four, and later to bond servants and masters in verses five through nine of chapter six but the the passage we want to focus on is in verses two and three, Honor your father and your mother. Paul quotes this and you may be familiar with If this but he quotes this from the 10 commandments. In Exodus chapter 20 And verse 12, we see that the fifth of the 10 commandments is to honor your father and mother, Honor your father and mother.

Jeremy Sweets  05:16
This quotation to honor father and mother comes from the 10 commandments, which really forms the basis of the entire covenant for Israel. The 10 commandments, unlike the rest of the law was spoken directly by God himself to the people. And he underscores the importance there of honoring father and mother. We also see that this command is repeated in Deuteronomy, chapter five and verse 16. To honor your father and mother, in Exodus 20, in verse 12, it says, Honor your father and mother, that your days may be long in the land that your Lord your God is giving to you. Paul instructs the people, they're the children of Israel, to honor your father and mother, it was the very basis of their civilization, their their, their covenant with God. You might notice in the first four commandments, that those commandments relate to one's relationship with God. And the first one of those 10 commandments, those first four, as you shall have no other gods before me. And we see that that stands as as something that drives the rest of the commands to not have graven images to remember the Sabbath day. But the the head of that is to have no other gods before me, God is the soul God. As he moves to commands five through 10, and the 10 commandments, we see that those relate to our responsibility to one another. And the first of those is Honor your father and mother, Honor your father and mother. The relationship, the honor that we would show to our parents relates and extends out to the honor and relationship we would have with all other people. If we cannot honor our parents, we will have a difficult time honoring others as well. If we cannot respect the authority and the position of our parents, we will have a hard time respecting that position and authority elsewhere. So Honor your father and mother. Well, let's look at some the meaning here of the word honor, what does it mean to honor Ephesians six, though, the word means to show high regard for to honor or to revere. In Exodus, which comes from Hebrew, the Hebrew word there in Exodus 20, verse 12, really has a broad range of meanings. And in some places, it's translated as to be heavy or weighty, or glorify. But here, it's almost universally translated as honor to honor, it is something that should be considered weighty or treated with importance. We also see that it carries the idea of recognizing a person's glory or dignity. And so he says, to honor your father, and mother.

Jeremy Sweets  08:22
So I'm sure there's many ways we could look at that word, what it means to honor but let me suggest three different ways that we can honor father and mother. The first one is to obey to obey. Paul, you'll notice in Ephesians, Chapter Six begins with that instruction, children obey your parents and the Lord for this as right. And then he moves to honor. I see honor is a larger category. If you've obeyed, I don't think you've covered everything that's necessary there. We sometimes make the distinction between obedience can be our outward actions, but honor is something that that goes internally and goes to an attitude. But if we are to truly honor our parents, we will obey them, we will obey them. Let me mention that as we talk about this lesson, it's got something for someone of every age. Normally when we talk, obedience, we're talking to children, those under the household. In fact, as we look at this idea of obey, we're going to see that there's a couple of limitations that may come with that. But the first thing is, obey, obey. As I mentioned, this is found in Ephesians, chapter six and verse one children obey your parents in the Lord, for this is right. Obedience is a good thing. Obedience pleases God and that's the language it uses in Colossians three in verse 20, a companion passage, children obey your parents in everything, for this pleases the Lord. The Booker Prize have herbs is filled with advice, wisdom, and wisdom begins at home. Wisdom begins by listening to and hearing the words of your parents. In Proverbs chapter six and verse 20. It says, My son, keep your father's commandment and forsake not your mother's teaching. Listen to them, obey them. And this is a needed lesson, isn't it? Children need to obey their parents. I mentioned there are a couple of limitations to this. In Ephesians, chapter six and verse one, it says children are too old to obey their parents in the Lord. If and child is instructed to do something contrary to God's will, they're no, they're under no obligation to obey that. Although you may realize that creates a very tricky situation, doesn't it? For someone that is under the authority of their parents, and it's likely as someone gets to the age of coming close to leaving home that they could even begin to make those kinds of decisions. Another limitation is what we see in Genesis chapter two. And that is, when, when a man when a boy grows up, and he marries someone else, he is told to leave his father and mother. And so he will leave the direction, he will leave the need to obey his parents no longer have the same kind of relationship and authority over him, he is to establish a new home and be the leader in his home as he is to cleave to his wife. Now, that certainly doesn't mean that from that point on, you begin to disregard everything that your parents say, but it does mean it's a changed relationship. And I think that we could even extend that to those that those children that leave their their parents house, may have heard the phrase, as a child may argue, or begin to say something and I know my dad would say something like this, as long as you're under my roof, then you you will do this or that, as long as he had that, that direction that guardianship of me, then I was expected to obey Him. And children are expected to do that. Although as I mentioned, I think this veers toward those younger, those younger. Well, the next way that honor is used, I think it is in respect, again, we might think of obedience is as involving our outward actions, but respect goes deeper than that. It addresses our hearts and our attitude. Children. It's so important that you obey your parents. But it's important how you obey your parents, obey your parents, in a sense, where you also show them respect, respect. And Leviticus chapter 19. And verse three, it uses a different word when talking about what is due to father and mother, every one of you and the ESV says, revere his mother and his father, the New American Standard says, to show reverence to and the NIV says to respect every one of you is to respect, show reverence to his mother and his father, and you shall keep my silence. I am the Lord your God. Children need to respect their parents. And this is often seen in the reverse or the negative and the law, those that this respected or Dishonored, and that often went with disobedience were to be punished. We see in Exodus chapter 21, and verse 15, that cursing your parents was prohibited. Two verses later in verse 17. It says that striking one's parents was seen as a severe case of disrespect and the fun. Both of those were punishable by death. That's how serious the infraction was. We also see in Deuteronomy, chapter 21, verses 18 through 21, that a stubborn and rebellious son should be brought before the elders of the city. And it says that the elders should stone him. Now, let me quickly point out that this is not a small child that disobeys on a single occasion. But it's rather a totally rebellious and defiant child who is of age to make decisions for for himself and we see that that was one when he brought him before the elders who said he's a glutton and a drunkard. So clearly, this is not a small child that they're talking about with a single infraction, but one that has come of age that is completely defiant. You see, God takes very seriously

Jeremy Sweets  14:59
the whole ohm, and the attitude that we would have in the home in Ezekiel 22 And verse seven is a kill list dishonouring parents among great sins of injustice. There he says father and mother are treated with contempt in you. The Sojourner suffers extortion. In your myths, the fatherless and the widow are wronged in you. You see, these are elements that really belong to what we might call common decency or a natural, a natural inclination of our hearts, we should not be taking advantage of those that are sojourners, we should not take advantage of the widow and the orphan. And in like manner, we should naturally show respect and honor to our father and our mother. You'll notice that while obedience belongs for the younger age, I think that respecting one's parents really has no age restriction. It is needed by younger children, middle aged children, and older children. And it can even be carried out after one's parents have passed away. We need to have respect for our parents. And you may get into the situation where just like government, there may be situations where you did not have a good or godly parent, there may be some situations where governments that rule over us may not be good or godly, but that does not detract from our our need to show respect. If for nothing else, the position that they held, they gave us life. The Jews often associated three people that gave life God, mother and father, and just as one was to show honor to God, there is a sense of honor that should go to those that gave us life. So we need to show respect to both our mother and our father to our parents. Third, I would suggest that we need to show financial support. Now I kid my kids every time they get $1 or two, I say good now you can take me out to lunch. Now you can take this out. This is not talking about younger children. And usually it's not needed or necessary for those that begin to leave the home. Or they're not put an age on this. But it's usually more when you're middle aged 40 to 60. As you're moving up as your parents begin to age, as they begin to need help more when their strength and vitality begins to leave them. They need financial support and and others support emotional support as well. And so support is needed in the New Testament often on or was often used in regards to financial support. And I think you can see this most clearly in First Timothy chapter five. Go ahead and open your Bibles to First Timothy chapter five.

Jeremy Sweets  18:15
And first, some of the chapter five and verse three, it says this, honor widows who are truly widows, honor widows who are truly widows, the context of this passage, what he's talking about when he says to honor is to put these widows on a list to receive financial support. And so when he says honor, it's almost the same thing as saying to give this financial support. And that's why there's some restrictions placed upon this, all widows would be worthy of honor and respect for their position and simply as people in for Christians, but here honor is reserved financial support is reserved for particular kinds of widows, those that were destitute that had no one else to provide that kind of support for them. Notice in verse four, it continues, First Timothy chapter five, but if a widow has children or grandchildren, let them first learn to show godliness to their own household and to make some return to their parents. For this is pleasing in the sight of God. The church is not to take the responsibility of supporting financially supporting one that has family why is that? Because family should already be doing that. Family should be honoring showing support for those that are elderly, particularly here for for widows well. Let them show that kind of support. In Verse eight says, But if anyone does not provide for his relatives, especially for the members of his own household, he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever. Even unbelievers, even unbelievers will hear at this time they would take their own family to themselves, they would show that kind of support. So if you refrain from if you shirk back from your responsibility towards your own parents or grandparents it says he, it says that you have denied the faith and are worse than an unbeliever. You'll notice in verse 16, for some of the five and verse 16. Here it says, If any believing woman has relatives who are widows, let her care for them. Let the church not be burned so that it may care for those who are truly widow of. And again, we see the importance here of those honoring or showing financial support to their own family, to their own family. And so when it comes to honoring included with that is financial support. And that's usually for those that are are older and able to do that. You'll notice in verse 17, it says let elders who rule well be considered worthy of double honor. Honor, again, the use of the word honor is used for financial support. And really, it's used in both ways, isn't it? In one sense, their due respect, and honor, but in another sense, if they devote themselves that double portion of that second portion of honor is financial support, which is made clear from the context as he talks about wages, and one is deserving of his wages. And so there is financial support. In this passage. I'll just quickly mention Mark chapter seven, verses nine through 13. You remember in First Timothy Five, Verse eight, it says, If anyone does not provide for his own relatives, he is worse than an unbeliever. There were at the time of Jesus Pharisees were saying that I'm not going to honor my father and mother through financial support, rather, I'm going to give that gift to God. And then I'm relieved of that responsibility. And Jesus condemned them for that many people at that time and even today tried to shirk the responsibility. But that's, that's not what Christians are to do. They're not to shirk the responsibility and financial support for their father and for their mother. One other quick use of honor y'all remember, when Jesus talks about paying taxes, he says, Honor to whom honor is due. And again, I think that that stands for that financial support there. So that's as I look at it, is what's included in honor, and there's I'm sure other things that that grow out of this. But those are the three things that that really captured my attention as I looked at this passage.

Jeremy Sweets  23:12
Honoring father and mother is extremely important. I don't have a lot of time to go over this fact, I have a whole section of this that I'm pretty much going to try to skim through real quickly, already mentioned that honoring father and mother is the first of the commandments in relationship to one another, in relationship to one another, it was extremely important. And I think that one treatment of their parents forms the basis for all other relationships in society. It stands at the head. And it's important, also mentioned that in Ephesians, six verses two and three, you'll notice that this command or this instruction is the first one with promise. And that goes back to again the 10 commandments where it states that it may go well with you and that you may live long in the land. Without going into a great amount of detail into this we often think that this means that one person will have a long life. And certain is even Gilbert mentioned in his class this morning, their bait may be a premature death from ignoring your parents instructions. But largely, I don't think this deals with individual long life. This is not the fountain of use, although some of those things may be associated with, again, long life listening to your parents instructions. But rather remember that the 10 commandments were given to the nation of Israel. It was a national relationship. And so God says that you may live long you may have long days in the land. Deuteronomy Chapter Four makes this clearest when he uses the same language to talk about obeying all of God's commands, obey all of God's command that you may live long in the land that I'm giving you Canaan. And if you go After idle is what it is he say, I'm going to pluck you up and remove you from the lane. And so he is talking in my mind more about a national promise to Israel for the presence in the Land. We might even extend this to talking about, really, again, this fabric of society is that relates to everything else. That's maybe the the analogy we could make for ourselves. But I don't see that so much as being an individual's long life as a wellness within God, and what he promises. It's extremely important. Okay, so what are some ways that we can honor parents? What are some practical things that we can do? In First Timothy, chapter four, five and verse four, children are told to make some return to their parents, did you notice the use of that language, there is a sense of giving back isn't their parents have done so much for us, and we all we all have them. And so we need to return to them, we need to give back we have an opportunity to show them appreciation, support, and even financial support for what a parent has provided.

Jeremy Sweets  26:21
And so I find that an interesting use of language paying back or giving return to them? Well, some ways that we can show return to them as to speak well of them, speak well of them to others. You know, in high school, when when children are beginning to assert their independence, there's often clashes that happen between parents and children. And often as a child is talking to their friends, they're they're bad mouthing their parents, I can't believe they won't let me do this. I can't believe they won't let me do that. We need to remember that parents are doing what they think is best for you. And so is what you want, and their desire to do what is best for you as those things clash, there can be confrontations can't be, you need to remember to have respect for your parents and speak well of them. And that's true as you're under the roof, so to speak. But that continues as we move out of the house, parents, and really all family in general, we have such a close relationship, we can show a tremendous amount of love. And people can also get easily annoyed. There's that closeness, where people begin to butt heads, they know someone so well. And it can be easy to be disrespectful in our language, speak well of your parents, appreciate them. Talk to others in a way that you show that you love and care for them. And really that's true for everything, isn't it? If you honor God, you speak well of him. If you love your children, to other people, you speak well of them. I know you may have some struggles, they may have issues, but you speak well of them. If you love your wife, you don't badmouth your wife to others, you speak well of them and your husband, you see how this really is important in many aspects of our relationships. Not only should we speak well of them to others, but we also need to express appreciation to our parents. Parents have Traimit invested a tremendous amount of time into raising their children. They've given up their energy and really, they've given their entire lives. You need to tell your parents that you are thankful for what they have done. You need to show appreciation for for the love that they have given to you. You need to sometimes point out that you taught me this, everything I know about this, I learned from you. And I appreciate that. You need to tell your mother you know mom, you pass down this recipe you always were good about cooking for us providing for us show words of appreciation, show words of appreciation. They'll go a long way. They'll go a long way. Parents are humans. I know for those that are younger, that's that's actually news. Parents are humans too. And they they want to feel the appreciation for what they've done. And so please do that. You also need to heed your parents instructions. I remember asking my mom often Mom What can I get you it's Mother's Day and she would always say something along the lines of this you can give me peace and quiet. Be kind to your brothers and sisters. No no not that you know what can I buy you I wanted that's how I thought showing appreciation to her was was showed I wanted to buy her I probably loved I thought gifts more than anything. So that's what What I wanted to give to her. But in actuality, what she wanted is for me to listen to what she has to say, you can honor your parents by listening to them by heating their instruction. It's important that you do that. In Proverbs 15, in verse 20, it says, A why Son makes a glad father, but a foolish man despises his mother, when you seek to do what is right, and listen to the instruction of your parents, it brings joy to their heart, it brings joy to your heart. That's true when you live under their roof. And it's true when you leave. There are many people when they begin to establish their independence, they say I don't need my parents instruction. I don't need my upbringing. I don't need their relationship with God. And many people turn their back on that. But listen to what they've had to say, let that guide you in life. And so do that even as you leave home, listen to what they had to say and have to say,

Jeremy Sweets  31:09
respect your parents age, respect your parents age, don't mock them for their limitations, or their inability, do not belittle them because of what they cannot do. And again, this can apply all through different facets of life as as parents are younger as they become older, but do not do not show disrespect for their age. But instead value them seek their advice. As parents get older, they learn things as well. And so cherish them and and do that in regards particularly to their age, show respect for your parents age. Forgive them for their shortcomings. Again, I hate to tell some of your younger people but your your parents are our people. They're not perfect. You know, when children grow up on a home, they begin to normalize everything. That means that whatever situation they're in, they think everybody experiences that. And that's just normal. If a child experiences abuse, sadly, they think that's what happens with everybody. And if they experience a good home, they think that's the way it always is. In fact, when someone leaves home and gets married, then they realize that wait a minute, my spouse doesn't do things the way my mom did, or you begin to see some differences that are there. And some of it's as simple as how you put out clothes, or you fold clothes, any number of things. But my point is, is that your parents are people and they're not perfect. They're not perfect. And so you need to be gracious with them. You can do that as you're under their roof. Be gracious with them, knowing that they will make mistakes, they will they will do things that they shouldn't do, they will treat you in a way that maybe they shouldn't be gracious to them. As parents get older. They you begin to realize more as you step into their roles, you begin to realize more and more that they were in the people. And they have shortcomings. And you need to instead of griping and complaining and nagging and saying you shouldn't do this, you need to be gracious, and kind show forgiveness. Our members talking to one man that was abused as a child. And his language was one of honor and respect. Even though he had a difficult childhood from his father. He emphasized the good things that his father did. He said he did teach me the gospel, even though he was twisted and how he lived that out. He taught me the gospel. He gave me life. He gave me many good things. And he understood that his father had failed in many ways, but he sought to extend graciousness and forgiveness. Now maybe that's an extreme case, but maybe that helps make the point. We are people parents are people and they need to be shown kindness, forgiveness, and love. We need to show parents love and support, love and support. Parents love their children. As children are growing up they they want the best for them. They seek the best they give of themselves so that their child can have there is this unconditional love that's supposed to be there with a parent and a child in first time The chapter for you remember the language that that is to be returned to the parents, especially as parents age and get older as they lose some of their vitality and their their strength, as they do no longer have the ability to do some of the things that they used to do. As they become more lonely in life. Many of their friends and acquaintances have passed away, their children have moved away. Many older people can feel as if I don't matter. Everyone has left me. You know, that's the way a child can feel, isn't it? They often as they navigate the world, they go to school, my friends don't like me, they begin to have doubts and things like that. Parents can feel alone. But they shouldn't as long as they have children. Children should show love and support for their parents, emotional supports. They should show

Jeremy Sweets  36:05
not just the friendship, but again, this emotional love and connection. You shouldn't have the attitude that my parent is a burden. You know, as you get older, and your parents get older, you have more than likely establish your own life, your own rhythm, your own responsibilities, whether that would be kids or your work or other things. And as your parents diminish in age, their need can become more and more and it's not always at an opportune time. In fact, it probably won't be as you filled your life with things. Never treat your parents like a burden. Never treat them that way. Treat them as one worthy of honor and respect, worthy of your time and attention. worthy of you sacrificing for them just as they did for you. Show them love and support, make them feel wanted. And loved, cherished, valued. I know I'm talking a little bit toward the older spectrum, but that's needed all throughout life isn't return love. Lastly, I would say support them financially. financially. Many people say that it's not my job, it's someone else's responsibility. It's someone else's job. And it may be there are some government programs or there are health care officials that that may help with that. But let us never think that we can turn over the responsibility of our parents completely to someone else. Let us never think that we can wipe our hands of the matter. You remember what it says in First Timothy chapter five, verse eight, even unbelievers will take care of their parents. And if you don't even do that you're worse than an unbeliever This is our faith in practice. This is our faith in practice, show support taking care of your parents, do the best you can with that. I know that finances are not endless money doesn't grow on trees. My dad taught me that. But show them support and the best way that you can in order to take care of them. And we also need to realize that when it comes to honoring our physical parents, it points us to the truth that we need to honor our Father who is in heaven as well. You'll notice in the 10 commandments, that honoring father and mother provides a transition from that relationship those commands to God to the rest of society. It's the first line of defense. You may also notice in the old law that some of the same instructions are given for God and for parents. Honor God. Honor your parents, it talks about the death penalty for cursing God and so it does for parents, there is a special relationship that one has to have to their parents and that points us to the relationship that we are to have with God. When we were younger, it's very hard to imagine or picture or even think about God, even as we get older his greatness and awesomeness and expanse is too much. But as we were younger, what is concrete and right before us are our parents and they help us point to obeying or living God. In Molokai chapter one, verses six through eight. There God says A son honors his father and a servant as master if I if I then am a father, where is my honor? And if I'm a master, where is my fear says the Lord of hosts to you, oh priests to despise my name and really through the rest of the chapter He goes on to talk about the five, that is their father, and master. God is certainly worthy of our honor and respect. He's worthy of our love and devotion. Maybe there's someone here this morning that's not living as they should. Maybe you're not a true child of God. You can become a child of God by believing the Gospel message repenting of your sins, committing your life to God, confessing that Jesus is the Christ and being baptized in the water for the forgiveness of your sins. What a great thing that is, you can be a child of God. You may be rejected by everyone else, but you can be a child of God. If you're here this morning and you're not living as you should, and you need to make corrections. You're a Christian and you need to make corrections. Please do what is right this very day. If there's any subject to the invitation, please come as we stand insane at this time.
