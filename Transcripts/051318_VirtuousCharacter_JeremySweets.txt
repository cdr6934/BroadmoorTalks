Good morning. I have a full house today. It's always a good day when we can come and worship our God. God has blessed us so richly. And it's good that we take time on a regular basis to be able to worship Him. So if you're visiting with us, we're glad that you're here with us. Our goal as a congregation here is to give God glory and honor and praise and all that we do. So we invite you this hours, we open up God's Word, we invite you to study with us. Let me make a quick mention as well that I was scheduled to preach last Sunday night and Jason shone Holtz preached for me stepped in. So I just want to mention that I do appreciate that he had a good lesson on resolve and commitment. So I commend that that to you, I was able to listen to it on the stream that we had. You'll never guess what today is? Do you know what day it is? I'm sure you do. It is Mother's Day, is Mother's Day. And so I'd like to talk about a lesson from from Proverbs 31. Proverbs 31. So go ahead and open your Bibles there. And we'll notice a few things about a virtuous character of virtuous character. Before we jump into the text, let me have a few introductory remarks. It is Mother's Day. As we come here, I already mentioned the fact that God is the one that we seek to glorify and give honor and praise to. But I do try to take advantage of times when the nation is thinking about biblical topics. I try to take advantage of that. And I will usually have a sermon related to Thanksgiving or father's or Mother's Day, when it comes to those days. Mothers should be honored for the tremendous work they do for the Lord, for their families and for the community. And personally, I have some great examples in my life between my grandmother, grandmother Halbrook, my mother in law, my mom and my wife, I've seen some great examples of mothers and we all need to be appreciative of those mothers. Secondly, I'm talking about proverbs 31. And I labored over my choice for the sermon topic this morning. This chapter is inspiring and worthy of our consideration. And while it certainly includes married mothers, I believe the text is not just for them, every Christian woman can learn and strive for the character found in this chapter. Not only that, I believe Christian men can learn from the character to have this worthy woman. And while Christian men may have different roles, there's still much to learn. So I hope that this lesson is not. So laser focus that it's only for a few people. I hope that this lesson is for everyone. Thirdly, let me mention that the last time I preached on the word the woman, Lisa Biewer, sorry to call you out. But Lisa bluer told me about how inadequate she feels. Hearing this lesson. And I will say that Lisa is not alone in that this is the ideal woman. This is the woman that can make you feel inadequate. Because most women, when they look at this text, don't feel like they live up. I know how she feels. I think in part Scripture calls us all to be something more. And there's always room for growth. There's not a single person on this earth that can say I've arrived, I've done everything the Bible demands on me there is room for growth. So I understand that Matthew, chapter five says Be perfect as your heavenly Father is perfect. That is our goal. That is what we are striving for. I felt much the same way and Trevor's class on the fruit of the Spirit. I felt like I didn't quite measure. Even my wife asked me when I told her about this sermon, she says you're not going to make us feel bad on Mother's Day, are you? I hope not that that is not my goal. That is certainly not what I'm trying to do. This chapter illustrates the ideal woman. So I would ask that you would be challenged while also being gracious with yourself. Be inspired without being guilt ridden for your imperfections. Allow this chapter to really set the direction of your life, to allow it to be something that you strive for. On the Day of Judgment, God will not

Jeremy Sweets  04:48
usher in only the perfect, but rather those who have sought him with their whole heart and I think that's what this chapter calls us to the seeking God with our whole heart. So I would ask that you would be gracious with yourselves. And if you feel too guilt ridden, Be gracious with the preacher when he picked this topic. When I look at Proverbs 31, I see a virtuous character, a virtuous character, allow me if you would to begin by simply reading the text. Proverbs 31 verses 10 through 31. An excellent wife who can find she is far more precious than jewels, the heart of her husband trusts in her and he will have no lack of gain. She does him good and not harm all the days of her life. She seeks wool and flax and works with wheeling hands. She is like the ships of the merchant she brings her food from afar. She rises wild as yet nine and provides food for her household and portions for maidens. She considers a field and buys it with the fruit of her hands and she plants a vineyard. She dresses herself with strength and makes her arm strong. She perceives that the merchandise is profitable. Her lamp does not go out at night. Verse 19. She puts her hands to the distaff and her hands hold the spindle. She opens her hands to the poor and reaches out her hands to the needy. She is not afraid of snow for household for all her household are closed and Scarlet. She makes bed coverings for herself. Her clothing is fine linen and purple. Her husband is known in the gates when he sits among the elders of the land. She makes linen garments and sells them. She delivers sashes to the merchant. strength and dignity are her clothing and she laughs at the time to come. She opens up her mouth with wisdom and the teaching of kindness is on her tongue. She looks well to the ways of her household and does not eat the bread of idleness. Her children rise up and call her blessing. Her husband also and he praises her. Many women have done excellently but you surpass them all. Charm is deceitful and beauty is vain. But a woman who fears the Lord is to be praised. Give her of the fruit of her hands and let her works. Praise her in the gates. What an excellent passage. It starts off with the very words and it wants us to consider an excellent wife. Often the arrangement in Hebrew sentence will put things at the very first that they want to emphasize. And so the very first words in this text is an excellent. Why for an excellent woman, an excellent woman. The word here relates to valor. And so it refers to really

Jeremy Sweets  07:45
a valor of character. It's even used of mighty warriors. And so you get the sense of the strength and courage of character that's spoken of here. And it says an excellent wife who can find she is far more precious than jewels. A woman that devotes herself to the Lord is of tremendous value. She far exceeds any monetary amount of money that we could have today are more precious than jewels, and it is her character that shines forth and shows that her her great value is found in her character. Notice a few things I've seen in her character I've picked seven from this text. First of all, she is faithful. She is faithful. I began with this one for a reason. We see many women that are busy today, many women that are workers today. But what makes the worthy woman so worthy is that she begins with faith in the Lord. You'll notice in verse 30, the next the last verse in this chapter, and also the book says, Charm is deceitful and beauty is vain, but a woman who fears the Lord is to be praised. She is faithful to the Lord. She's not emphasizing things like charm and outward beauty, but rather she is focused fervently on fearing the Lord. You will notice in Proverbs that the book begins and ends with this statement of fearing the Lord. For it says in Proverbs chapter one and verse seven, as it defines what wisdom is there it says, The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge. And here we have a conclusion to the book, don't we? That says that it is one that fears the Lord, that is to be praised. She is faithful to the Lord. And so this fear of the Lord this respect for God, this orientation on life in which we put God first is how wisdom is really framed in this book. From beginning to end, the worthy woman her life is marked by trust in God. Like Hannah, she pours her spirit out to God in prayer, in times of trouble, and in times of need, like Lydia, she delights in the word of the Lord. Like Esther, she trusts the Lord in the midst of turmoil and strife and is willing even to sacrifice herself. Like Lois and Eunice she teaches God's word to her children and grandchildren and those around like Priscilla, she is a student of the word and a teacher of the gospel to others. She works and she provides but she doesn't do this out of selfishness, but rather her work is an outgrowth of her complete trust in God. So the first thing I see and I think really the most important, what really pushes the rest of the character forward is faithfulness, faithfulness, we see that she is faithful first of all to go. Secondly, she is trustworthy, trustworthy. In verse 11, it says, the heart of her husband trust in her. And again in verse 12, she does him good and not harm all the days of her life. There's only two times in Scripture as far as I'm aware that this word trust is used for someone other than God. So this is a an amazing statement. In general, we're told to trust in God and no one else. But here, the term trust is used in a positive way. As it says the heart of her husband trust in her, it shows the great value that she has. She is trustworthy because of a consistency in her character. Because she has earned the trust of her husband, and others. She doesn't require micromanage, micromanaging from a husband or babysitting or anything like that she's capable, and she is trustworthy. And she's proven that by being faithful and consistent, and trustworthy in all of her actions, she has shown herself trustworthy in her marriage. The worthy woman gives her husband or no one else any reason to doubt that she is completely devoted to her husband. The text says that she does him good.

Jeremy Sweets  12:36
She seeks his good. She realizes that marriage is not a competition, where you're trying to outdo the other one. Well, maybe if you're trying to outdo in love and service, but it's not a competition where you're trying to elevate yourself above the other one, and she recognizes that she is trustworthy in her marriage. She is trustworthy. In her home. You see a woman here who provides in her home for her husband and for her children. And for those in the community. She is trustworthy. When it comes to finances, you see that she is full of business and that's quite necessary as she seeks to provide for her home and for her family and she is trustworthy. In all of these things. The text points as to the fact that a virtuous character includes and involves being trustworthy. Notice also that she is industrious. She is a diligent and hard worker. She is constantly working fine the text is I see it really could be divided into two parts. One of those is found in verses 13 through 18. And it has three lines and it repeats them twice. Often in Hebrew poetry and literature. Repetition is the key to make the point of emphasis. So notice in verse 13, it says she works with wheeling hands, verse 14, she trades and dimensions, the trade to enrich the table. And verse 15, she arises at night. Now it's going to take the three key words of hands, trading and night and it's going to repeat those again and the next three verses verses 16 through 18. Notice what it says there she can fit, considers a field and buys it and with the fruit of her hands. She plants a vineyard in verse 17. She dresses herself with strength and makes her arm strong. Here we see the idea of trade. And again in verse 18. It says she perceives that her merchandise is profitable, her lamp does not go out. At night. We see the emphasis upon her hands, her working hands as they engage in trade, and they work at all hours of the day, hands is a prominent theme throughout this entire passage we see it often may run down not only in verses 13 and 16. It talks about her working with her willing hands and planting a vineyard with her hands. But also in verse 19. She puts her hands to the distaff, and the spindle. hollered at Jessica, what is it the staff. It's related to the spindle it was a tool that was used in creating, creating garments and spindles and things like that. Little out of my depth there.

Jeremy Sweets  15:44
In verse 20, it says she opens her hands to the poor and needy. And in verse 31, she should be given the fruit of her hands, her hands are working hand. Her hands are loving pain. Her hands are caring hands, and her hands are always busy. There's also an emphasis on our interactions in busy business. It says in verse 14, that she is like the ships of the merchant. You see ships coming into the dock yard, coming and going, continuously bringing goods here and back and forth. And that's what the worthy woman is. She is like, ships of the merchant coming and going. And the text says that she brings her food from afar. Verse 16, she considers a field and buys it. And in verse 18, she perceives that her merchandise is profitable. All throughout the tech she is engaged in business in order to acquire what she needs. She uses her wit and her smarts and her her ability to be able to provide not only that we saw the third emphasis there is on night. Her schedule seems to have no beginning and no end. She's on call 100% of the time. She is always busy. She rises while it is yet nights and I take that to be the early morning while it's still dark out. She rises in verse 18. It says her lamp does not go out at night. The saying says from sunup to sundown, a warm, a woman's work is never done. And that's true. Someone once said that working mother is a redundant phrase, to be a mother is to be a work. And that is also true. And we can probably even extend that again. To all Christians. A working Christian is really a redundant phrase it is to be within the fiber, the very nature of our being who we are. We are to be workers, and we are to be workers for others. Here we see the word a woman is a worker, and she is a worker for other people. She's industrious, she's industries. Notice also that she is generous. She is generous in verse 20. It says that she opens her hands to the poor and reaches out her hands to the needy. Many who have an interest in money buying, selling and trading have fallen into the trap of being overly frugal spendthrifts and tight fisted but that does not describe the word of the woman. She is one that is thoroughly engaged in business buying, selling and trading but while the one where the woman engages in a lot of business, and deals with finances constantly, she is not a hoarder or tight fisted. But rather the text says that she is generous. She doesn't clench and hold on to what she has, but she opens her hand to those that are poor, those that are needy. Her heart goes out to other people. She has moved and she acts when she sees a knee. She gives and she gives generously. gives generously. That is a beautiful, beautiful picture. And we see the worthy woman is one who is generous. She's generous, as we've seen throughout here with her time, but also just reaching out to those that need help. The word the woman is generous. She is also wise she is wise and verse 26. It says that she opens her mouth with wisdom and the teaching of kindness is on her tongue. You know sometimes it's easy to get caught up in the mundane, but necessary tasks of life. The chore list at home never seems to end But notice here that the worthy woman considers more than just her her task list. The worthy woman also sees the value of other people, we saw that in the previous point with being generous to those that are in need. But she also takes the time it says to open her mouth and teach and give instruction. Out of all the things to be done in a home,

Jeremy Sweets  20:26
we see that she places a priority on people, on her children, on giving instruction. She doesn't fall into the trap here of Martha have just been a head down looking at the tasks, but it's the ability to hold your head up and see what is truly important. And so she teaches, she instructs, and she does it with wisdom. And I believe she does that because she sees the value in people, the value of her children. And she is one that teaches with wisdom. She is wise. You know it's funny, funny is probably not the right word, but characters in our society, present fathers as oath. Present mothers as may be lazy, laying on the couch eating bonbons all day, that that is so far from the picture of Scripture. She's not some foolish, ditzy woman, but she is wise. She is wise and she instructs others. The virtuous character of the worthy woman is wise and has a tremendous amount of wisdom. Notice also that she is strong, she is strong. In verse 17. It says she dresses herself with strength and makes her arms strong. And in verse 25, strength and dignity are her clothing. Again, we see a repetition here with this statement. You know, a busy worker can't help but build their muscles physically. And if you've ever had to tote around a toddler, he know that your arms get pretty strong having to do with that. If you've ever cared for an aging parents, you know that your hands, your muscles get strong in dealing with that. And so yes, you will build your muscles. But I don't think that's the primary point here of her strength. The primary point is that her strength resides in her character, and her steely determination to do what is right and to serve others. And her unwavering commitment to the Lord. Despite the circumstances, she will put God first and her character is strong. That's the opposite of the picture there have weaknesses in it. You see a strength here in the worldly woman, a determination, a strength of mind and character and focus and commitment. It's interesting as well that it uses the term of clothing to describe her she closed herself with strength and dignity. When the Bible talks about clothes for women, it doesn't focus on fashion, but it focuses on character on character. Let me tie this also with the next point and that is that she is beautiful. The word of the woman is beautiful. The beauty of the worthy woman is not merely external. She is not beautiful because of genetics. She's not beautiful because she's followed the trendiest diet or because she's had some kind of plastic surgery or because she's followed the latest fads on all those magazines you see when you walk through the the grocery store, but rather she is beauty. She is beautiful. And her true beauty is found in her character and her choices, not her genetics. We see in the New Testament it uses that language again of clothing and talks about the character in first Peter three verses three and four. It says your adornment must not be merely external braiding the hair and wearing gold jewelry or putting on dresses, but it let it be the hidden person in the heart with the imperishable quality of a gentle and quiet spirit, which is precious in the sight of God. Now you'll see in Proverbs 31 that she is busy clothing her family She's not scared it says of the snow because her family is well clothed, says that she dresses herself in purple and so clothing is a natural part of life. But you don't see an obsession here with her clothing, but rather have focus on her character. Dressing in a way that reveals our character is much, much more important than trying to show off the body. In fact, the body it says in the Bible and refers to the fact that that is reserved for the marriage relationship. And so when it comes to clothing, women should focus on showing off

Jeremy Sweets  25:24
their character. That should be what people see, dress shouldn't be so outrageous that the body is uncovered. But rather the character is the focus. We see also, as we go back to this thought of beautiful, and in verse 30, it says, Charm is deceitful and beauty is vain. But a woman who fears the Lord is to be praised. As we look at this passage, we see again, the beauty is in her heart, and her character, and her commitment. I'm certainly not going to say that our women, my wife are not outwardly beautiful. But again, I want to emphasize that the true beauty, our emphasis as Christians is on the heart and the character. Because you could be beautiful enough to be a model and not be pleasing to God because your heart is not right before him. And so our focus, our focus is on the character, and on the heart. These are seven characteristics that we see of the virtuous woman, I think it calls all of us to develop these things. Now for men, we might not use a beautiful character, but maybe we would. You can have a handsome character. How about that? Me add a few lessons as we look at this text and think about this. First of all, our theme this year is on faithful stewardship. And I can't help but notice that the godly woman is a steward to God. She is a servant of God. And she uses all of her gifts and her blessings to honor him. She serves him. She is a steward in the home. She is getting food, cooking, cleaning, making clothes she is teaching. The world today looked down upon a homemaker, but the Bible does not. There is a beauty involved in in the things involved with the home. She is a steward of her husband, she was given as a helpmeet. And she helps. The text says that she does him good. And she seeks his good. All of his days. She is a steward in the home and to her husband, and she is a steward of her children, whom she raises with godly instruction and discipline. She is a steward of her finances, as she uses her money to help her family, and to also extend to those that are needy, and she is generous, she is giving, she does not hoard it and say this is mine, mine mine, but rather she gives a worthy woman is a steward to God. Secondly, let me point out that a godly character is worthy of praise. In verse 28, and 29, it says Her children rise up and call her blessing, her husband also and he praises her. Many women have done excellently, but you surpass them all. And again in verse 31, give her of the fruit of her hands and let her works. Praise her in the gates. So do you express appreciation and encouragement to those in your life, those who have blessed you. Hopefully, it doesn't take a national holiday or you don't wait to do it once a year in order to express your love and appreciation. And that's true of mothers. But let me extend that beyond to others as well. To those that are a godly influence in your life, do you express your appreciation to them? It needs to be a regular part of our lives. It almost needs to gush out like a spring. We are so thankful. And let me also point out that sometimes those who worked so hard, may sometimes be running on fumes. And they could use the encouragement that we could provide. Sometimes it helps, maybe all the times it helps for mothers and wives, godly women of the Lord to be recognized for what they do. And so let us all extend appreciation on a regular basis to those we see with a godly character. Let me also add that I believe that the ideal woman of Proverbs 31 is a type of Christ. So She is the ideal woman. When we look to the New Testament we see Jesus Christ as the ideal man.

Jeremy Sweets  30:08
The word the woman is one that we see that is godly in her character, we see the same picture of Jesus Christ. He was sinless and without sin. In first Peter to in verse 22, it says, He committed no sin, and no deceit was found in his mouth, just as the worthy woman was a diligent worker in the kingdom of God. So Jesus Christ came preaching a message of the Kingdom of God, and teaching here on this earth, we see that the worthy woman was devoted to her husband, and to the Lord. The New Testament uses that picture of marriage, as an analogy to Jesus Christ in the church and Jesus Christ service to God. And we see that Jesus is one that served the church and gave himself up for the church. And he did that in service to God. He was a worker. Not only that, but we see that the motivation really is I look at the, the whole of Proverbs 31, her motivation, her heart, and her character is one that is sacrificial. It is one that is serving others and not serving. So Jesus Christ to lived a sacrificial life, completely giving himself in life, and in death. And Mark Ken in verse 45, it says, For even the Son of Man came not to be served, but to serve, and to give His life a ransom for many. And again, in Second Corinthians five and verse 21, says, He made Him who knew no sin to be sin on our behalf, so that we might become the righteousness of God. He did for us what we could not do for ourselves. I started the lesson with the point that this is the ideal picture of a worldly woman, and no woman today is going to be perfect. That's the same message we have when it comes to coming to Christ. Being a Christian is not about moral perfection. It's not about earning your way to heaven. It's not about God being indebted to you, because you've lived such a great life. We have all sinned in the presence of God Almighty, being a Christian is not about making it on your own, but about humbly submitting yourself to the King of kings. God has a plan, and has had a plan in which He gave His Son to die for being a Christian is not about inventing your own plan or going your own way. But about submitting yourself to God Almighty. Is there someone here this morning that's not a Christian? Have you given your life to God? You can do that by believing that Jesus is the Christ repenting of your sins and turning away from a lifestyle of sin to a lifestyle of service, confessing that Jesus is the Christ and being baptized in the water for the remission of your sin. If you're here this morning, and you are a Christian, and you're not living up to your commitments, then you need to make amends and make a change. You need to do that with with full conviction that now is the time to do it. If you need the prayers of the saints, the current of the congregation here we'd be happy to pray with you and for you. There's any subject to the invitation, please come as we stand and sing at this time.
