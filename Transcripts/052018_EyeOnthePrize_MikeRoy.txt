It's always a great privilege for us to come and worship our God in heaven. To give him the praise and the glory that is due His holy name, we are thankful for so many being with us today and trust that as we come together, we will seek to honor God to become more like Him as we fight the battles in our life that overcome the sin and failures that we sometimes have to deal with. We also of course, mindful at this time of people of South Texas were another mass shooting took place there, our hearts go out to those families, we pray for them, pray for our leadership in our country. And we remind ourselves though there's a sovereign God, who rules from Heaven over over all of creation. And we trust our God to fulfill His purposes on this earth as we recognize that one day will stand before Him in judgment. Yesterday, I was reading an article in the paper about the University of Tennessee's football coach, Jeremy Pruitt's strategy about recruiting. This was written by Joe Rexrode, I don't really know him, but the article was titled, eyes on the prize. And basically, I think he was suggesting that this coach Pruitt is reflecting a long term strategy that the building a strong team through recruiting, as opposed to the mindset of the fans who are saying, Coach, how many games we're going to win this fall. And he says, I'm not concerned how many games we're going to win this fall. I'm concerned about building a championship team. And so that phrase got my attention. And so I've chosen that for the title of my lesson this morning, eyes on the prize. This phrase really is and found in Scripture, a number of places we'll be looking at Philippians chapter three, this morning, we see this mindset manifested by Moses, in a book of Hebrews chapter 11, Moses had an his eyes were on the goal on the prize of eternal life with his father in heaven. And he was chapter 12, the writer admonishes each one of us to keep our eyes on the prize, doesn't he and when we take our eyes off the gold off the prize, that we can get discouraged and depressed or whatever might come our way. And so we we realized the importance of that. And so this morning, I want us to think about this concept of having our eyes on the prize fixing our eyes on Jesus wars, we sung the song looking to Jesus, looking to him from from day to day. And so I want to suggest to each of us that in the simple truth that we really find the scripture, that this can have a transforming impact on your life, when you practice fixing your eyes on Jesus. And when you visualize the prize of eternal life, that will help you overcome the trials and temptations that you face, and that we all face. And so we're going to be looking at three texts this morning. In the Bible, that we're most of us are fairly familiar with, as we seek to really to live transformed lives because of this type of principle. The first passage I want us to consider is flipping and chapter three, verses 12 through 14. Listen to what Paul's states over here, this happens to be the New International Version, most of them are very similar. He said this not that I have already obtained all of this, or have already arrived at my goal, but I press on to take hold of bet for which Christ Jesus took hold of me, brothers and sisters, I do not consider myself yet to have taken hold of it. But one thing I do, forgetting what is behind and straining toward what is ahead, I press on, toward the goal to win the prize for which God has called me heavenward. In Christ Jesus, I just want you to focus on that phrase. In verse 14, he said, I press on toward the goal to win the prize. And that was Paul's mindset, he was determined that he was going to win the prize of eternal glory. And the way that he would do that was by by pressing forward in his faith and not giving up. When discouragement came, when doubts creep into his mind, when persecution came his way he was not going to do that. And so if you think of this,

Mike Roy  04:21
this passage, there are a lot of lessons that I think Paul is teaching us. And I want to suggest that the this power that comes from visualizing a heavenly goal, and we need to keep that goal in the forefront of our minds. So in this context, in verse 11, he said his goal was to attain to the resurrection of the dead one day, the dead will rise, Jesus affirms that truth. So Paul says, I'm looking forward to that day, while he resurrected from the dead. He talks about sharing in the sufferings of Christ and all that type of thing. He's saying, basically, I haven't achieved that goal, he said have not already become perf But this what Paul said while he had had his eyes on the prize of heaven, He said, But I press on, I seek to take hold of I am straining toward what is ahead. Look at those those statements over there. These are verbs of action, straining and pressing and reaching forward and grabbing hold of eternal life. Paul told that to young Timothy, take hold of eternal life that God has given to you. So if and I'm suggesting that Paul had this fighting mindset, he was fighting the battle over sin and false teaching and all of that understanding, though, that the battle belongs to God. And he was pressing forward to that end. And so in verse 14, I liked the way the NIV states this. He said, I press on toward the goal, to win the prize for which God has called me heavenward in Christ Jesus, we need to ask ourselves the question, brethren, are we pressing forward? To win the prize, the eternal glory to be in God's presence? forevermore, I certainly am. And I trust that you are as well. And this was Paul's mindset, pressing forward to win the prize. And he could do that, because that was his goal. His goal was to be with God of Heaven, to overcome the discouragement to overcome persecution to overcome poverty, whatever he was dealing with, because he because his eyes were on the prize, he could, he could put up with all types of heartache and loss and all this type of thing, and ultimately, reach forward to the goal of eternal life. And first Corinthians chapter nine, I just want to jump in here for a minute before we come back to Philippians chapter three. Paul uses the imagery of an athlete fighting in a running a race. And he says, Don't you realize it in a race everyone runs but only one person gets the prize and look what he says during the last part of verse 24. So run to win. Are we running to win brethren, sometimes in sports, where we're playing basketball, team basketball, I'm playing tennis or if I play racquetball with Jesse, the goal is not to lose. In fact, for me, if I'm playing racquetball with Jess, my goal is not to get skunked in the game to get at least one point. Or if you're playing tennis, you don't want to get shut out six games to zero to love. So sometimes our goal is I don't want to lose. That's not Paul's goal. He said, run to win, run to win eternally. And so many times that I just don't want to lose. If you're running a race, some of us have run races in the past, I don't want to come in last place. At least if I don't come in last, I can save my faith. But Paul said, I run to win this way, a buffet my body, I discipline my body, I control what I eat, I control what I think about. And that's a challenge for all of us to do that. And so there's the reality. And Paul could run to win, to win the prize, because his mindset was on the goal of everlasting life, sometimes what we have to do brethren, in order to fix our eyes on Jesus to to keep our eyes on the goal, our eyes on the prize, sometimes what we have to do is kind of forget all of the failures and problems that we've experienced in our life. So you go back to our text over here, when Paul said, I haven't obtained this, and verse 13, I don't consider myself yet to have taken hold of that. But one thing I do, what did Paul do to help him keep his eye on the goal? Forgetting what is behind? You know, Paul had a lot to forget about in his life. He imprisoned Christians, he put Christians to death. I don't know if I can live with myself. If I did that, how did Paul live with himself

Mike Roy  09:00
to put that behind him, he repented of his sins, he trusted God's grace. But he said, if you're going to win the prize, if your eyes are on the prize, that means you better forget the past. And forget all your past failures, and struggles and shortcomings and all of that stuff. And we need to have the same mindset that Paul had. And so think about how, how true that is for all of us. So Paul had much to be had to forget. What about Peter? Peter is one of the greatest fossils. They're all faithful. Peter made a lot of blunders like me. But he denied Jesus flatly. I mean, you know, without pulling any punches, he flatly denied Jesus, how did you overcome that? Get it forget it could have put that behind him, which he did. And he went on to be a great servant of God. He made other blunders later, and the Galatian official pistol tell I was asked that he was giving preference to Jewish Christians and kind of living a keeping himself aloof from Gentile Christians. But all of us do that. And we have to we all of us fall short in some ways. And so sometimes we've got to forget what behind so the question for you this morning is, what do you have to forget? Maybe some point your life you stole something that you shouldn't have done, you told a terrible lie. Maybe as a young person, you committed fornication. That kind of can stay with you a long time, you still have to get over that and give that to God. Maybe in a moment of weakness, you got drunk, you lost your temper, you lashed out at somebody. Maybe at one point in your life, you fell away from the faith. That can happen to anybody. And so the point is, you look at the scriptures, and it's filled with men and women who were Bible heroes, but they struggled Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are all Bible heroes, but they all struggled. They all stumbled, and they went on to be great, faithful characters in God's kingdom. I liked the statement from Sir William Osler. He says, shout out all your past except that which will help you weather your tomorrows. So if you want to think about the past, think about your successes, think about periods of growth and purity and faith and evangelism. But don't don't be thinking about all the mistakes you made, all your failures, all your shortcomings, all your sins that we've all made in the past. And so we we recognize that. And so when you look at this text, and Philippians chapter three, we understand that Paul kept his eyes on the prize, even while he was in prison. And we remind ourselves that Philippians is a prison epistle, I believe in Paul's first Roman imprisonment. So Paul's writing from prison. I talked to my mom about this a lot and helping to encourage her to be faithful to God in spite of challenging circumstances. But Paul's writing from prison, what's the theme of Philippians

Mike Roy  12:08
Joy, I counted all joy, brethren, you know, everything's about rejoice, and Lord always again, I will say rejoice. So the book is all about joy, the Paul not have his difficulties, he had plenty of difficulties. In chapter four. He said, I don't speak in regard to need, says, For I've learned to be in whatever state I am to be content, I know how to be based. I know how to be how to abound, everywhere and in all things I've learned both to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to suffer need, I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me. He said, nevertheless, you have done well, that you shared in my distress or my affliction. So Paul faced those challenges. But he put the past behind him as he moved forward in his faith. Again, his goal was to win the prize of being with God forever in heaven. Couple other examples I wanted to look at the second one, from Hebrews chapter 11, with Tom about Moses, what a remarkable man Moses was, and think about his faith that he developed in the faith that his parents had. So in Hebrews chapter 11 and and verse 23, said, By faith Moses, when he was born, was hidden for three months by his parents, because they saw that he was a he saw that the child was beautiful, and they were not afraid of the kings eat it. By faith, Moses, when he was growing up, refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter, choosing rather to be mistreated with the people of God, tend to enjoy the fleeting pleasures of sin. He considered the reproach of Christ. You got to think about this. He considered the reproach of Christ, greater wealth than the treasures of Egypt. For he was looking, there's the phrase, he was looking to the reward. By faith, he left Egypt not being afraid of the anger of the king, for he endured as seeing him who is invisible. Again, you see a compelling passage over here talking about Moses faith. So he's raised basically in the palace of Pharaoh and had all types of opportunities, but his mindset, Moses, again, got to go along with this lesson. Moses eyes, were on the prize. And we keep our own. We keep our eyes on the goal of heaven. When I keep my eyes on the goal of heaven. I can do anything God wants me to do. Preach in difficult situations, teach the law of save souls. But when I take my eyes off the goal and look at my weaknesses, my fears, difficult circumstances, I can't do much of anything. But I can do anything when my eyes are on the goal. And the messages, fix our eyes on Jesus keep our eyes on that heavenly goal. And so looking at this text again, because Moses was looking to the reward is He refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's daughter, he could have grown up in the Egyptian heritage regal heritage in a palace. He said, No, I don't want to be an Egyptian son of an Egyptian king. That's not me. It says he chose ill treatment with the people of God, rather than the passing pleasures of sin. Wow. How did he do that? Because he wasn't looking at the women in the palace that he could have a sexual relationship with anytime he might want to. He was thinking of me thinking about God and heaven. He was thinking about the home that God had reserved for Him in heaven. And that was what was driving him. He chose the reproach of Christ, over all the treasures of Egypt. That's that's a challenge, especially if you have the opportunity have all the treasures of Egypt. But that means is he chose persecution, he chose to be ridiculed. He chose persecution, he chose hardship. Why? Because heavens worth it because Heaven was more valuable to him. And doing God's will was more valuable to him than anything else that he could receive in an Egyptian palace. Again, he left Egypt, not afraid of the wrath of the king. And so Moses kept his eyes on the prize, even in Egyptian Palace, one thing if we're struggling with poverty, or may be struggling just to pay the bills, and you get one bill after the other, and then you're wondering, how am I going to pay this bill and the you know, struggling to make ends meet? And then I can think about having like, Wow, no more bills in heaven. But if you're surrounded by gold and silver from floor to ceiling, that can be a distraction of all that. Well, he said, No, he said no to the wealth of Egypt, he said no to that wealthy palace that he could live in. Instead, he chose to suffer for Christ in His because, again, he had his eyes on the

Mike Roy  17:06
prize. Where are your eyes, on the prize of heaven, on the goal of heaven, or under struggles are on the wealth of this world. And so we need to recognize the power then that comes with maintaining that focus. Look at one of the passage, the third example that I want us to think about, and this is really an application for you and me, so the writer of Hebrews is addressing us ultimately, they first century Christians, there may be some Jewish converts. And this is what the writer says, to his listeners, they're facing trial, many of them were came from a Jewish background, they were tempted to go back to Judaism, being a Christian was hard, they were being persecuted. Sometimes their property was confiscated. Chapter 10. They lost their possessions. I mean, this is tough. And so therefore, the writer says, since we are surrounded by so great, a cloud of witnesses think about Abraham and Isaac, and Jacob and Daniel and everybody else, and Joseph, all the faithful servants of God. Since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, let us also lay aside every weight, and sin which clings so closely. And let us run with endurance the race that is set before us, looking to Jesus. And there's a phrase that we're focusing on looking to Jesus, a founder and perfecter of our faith, who for the joy that was set before Him, endured the cross, despising the shame, and is seated at the right hand of the throne of God. Consider him who endured from sinners such hostility against himself, so that you may not grow weary or fainthearted that we sometimes experienced the temptation to grow faint hearted maybe to give up and say, I'm not sure I can make it. And so this is a relevant passage for every Christian in this room, including myself. So I want you to think about this, what this is saying here. So with with our eyes on the prize, when we I think the numeric and standard version, universe toussis, fixing our eyes on Jesus, I want to suggest you that with our eyes, on the prize with our eyes on Jesus Christ, I can lay aside every weight that's holding me back in every sin. But when I take my eyes off, Jesus, when I take my eyes off the goal of heaven, then I give into temptation, I give into weakness, again, given to last a given to fear. I give you that all these things, but with our eyes on the prize, what he's telling us over here, we can lay aside these things that are holding us back and slowing us down. In this text also says that we can develop endurance to run the race. The Christian life is like a long distance race, and we need endurance and perseverance to do that. And sometimes and I think back is most of us we reminisce about our earlier days and my I've, in my practice now of jogging the other day I did, I don't think can't really call it jogging, but I went a few miles made it. But back in the day when I was in Okinawa, Japan, young man running races, you know, 10k 15k, half marathon, all that kind of stuff. Sometimes I would envision the goal line, and seeing myself crossed the finish line, sometimes I would see Jesus, like I'm running to win eternally. And that would that would propel me to endure and not give up. And so that's what the writer is saying over here, when our eyes are fixed on Jesus, then we're able to endure the cross the same way that he did. And the reality is, we were able to persevere, we developed that endurance, we were able to endure the cross. And we all saw Jesus had to physically endure the cross that he was carrying. But all of us have crosses to bear, don't we? Sometimes we forget that. We think that just certain people have those struggles. But we all have crosses that we have to bear in by fixing your eyes on Jesus, you can do that you can, you can bear up under that difficulty. Look at all that also, this phrase, this kind of got my attention when I was looking at this. Over here, so fix your eyes on Jesus to founder and perfecter of faith. He endured the cross and despising the shame. What does it mean Jesus going to the cross he despise the shame, and that he ultimately sat down, was seated at the right hand of the throne of God, the New Living Translation is helpful that sometimes can consult of the translations. The New Living Translation says he disregarded the shame. He dismissed the shame.

Mike Roy  21:50
The Good News Translation said this, that he thought nothing of the disgrace of dying on the cross. Now you could think about that for a moment. dying on the cross was the most horrific, painful way of death of any human being could experience most painful. It's also the most shameful, only criminals die. And across in that capacity, Jesus endured a level of humiliation that I've never been through, and you haven't as well. So if you have to deal with shame in your life, or mistakes, or whatever it may be, do what Jesus did, he dismissed it. Jesus dismissed all of the incredible humiliation and shame that he experienced in broad daylight prayer for the whole world. It meant nothing to him. That's an aha moment, brethren. When you think about how Jesus made it through that, because why his eyes were on the prize his eye, he knew that in a very short time, he was going to be reunited with his father in heaven, and he will have accomplished the goal by successive successfully dying on a cross and saving you and me from our sins. Wow. So what is it that so disturbing in your life? What difficulty what pain is that you're dealing with? What shame that you can't seem to get rid of Jesus looked at this, and he just dismissed it. I can't imagine that, in that situation. And so, again, this is such a compelling passage. So that that is the point over here that the battle over sin, or doubt, or shame or fear is one or lost in our minds, we win the battle in our minds. And it's not that Satan is so impressive and he tempts us and he's, he tries us and he does all of that kind of thing. But like Jesus, we win that battle. In our mind, I want you to again, look at verse three, which is still on the screen. So the writer says, Consider him who endured from sinners such hostility against himself so that she may not grow weary or faint, hundreds, faint hearted. So what does it mean when it says, Consider him that could just have you considered Jesus means think about him? Think about what he did think about how he lived. Think about how he faced temptation. Think about he think about how he faced discouragement and especially in terms of persecution and hardship. So what he's telling us as Christians today, he's telling us to think instead of thinking about me and my woes, and struggles and anxiety or difficulty or, or failures, think about him when you're going through pain, when you're going through heartache when you're going through suffering, think about him, don't be thinking about yourself. That's what he's telling us to do over here. And so basically, we would, we should say to ourselves, instead of thinking, you know, why me? Why am I so lonely? Why are my life so hot? ARD, why am I dealing with such suffering? Think, why not me? Am I exempt from human suffering and persecution? And Jesus says, if they persecuted me, they're going to persecute you. So instead of thinking, why, why me? Why not me? Why not think about what Jesus did for you. And for me? Again, it's a shift in our thinking. And so rather than we don't need to whine, or complain, or be moan, our situation, oh, Lord, my life is so hard. And that's not to minimize the struggles we all have him. But instead of thinking about you think about him. That's what he's saying in verse three, consider him. That's what he's saying, consider him, think about him. And don't spend all your time like I do some time thinking about me, and why am I dealing with this difficulty. And so it's a, it's a realization, that we can overcome the difficulties that we face mistreatment. If we have the same mindset of Jesus, one of the point I want to make before we wrap up the lesson this morning,

Mike Roy  26:09
keeping our eyes on the prize is actually not not easy. Because we get distracted, we get distracted by our failures, we get distracted by worldliness, we get distracted by materialism, we have family issues, we have health issues, and all types of issues. So how do we keep our eyes on the prize, and when our eyes are on the prize, we're ready to go. But then we can forget that. So number one, I think we need to read and meditate on God's Word on a daily basis. And I'm thankful that many of us here are engaged in some type of daily Bible reading schedule, understanding also, and I'm doing one now with my Bible app. And almost well accepted, I'm always a day behind, or two days behind. And when it gets longer than that, then I get buckled down. I gotta start reading my Bible or listening to my Bible. But the point is, making an effort to to stay on track, listen to God, we want him to listen to us through prayer. He wants us to listen to him through his words. So read His Word, meditate on it, on a daily basis. Pray what a wonderful blessing we have in prayer, right? That at any moment, with 7 billion people on the face of the earth, I can go to God and prayer and He listens to my concerns. And yours is amazing. But we serve an amazing God. But we need to keep our eyes focused on Him. We need to be regular in our worship and Bible class. We don't stress that, that this weed as a means of some type of ritual or some type of a legalistic mindset. It's important to be in worship, because this is what is pleasing to God. And this also changes you and me. And one of the points that I want to mention, and I didn't know how to say this, but find an accountability friend. So when thoughts of doubt, creep through your mind, and maybe discouragement, maybe you've gone through a period of depression, raise a red flag key get with somebody I said, Man, you know, Jerry, you need to I need to talk with you, man. But get that get that set up and have this accountability friend, that we can we all need. And we need to have that where we can share our struggles, whether it's the struggle with anger, or lust, or pride or whatever it may be? Or what about when it comes to the point of despair, we want to give up. This will help us keep our eyes on the prize. And so the question we leave this morning as we prepare to extend the invitation is the question for you and for me, Are your eyes on the prize? Are you thinking about your pain, think about your weaknesses. Think about your failures, your sorrows, your difficulties, we're challenged to keep our eyes on the prize. If you're not a Christian, then it's going to be you can't really keep your eye on the prize. To have your eyes really on the goal of heaven. You have to obey the will of God. You have to be born again. That means you have to believe that Jesus is the Messiah, you must be willing to repent of your sins, confess your faith in Him. And yes, you must be baptized and want to have all your sins washed away because that's what God said. It's still true today. As when Jesus said so many years ago maybe that you've done that. And you've got struggles reach out to the elders reach out to some of the preachers, one of the deacons whoever share your struggles it because we're here to help each other, do God's will and ultimately get to heaven. If you're here this morning need the want to come before the congregation and ask for the prayers of this congregation. We would invite you to come while we stand and sing this invitation song
