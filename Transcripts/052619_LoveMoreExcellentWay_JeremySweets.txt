Good evening. It's good to see everyone tonight. It's certainly been a good day. I didn't say a word I think we would have learned a lot. I didn't mention it this morning. But norm did an excellent job picking out songs that went along with the sermon and Kyle did the same thing tonight. Really appreciate bill to focus on the truths that we're going to be talking about in the sermon through song. So we learned a lot there. The Bible says we teach and admonish one another and edify one another in songs. And I think we have certainly done that today. I'd like to take a few moments tonight to really continue our study into First Corinthians chapter 13. You may have guessed that from the songs that were led, but we are going to be looking at first Corinthians chapter 13, a more excellent way, or more excellent way. Contrary to popular opinion, First Corinthians 13 is not a train script of Paul's

Jeremy Sweets  01:09
wedding ceremony. I know many people think that it's used in weddings a lot. And there's probably good reason for that. But what I want us to see and understand is that first Corinthians chapter 13, is in the middle of Paul's statement to the Corinthians about gifts. We see throughout the book that the book is dealing with divisions and problems that the Corinthians had, and Paul's instructing the church there to be united, to have the same mind to put divisions behind them to seek the way of Christ and follow after his example. And he see and Paul addresses many individual topics. One cluster or group of topics deals with worship. And we see he deals with worship when it comes to the covering, and submission in worship. And the first part of First Corinthians 11, the latter part of First Corinthians 11, he deals with the Lord's Supper. Many people at that time were taking a bunch of food for themselves while ignoring others. And they were ignoring really the very purpose of the Lord's Supper that they would do that together, remembering the body and sacrifice of Jesus Christ. As he moves to First Corinthians 12 through 14, this is the third subject that he deals with, and worshiping in this cluster. And he deals with spiritual gifts. There were many among this group that were apparently striving and bickering and fighting over being able to have one particular spiritual gift. And they were going to exercise that spiritual gift of speaking in tongues, even if it meant stepping on top of someone else that was speaking, even if it meant speaking in tongues where there was no interpreter. And so they had missed the very purpose of the spiritual gifts, which was to edify the church of God. And so we see that Paul has some very important instructions for them. We looked at first Corinthians chapter 12, this morning, where he talks about the fact that God is the source for all spiritual gifts and all spiritual gifts were given for a common purpose or goal. As we go throughout the text here, we see that that goal is to edify the church to instruct the church to teach the church. He goes on also to say that there is one body with many members, you're all baptized into one body. And so there's these two elements here of diversity, or a variety of backgrounds and different kinds of gifts that are there. But that is contrasted with the fact that there is one God, one source one goal, and we see that oneness all throughout First Corinthians chapter 12. So you may be asking yourself, well, what spiritual gifts should we be desiring? Which one do we want to have? Well, we don't have spiritual gifts today. That's not something that goes on. So does this passage apply to us whatsoever? I think absolutely, it does. And there's a lot that we can learn there. In fact, as Paul begins to instruct the church there about spiritual gifts, and about which one they should desire. He says, desire the higher gifts at the end of chapter 12 And verse 31, desire those things that would provide for for teaching. They all serve a purpose, but you need to understand that that teaching is the ultimate goal of the spiritual gifts. Now, there may be some other goals, some other practices as well as far as serving and things like that. But he seems to place an emphasis upon teaching. But then he says in verse 31, and I will show you a still more excellent way There's something more excellent than the demonstration of these particular spiritual gifts. And that's particularly important for a group that wanted to exercise these gifts as a badge of honor. They wanted to exercise these gifts as a way to bring attention to themselves or to say that I am more important than you because after all, I can speak in tongues and you can't. And Paul is going to say there is still a more excellent way. He does that, first of all, by looking at the necessity of love, the necessity of love. Notice in First Corinthians 13 And verse one. Here it says, If I speak in the tongues of men and of angels, but have not love, I am a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal, you remember that this is the very gift that they were all bickering about. This is the gift that they thought was the most important. And so Paul starts right there. He says, if you speak with the tongues of men and of angels, if you could speak the language of angels where they would understand, but you do not have love, he says, You're a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal

Jeremy Sweets  06:14
is not actually what they had become. In first Corinthians 14, you see that they were talking over one another, not taking their turn, they were speaking in such a way that there was no interpreter, what were they doing, they were making a lot of noise, weren't they, because they were practicing this without love without concern for benefiting others, and building others up. Love was out of the equation, it was a focus on self. And so he says, if you speak these tongues, but you do not have love, you are simply making noise, what an indictment, after all, and the first part of chapter 12, he says, I want you to understand about spiritual gifts they thought they understood. And here again, he says that you're making a bunch of noise. If you're leaving out love, love is absolutely necessary. He goes on in verse two to include other spiritual gifts that they would have had, he says, If I prophesy or if I have prophetic powers, and understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but have not love, I am nothing. Prior to think about great demonstrations of the Christian faith, these items would come on the list, a person of great faith, a prophet that would speak for the Word of God, one that knows the word of God. And I think that even in this passage, it's a special level, those that would be gifted by the spirit in some way with these things. And so he says that if you can do all of these things, but you do not have love, notice when it says, I am nothing. They wanted these gifts, so that they could say I am something, I am somebody, I'm somebody important. But here he says you can have all of these gifts, and use any one of these gifts to a great degree. But if you don't have love, you are nothing. You are nothing. He continues in verse three. And he says, if I give away all that I have and if I deliver up my body to be burned, but have not love, I gain nothing. Christ teaches that if we want to gain something, we must give up something. What greater degree of giving up could there be than what is mentioned in this past? Someone that will give up everything they have everything they own? Are you willing to do that? Is that something that you're jumping to do? Let me give away everything. He goes on to say not only giving up possessions, but what about your life? What if you were to give it up to be burned as a sacrifice as a as a martyr would. He says you can do that. But if you don't have love, you've gained nothing. Yeah ideas that we would give up everything in order to gain but he says there is no gain if you do that minus love. Paul makes a strong point doesn't mean love is necessary. It's not optional. It's not something that it's an add on you know when you buy a car, usually by the base and then you can add on if you want leather seats or you want this facet or this you know feature. Love is not like that where it's just something additional love is essential. Love is important. Love is needed. And so Paul makes that very clear in the first three verses. What about loves character? In verses four through seven he says love is patient, love is kind, and is not jealous. Love does not brag and is not arrogant, does not act on becomingly It does not seek its own, is not provoked, does not take into account a wrong suffered, does not rejoice in unrighteousness, but rejoices with the truth, bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things endures all things.

Jeremy Sweets  10:45
This passage is kind of a negative sandwich, isn't it? He starts off with two positive traits. Love is patient and kind. He ends with a positive trait. But everything in between there are eight that are mentioned there they are all negative Love is not something. And as I looked at this, there's really a couple of models for love. One is God isn't it? In First John chapter four, in verse eight, it says God is love. And so everything we know about God. When we look at love, if love is something God is that God is described as patient, isn't he and conned. In fact the cup runneth over when it talks about his characteristic. You can see his patience, his kindness throughout history, over and over again welcoming back the Israelites who had wandered away, welcoming back his people that have turned their back on him. God continues to be patient and kind even to this day, God rejoices in righteousness doesn't in truth. And God doesn't have any of those things in between. He does not brag. He's not arrogant, he would have the right to demand worship from everyone. But we see in Jesus Christ that He humbled Himself and came as a man. And you can take any one of those God doesn't rejoice and wrong. He doesn't rejoice and unrighteousness. And so we say God is the model here for what love is. And if you want to think about what love is, you can dwell and ponder God, and who he is. Another model that I hadn't realized before I came to this, Richard Hughes and his interpretation commentary made this point I thought it was very helpful. And that is the Corinthians themselves are a model for what not to do. If you look through these passages, or these words that talks about you're not to do this prior in the letter for many of these he's accused the Corinthians of doing the very thing that he says you are not to do. What is he saying? In your device of attitude, you are not acting with love. In pursuing self over others, you are not acting with love. So let's let's talk about this list and some of these things and keep those things in mind. Also, mission, a needed point, we make this point often, but it needs to be made often. And that is that as we go through this, this list and talk about these, we realize that love is an action. Love is something that you do. It's not just the feeling. And that's so important to note in our country, because we feel like you can be walking down the street and oops, you fell in love, right? And oops, you fell out of love. And I didn't even mean to I fell out of love. That's the American concept. And it's full with princess dresses, and happily ever after. And love is easy and grand, and all of that. But the Bible says love is a choice. It's a choice filled with action. And it's something that you make a commitment to do for another, not because of what you get out of it, because you are serving the other. So there's a lot here to look at. In fact, this was a difficult sermon to put together and not because I'm unfamiliar with what's in First Corinthians chapter 13. But trying to put words to really this important concept. I'm sure I'll do injustice to it, but we'll do our best. Love is patient. Love is long suffering, it suffers long love in years for another. It looks out for another love is patient. As I mentioned, God is described as patients. Why hasn't the world ended yet, because God has patience, waiting for those that are in sin to repent, God's patience is very clear he is long suffering, despite the many wrongs that have been committed against him, he is patient and long suffering, that long suffering will have an end, it will have an end, there will be an endpoint to his patience. But now he is waiting for eagerly wanting people to come to repentance. And so this word patience is one that would forbear one that would put up with continue in the face of wrong. Not only is God patient and love is patient, but love is kind.

Jeremy Sweets  15:47
It extends, goodness, goodwill, it extends. Kindness, that's a hard word to define isn't. You sometimes define that with what it's not, it's not ugly. It's not putting down. It's not focusing on self, but rather it is simply calm. And the Bible talks about for example, in Romans two inverse for invasions, one, the the kindness, the riches, the bounding kindness of God, and what she is patiently injured, and he has extended kindness to others. That's what love does. Love extends kindness to others. Doesn't mock, belittle, make fun of No, it's kind. It seeks what is good for the other. We also see that love is not jealous. Jealousy is a selfish desire. And it's when you want what others have. You see things in the world, you see a situation that someone else has, you're not happy for them. You want that and not then you're jealous. I would rather have that you see the focus immediately switches from others and kindness to self and jealousy. Paul says in first Corinthians three and verse three, for as long as there is jealousy and quarreling among you. Are you not of the flesh. Paul goes through this list of love. He's gonna say, Corinthians, listen up. You're not acting with love. You're not acting with love. Jealousy is a selfish emotion and love does not behave that way. It does not act with jealousy. It does not always turn the focus inward and say yes, but I want Yes, but I need. But it rejoices with others, that they can have something good. And it doesn't have to turn it inward in a selfish direction. He goes on to say that love does not brag. You know, this is one of the hardest things. I'm a competitive person. And growing up, I had to be taught over and over again, not to brag, I beat you. I'm laughing at you. Not only that, I beat you, but I'm gonna make sure you know it, right. And sometimes we don't grow out of that attitude. And we carry that into life. And we say Look at me. Look how great I am. I'm more than happy to put you down to make myself look good. But love doesn't do that. Love doesn't try to step upon the back of another to feel elevated. Love does just the opposite, doesn't it? Love does not brag in a way to push yourself up and push others down. Love is not arrogant, is not arrogant. Before we go there. Let me mention about this bragging. All throughout First Corinthians there's many occasions where Paul talks about boasting. In chapter one and verse 29, God shows the the spies things the world so that no one may boast in the presence of God. He goes on to say if anyone boasts let them boast in the Lord. chapter five and verse six, he says your boasting is not good. What were the Corinthians doing? They had failed to have love, didn't they? He goes on to say not only does it not brag, but it is not arrogant. You might see the word I believe the King James version uses the word puffed up, puffed up. You may have seen birds. When they're trying to mate, they puff up. Look at me. We do that. When we want others to look at us. We're puffed up, we're arrogant. We want people to know that we're something special. Again, it's a selfish desire and mode. Paul talks to the Corinthians about arrogance. In chapter four and verse six, verses 18 through 19, and five two, in chapter eight and verse one, he says, Knowledge puffs up. The Corinthians would say we have knowledge. But they weren't using their knowledge and service to others, where are they, in their knowledge, had puffed them up, made them arrogant, they lived without concern for others, because maybe they could say I'm right, or I have this knowledge or I know more.

Jeremy Sweets  20:29
But they had not lived with love. And with kindness and concern for others, you know, knowledge is so important. God has revealed His Word, He wants us to be a knowledgeable people, but it's not. It's not the only thing there is, it's not the end goal. It's not something that we seek to make ourselves proud or to make ourselves better than others. You see what I'm saying? Knowledge is not the end all be all. It must be used in service of what God would have us to do. And so you can't isolate it and say, I only want knowledge maybe that's what I'm trying to say. And so he says here, love does not brag and is not arrogant. It does not act unbecoming ly, we might think here of shameful behavior, something that was in decent. And while the word is not us, you can see the same kind of description when it comes to the sexual immorality of chapter five and chapter six, that is described there it was certainly shameful behavior are you might think of what would be described as the women that were prophesying, that would uncover their heads in a shameful way, or the humiliation of the poor during the Lord's Supper, those were all shameful behavior. Ever seen someone throw a temper tantrum? We've certainly seen kids do that. We've probably seen adults do that as well haven't. They're so concerned with themselves and getting what they want. They lose control. It's shameful to see someone act like that. People do that not only in a temper tantrum, but they do that in many, many other ways. Throwing away the commitment of marriage for adultery is shameful and shameful line trying to prosper over other people in with unjust game, a shameful we can go through the book of sins that really are shameful. And so love does not act on becomingly does not venture in to shamefulness in order to please self. Now love doesn't do that. Love is not unbecoming. Love does not seek its own. Paul references the same word when he talks about eating meat sacrifice to idols, he says do not seek your own advantage. But that of the other. He's trying to teach them about love and practicing love. And he says, when it comes to eating meats, you may have the rights. But that's not what is only important there. You also need to practice love with your brother, be concerned with your brother, make sure that they do not stumble. Love does not seek its own. Is there any great greater description of what Jesus did for us when he left the glory of heaven. And he came here and humbled himself as a man. He lived a lonely life in human terms. He didn't have money. He didn't have a home to speak of he he was not one with great nor notoriety. He came here as a servant and he did not seek his own. But what did he seek? He seek he sought what was good for us. He devoted himself to seeking what was good for us. That's love. He even died on the cross Philippians chapter two. That is love. Love does not seek its own love is concerned with others. Love is directed toward others not toward self.

Jeremy Sweets  24:47
Paul certainly would have indicted the Corinthians in the many times that they were seeking self love doesn't do that. He says love is not provoked and you might think here being provoked to anger, not easily provoked. Love is not looking for a fight. Love does not consider a wrong suffered. These two words really don't have references in First Corinthians, but you could imagine the kind of temper that would be associated with someone that seeking those themselves and their own way, they would be easily provoked to anger in order to get their own way. They would take notches take counts of wrongs suffered against them to use that in the argument in order to win. But love doesn't do that. Love is not easily provoked. Remember it is patient, long suffering. It does not consider a wrong suffer. It is seeking what is best you might think of the love that the Father had for the prodigal son did not take a wrong into account there. But he welcomed him back. He was not holding it over his head, well, you're back, but you'll never pay off this debt. That was not the attitude of the father, but he had love for the lost son. Love does not rejoice in unrighteousness, but rejoices with the truth. There are some people that see others doing right, and they despise them for that. And they rejoice when they have a downfall. They rejoice when they come into trouble. When they face difficulties. Many people like that spectacle, they rejoice and unrighteousness and think that's great. But love doesn't do that. Love doesn't rejoice when unrighteousness is found in others know about Love rejoices in righteousness and truth and doing what is good. That's certainly the heart of God, isn't it? God in no way, enjoys unrighteousness and he loves the truth and He loves when we seek those things. And so should we be, we should love righteousness and truth and hate evil. This tells us that love is not just about feeling good. You know, you can spare someone's feelings. If you fail to address truth, you can let them continue in sin. And you can both feel good and not have to be bothered. Now But love is concerned with truth and write love will involve confrontation of others in a loving gentle way of their sin. Because you care for them. You're willing to have some hurt feelings in order to help them out of their sin. And again, there's a right way to go about that. But Love rejoices in what is right. What is right. Not only that, but loves power should not be understated. It bears all things it believes all things hopes all things endures all things. Not gonna have you raise your hand but who can explain this one. The depth of what's involved here. It bears all things there are many people there are many things that people say they cannot bear. They cannot bear the weight of something. But love can bear that weight. Of all things love can bear that weight. Love believes all things. It has the site of belief, it is positive, it is not negative. Love looks forward to what can happen. Love hopes all things. Again, there is a positive outlook with love seeking what is best seeking what is good. Love is firmly entrenched with what is right and so it is on God's side. Love hopes and it hopes all things. There are many that fall into deep despair and a deep pit but love. Love sees a way out of that. Love hopes all things love endures all things. There are many difficulties in this life. But love can endure. Love can injure. Loves power should not be understated. So as we look at these aspects of love, again, loves character is is truly something that's important for us to see. It's certainly something that's needed. Love can be found in many different

Jeremy Sweets  29:50
areas of life canons. When we see love we often think about husbands and wives and certainly love is needed. There, there was a story by Oh, Oh Henry called The Gift of the Magi. I think I may have mentioned this before an illustration. But there you have a story about Jim and Della. They were poor, they were poppers. They were married together, but they, they didn't really have any money. So they decided to get one another a Christmas gift, but they had no money to do so. So Jim knew that della loved her hair, she had beautiful hair. So he saw her looking at some combs and brushes in the store one day, and he says, I'm going to get that for but he had no money. So he said, I'm gonna sell my watch my really only prized possession in order to buy those for her. She said really much of the same thing. She says, I don't have anything, how am I going to do this, guess what she sold, she sold her hair, in order to buy him a chain for his gold watch. Those two individuals loved one another, they were concerned with the other and wanted to do what was best for the other, even if they had to give up what was important to them. 1000 times over marriage is the practice of love of giving up what you want, and serving another. And that involves small things getting up to serve and to help supporting loving, maybe changing the direction that you want to go because you realize that this is what is needed for the marriage and for your spouse. Husbands and wives must love one another. And again, let me emphasize this is more than a feeling I believe probably feelings are involved and should be. But that's not where it starts or in. It starts with a commitment and continues with action. Love is needed in marriage. Far too many people say we've fallen out of love. We have irreconcilable differences, we've decided to simply go our own way. You know what, that marriage didn't make me happy any more. And so many people divorce and get out. That's the wrong view of marriage. Marriage is about serving and seeking the well being of the other, instead of seeking your own happiness. Whatever you think that means. Love is needed when it comes to parents and children. Love is changing a messy diaper. Not a lot of good feelings in that. But it's needed, isn't it? Love is is using kind words toward a child that just broke your favorite vase or your favorites, painting or whatever. Love is teaching and instructing. Love is spending time playing Go fish. That's not maybe really what you want to do. Love is being there for your teenager. Love is teaching. Love is forgiving your child. I have a friend from high school that said that his daughter was pregnant. And she was in high school and out of wedlock. And he says we're gonna love this child and support this child.

Jeremy Sweets  33:17
That's a hard thing to do it. And that would be hard. I think he had the right attitude. He didn't condone the sand, but what can he do but show love and support and we're going to do the right thing now, going forward. Love makes those decisions. And so we see love as needed when it comes to parents and children. There's one story I saw about a child that went up to his mom and said, Mom, I've got I've got this for you. I want you to see this. And he wrote down all the tasks that he had done, and he had a little bit of money out to the side. He said mow the yard, you know, $5 This is all an illustration, right? You'd have to get more than $5 today, but you know, he dusted and he had 50 cents, and he went through all the different chores and he says mom, you know, can you pay me this for what I've done for you. She turns it over and she says changing your dirty diapers, no charge, staying up with you while you're sick, no charge, praying for you. through difficult situations, no charge. And she goes through all the things that she had done and put no charge. And the child you realize he says, you know, this isn't a fair comparison. And the story goes that he wrote on there paid in full. He recognized that his mother had given to him over and over and over not because of what she would get out of it. Not because she would be compensated, but because she loved her child because you love your child. There is a point when those roles reverse isn't it when parents go up in age where they're no longer able to care for themselves. Anywhere child has an opportunity to extend love to their parents, taking care of them and providing for them. And hopefully, they'll simply say no charge. They do that because of love, not because of what they can get out of it. It's needed in parents and children, it's needed in the community. We live in a rough world where sin dominates, where a smile to someone can mean something, they might not have received any kindness, where kind words are important for people that feel hopeless, where we can let the light of the gospel shine, where we can point people to the love of God by showing them love ourselves. It's needed in our communities. Love is helping a neighbor that's tree has fallen down and broken through their fence. And going over there with a chainsaw and cutting to the love is taking food to the sick. Love is extending kindness to the poor, those that are ignored, those that society has deemed as the dregs or someone to be pushed to the side. Love shows kindness and care for them as well. It's needed in the community. And as this passage points out, love is needed in the church. How many fights have occurred because people had a complete lack of love. I think in part that's the point Paul was making. The divisions that were there were because they lacked love. They weren't self centered. We need to be a people that serve, not because we get noticed, or because we get thanked, because that's the right thing to do. We reach out to brothers with encouraging word with Sisters, we extend a helping hand. We ask people about their spiritual lives and how they're doing spiritual. And if we can pray for them, is there anything we can do for you, that's what we do with the church, we seek to help one another get to heaven. And this is not about us. It's about serving. In the worship, it's not about getting a pat on the back, but it's about making sure God is praised.

Jeremy Sweets  37:15
Love demands it. And it's needed in the church. And we have ample opportunity to extend love in those regards. There's a lot more we could say on these descriptions. But maybe that'll suffice for now. There's one more section in this chapter and that is talking about loves permanence, loves permanence. And verse eight, it says Love never fails. But if there are gifts of prophecy, they will be done away. If there are tongues, they will cease. If there is knowledge, it will be done away, for we know in part and we prophesy in part. But when the perfect comes, the partial will be done away. When I was a child, I used to speak like a child think like a child reason like a child. When I became a man I did away with childish things. For now we see in a mirror dimly, but then face to face. Now I know in part, but then I will know fully just as I have also been fully known. Notice the main point that he makes, and he makes it in the first few statements there. Love never fails, love endures. Love is permanent. You know, I think that the Corinthians seemed to think that if they could have this spiritual gift, then they would have this right relationship with God, or they could step into the spiritual realm in some way. And they would have these blessings. They would be able to approach God maybe unlike others could, they would be special in their relationship to God. But Paul actually extends his view of things beyond just the here and now. And he says really love is something that endures. There's a couple of different views for the temporary nature of these gifts when they will cease. Again, I mentioned I don't believe that we have the same types of gifts today. And so some people would say when the gospel has come about that that ended the need for these gifts. And so the perfect coming would be the the codified Bible that we have the end of Revelation there. Another view of this would be that it's referring to heaven. And when heaven comes the perfect combs, there will no longer be a need for this. And I don't know that I have all the answers to that. I do know he says one is eternal and the others are temporary. As far as when you find that temporariness there's some debate on that. And as I studied at this time, I think almost leaned toward the heaven view. Not that that would mean that we still have gifts today I think but his his point is that he's extending his view of things beyond the here and now. And one day, love will resolve. And the goal is to get there and heaven. He says in chapter 13, he uses two illustrations to talk about this temporary versus permanent state of things. He says in verse 11, when I was a child, I spoke like a child fought like a child reason like a child, but then I grew up, there was a need to go past those things. And so it is for these spiritual gifts. They're temporary, and they are needed for a time they were important for a time, but they were not the end all be all, there will come a time when they would no longer be needed, there is a time to grow up to the full purpose, to the full purpose. And verse 12. He says, For now we see in a mirror dimly, but then face to face at Corinth, as I understand it, they were a producer of mirrors. And so this illustration would have made sense to them. And he says, For I look in a mirror dimly, but then face to face, when you look at a mirror, and especially if you think back a few 1000 years, couple 1000 years, they didn't have mirrors quite like we do, where you can see everything clearly. In fact, that was probably more like my glasses. Half the time I'm like, it's awful, foggy in here. And really, the problem is my glasses have big smudges on him, I can't see out of them. Fact, you're all

Jeremy Sweets  41:29
difficult to make out right now. I got to put my glasses on in order to see fully. And so the mirror would have been smudge, we've been hard to see you wouldn't got an approximation by looking in that mirror. But it's much different than looking face to face. And so he says here that the temporary things are like that mirror that shows some kind of approximation. But it is the face to face. That is the end goal. And so he says love is permanent. But these things that you're spending all your time desiring, are actually temporary. They're actually temporary. In verse 13, he concludes. So now faith, hope and love abide these three, but the greatest of these is love. The greatest of these is love. This was an important lesson for the Corinthians important foundation or basis as they would consider spiritual gifts. And I think this is an important lesson for us today as well. We need to pursue love. And I doubt any of us could say we've reached the pinnacle of the love that we can extend to others. We need to grow more and more. Maybe there's someone here tonight that is not obeyed the gospel message. God loves you. God gave His Son for you. So that you might believe the gospel message, repent of your sins, confess Jesus is the Christ and be baptized in the water for the forgiveness of your sins. You put to death, the old man and your race to walk in newness of life. If you're here tonight and you are a Christian, God loves you. He wants to be with you and Heaven one day. So if you're not living right, if you're not honoring your commitment, you're living in sin and make that right tonight. You can come before us now and ask for the prayers of the congregation or you can grab an elder a brother or sister in Christ in private and say pray for me. I need Hill. There's any subject to the invitation. Please come as we stand and sing at this time.
