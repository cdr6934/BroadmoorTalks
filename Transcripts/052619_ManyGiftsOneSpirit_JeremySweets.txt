Good morning. It's good to see everyone here. Certainly good that we have an opportunity to be able to gather together mailable worship Aragon to be able to reflect on what is truly important. And I hope it helps focus us throughout the week as we leave this place. And it's it's always good to be here. You know, anytime you see an organization that is fractured or fighting, it seems odd. Normally, people rally around a common point are they come together for some club, whether it be history or their interest in whatever it would be. And so it's odd to see people that fight like that, you know, it's also odd to see the church fighting like that, or maybe I should say, especially odd to see the church fighting like that, because the church are people that have come together with a claim for holiness, for righteous living. Now, you and I know that once you become a Christian, you're not perfect. And that's part of the problem. And we're still all human, aren't we? And so Christians are not always what they claim to be. We're not always what we should be. But I'll say that the world takes notice when we are fighting the world takes notice when we seem fractured. Even the world has this expectation that that you should be united in what you're doing. You know, when I open up the book of Corinthians, I see a church that was fractured, a church that was fighting, like to spend just a few moments this morning, talking about the Bible reading texts that we had this morning, many gifts, and one Spirit, many gifts, but one spirits. You know, when I look at the book of Corinth, before we talk about this particular passage, let me just backup and give a little bit of background. That is when I see the problem at Corinth, I see the problem of division. In fact, Paul addresses this in the very first chapter, in chapter one and verse 10. He says, I appeal to you brothers, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you all agree that there be no divisions among you, but that you be united in the same mind and in the same judgment, that's what you are to be. That's what you should strive for. That is what you should be as the church. But notice, he says in verse 11, for it has been reported to me by Chloe's people that there is quarreling among you, my brothers, this, the the church at Corinth had fallen short of their goal, or their aim of being united together. And there was a lot of divisions, there are a lot of problems. And we see that Paul addresses many of those problems here in this letter. And you can see, he does that in many different ways. And he kind of hits different topics, there appears to be some prior correspondence, because he'll say, now, now we're referencing this question or this subject. And so he does that many different times. One of those blocks of issues that he deals with is worship. And he starts out in chapter 11, and verse two, as he talks about the covering. Now, some women were praying and prophesying, they seem to have cast off the symbol of their submission, the covering. And they said, their thought maybe that they don't need that anymore. They don't need that show or display of submission. And so they had cast that off, and that was causing some problems. We see in the end of chapter 11, with the Lord's Supper, that what they were actually doing was not the Lord's Supper, they were not actually partaking of the Lord's Supper, because they had twisted it away from God's intent. And so they were some of them were had an excess of food, while some of them did not. And so they saw that really more as a personal meal that they did every week. And so they made sure that they had theirs. And Paul reminds them to look to the very founding of the Lord's Supper and what that is based upon, based upon Jesus Christ and His sacrifice. Live like that. In your protecting the Lord suffer remembering Christ and His sacrifice. On chapters 12 through 14, which we begin to get into our text today. We see another issue with worship. There was a problem with spiritual gifts. This takes up three chapters, and we might divide it up into three different sections that Paul talks about, first of all, in chapter 12, which we'll be looking at this morning. We see that Paul Paul talks about it general

Jeremy Sweets  05:02
statements dealing with, with gifts. In chapter 13, he's going to move on to a more excellent way, something more that you should be looking for then the spiritual gifts or maybe within the spiritual gifts, something that's even greater. And it's not till chapter 14 That he begins to discuss the details of how they are to practice or to use the spiritual gifts. It's also interesting that it's really not till chapter 14, that you begin to see some of the problems that was going on with the spiritual gifts. And it appears that they had elevated the speaking of tongues as the primary gift that they wanted to have. Not only that, it was so important that anybody that could speak in a tongue should get up and do it right away. And so they were speaking over one another, there was no interpreter seemed to be chaos and confusion that was raining. And Paul is going to tell them and remind them that this is not the way that you're to worship, things have gotten twisted and turned upside down. So with that in mind, I'd like to look at first Corinthians chapter 12, many gifts, and one Spirit. Notice in the first three verses of chapter 12. Here he talks about the witness of the Spirit. Now concerning spiritual gifts, brothers, I do not want you to be uninformed. You know that when you were pagans, you were led astray to mute idols, however you were led. Therefore, I want you to understand that no one speaking in the Spirit of God ever says Jesus is accursed. And no one can say Jesus is Lord, except in the Holy Spirit. Again, he starts with this change of topic, he says, Now concerning spiritual gifts, and so he's going to address that. But notice what he says next, I do not want you to be uninformed, I do not want you to be ignorant of spiritual gifts. Now, we know from chapter one and verse seven, that they were not lacking in any gift. In fact, I think they would have saw this as quite a rebuke. They knew about spiritual gifts, they had spiritual gifts. And so why does Paul say I don't want you to be ignorant about it. Because just like the Lord's Supper, even though they had the form they were doing and carrying out and using spiritual gifts, they had missed the purpose. They had missed the intent. And so Paul says, Yes, I don't want you to be ignorant about spiritual gifts. And you might even note here, the English translation I'm using the ESV says Now concerning spiritual gifts, and, and this really says spiritual things. The word gifts is not found until verse four. But they interpret that as spiritual gifts, because that's the subject that seems to be in this section. So he says, I don't want you to be uninformed, and he's gonna go on and tell about the witness of the spirits. It says when you were pagans, and the word really is Gentiles when you were Gentiles. Just as an aside, it's interesting. They were still Gentiles weren't thing. But he says spiritually, you're no longer Gentiles, no longer Gentiles in the sense of doing the things that Gentiles do. And so he says, when you were Gentiles, what did you do? He says, You were land, you were led by what is false to mute items, and you were led astray. However, he says, You were led. Notice verse three, therefore, I want you to understand that no one's speaking in the Spirit of God ever says Jesus is a curse. They needed to know and understand that at one time, they had been led to idols. And what were idols were they were mute. They were dumb. They were powerless. They had nothing in them, but that is where they were headed. Those that followed after idolatry would look to Jesus Christ as those that said that he is the only way to salvation, and they would have said, that way as accursed. That way doesn't make any sense at all. We need to avoid that way. And

Jeremy Sweets  09:21
it's here that he says that didn't come from the Spirit of God. So what does come from the Spirit of God? No one can say Jesus is Lord, except in the Holy Spirit. What message to this? Does the spirit produce? the Lordship of Jesus Christ, Jesus is Lord that is the message that comes from God. Now if you're going to talk about error error can lead in many different directions candidates. It can be conflicting, it can have different answers and different approaches but truth has one true Truth. Truth has one statement, it is consistent within itself. And so we see that consistency here. If you're a speaking truth, this comes from God who is the source of truth, say God cannot lie. And that's one of the great things about truth is that it is consistent. It doesn't change with times, it doesn't change with nationalities, it doesn't change with the location where you are, it doesn't change with any of that truth is consistent, is consistent. My uncle, who is a preacher once told me that one of the best things that he did was to go overseas. And the reason he said that is because he can go to a different place, a different location where they had different customs, and see what truly was important, what was truth and what was not. You see, we kind of get into a way of doing things. And that's what we've seen. We get into an American style, whatever that is, and it's hard to move away. What is truly foundational from what is traditions that we have passed now. And so looking at a different location, you can see what is true, what is common, what is needed to pursue. You know, in the early church, they had that same mindset, as some divisions arose among the groups they asked the question, what is the same across locations, what is consistent, because truth is consistent. Paul says here, that if it comes from God, it is the statement Jesus is Lord. And if it says Jesus is a curse that did not come from God, truth is consistent. Not only is truth consistent, but notice the particular statement that comes from the Spirit. And that is Jesus is Lord, the Holy Spirit will reveal all truth. But it is this foundational truth that would be important for this group. Because they might have ascended to that they might have recognized, yes, Jesus is Lord. But the question is, is that really impacting your life? Is that how you are living? Are you honoring Jesus's Lord? You know, sometimes we can say, Yes, I believe in God, I believe Jesus is Lord. But when it gets down to the way that we're living our life, it can be absent, can it we can forget that yes, we're seeking to honor Jesus as Lord. And I think that's what they were doing at Corinth. And so he says, The Spirit produces this statement, the Lordship of Jesus, and that is the witness of the Spirit. And it is consistent in truth. And it relies upon the statement that Jesus is Lord. Let's move to the next section. In chapter 12, verses four through 11. Here he is going to talk about the gifts of the Spirit. In verse four, he says, Now there are varieties of gifts, but the same Spirit and there are varieties of service, but the same Lord, and there are varieties of activities, but it is the same God who empowers them all in everyone. First thing I might notice here is that what we're discussing, when we're talking about spiritual matters are gifts. Those things that are given

Jeremy Sweets  13:36
graciously, it's not something that's earned. It's not a badge to be warned to say, Look at me, I have this particular spiritual gift. So I am so great. That is not what's under discussion. This is a gift of God. And not only that, you see that there is one God, there's many gifts, he says, but the same Spirit. And he's gonna say this three times, you find that interesting, three times as he talks about the one God, and he talks about the ONE SPIRIT, the Holy Spirit, there are varieties of service, but the same Lord the Lord Jesus Christ, and there are a variety of activities, but it is the same God, God the Father, he mentioned each person of the Godhead, but he can refer to them as one. They are one, the spirit, the Son, and the Father. And there is one source for all of these gifts. The gifts may be different, but there's one source. There's one source, you see that particularly in verse six, it is the same God who empowers them all in every one. So if we trace what we're talking about here, if they're all come from God, then they'll all be consistent in that speaking the mess If truth one thing will all be consistent, not only do we see that there are many gifts and one God, they all have this common source of God, but they also have a common purpose. And verse seven, teach is given the manifestation of the Spirit, for the common good. The gifts that are under discussion here are not given to individuals for their benefits. The work that they are doing and carrying out these gifts of the Spirit is not for their individual benefit. Now they will benefit, but they will benefit as the group benefits, they'll get benefit as part of the group. And so here the goal is that all would be built up, all would be edified, and this is for the common good. Now he's going to go on to talk about what these gifts are. I don't see this necessarily as an exhaustive list. In fact, we have a few other lists where maybe some other gifts are mentioned. But he mentions the kinds of gifts that they would have noticed in verse eight. For the one is given through the Spirit, the utterance of wisdom, to another the utterance of knowledge according to the same spirit. As he begins to list the types of gifts that are at work among them, he's going to emphasize again, the point, these come from the same God, verse nine, To another faith by the same spirit to another gifts of healing by the one spirit to another, the working of miracles to another prophecy to another, the ability to distinguish between spirits, to another various kinds of tongues or another the interpretation of tongues, all these are empowered by the one and the same spirit who apportions to each one, individually as he will, as he will. So there is a common source with all of these gifts. And there is a common goal, they are to use them for the common good. They are to use them to proclaim the message that Jesus is, Lord, to proclaim the truth of God's Word. And so we see these gifts of the Spirit.

Jeremy Sweets  17:22
Well, as we move on, we see the analogy of the body. And this is one of the more popular parts of this passage, and rightfully so. It has a lot to teach us. But I hope that as we go through this, you'll kind of see that discussion in the context of what he's talking about with with spiritual gifts. And so as he talks about the analogy of the body, the body notice a couple of things. First of all, in verse 12, and 13, he sets the stage for what he's talking about. In verse 12, for just as the body is one, and has many members, and all the members of the body, though many are one body, so it is with Christ. He's going to compare the human body that we all know about, because we all have one, he's going to compare the human body to Christ. And just as the human body has many members, but as one body, so it is in Christ. There are many members in the church, but we are one church, one body of Christ. And so we see this oneness. He goes on to say in verse 13, for in one Spirit, we were all baptized into one body, Jews or Greeks, slaves are free, and all were made to drink of one spirit. Notice here that he says that all were baptized, everyone that's a part of the church has been baptized into Christ Jesus, and that is something that they share. They've buried or put to death, the old man, they've been raised to walk in newness of life. And they share that. They share what that proclaims their commitment to Jesus Christ. They share the commitment to put sin to death, and to live a godly life. They share that commitment, and everything that it means when one is bad times. But notice, again, he emphasizes, we share that one this but there's a lot of differences aren't there. There's Jews and Greeks. They're Slaves and free. And we could go on and on with this list or Can't We? There's differences in race. There's differences in nationality. There's differences, really, if you think about since the time was written in different time periods, different cultures, there's differences in our economic backgrounds, there's differences, differences, differences. But there is one body in Christ. You know, we should expect the body of Christ to look different among its members in terms of their backgrounds. We should expect that we should expect to interact with different kinds of people in the church, shouldn't we? Because the gospel calls everyone the gospel calls all the gospel does not distinguish. The Gospel does not say some are excluded, and some are included. The gospel is cast before everyone. And so we should expect there to be differences in the church, that is the place where we will work those out. But we'll work those out as one people will work those out with sharing something that is common to us all our commitment, our Lord, our baptism, we share those things. And so we see that all were baptized into one body. He's also going to say that every part is necessary. And I'll not go into great detail on the analogy of the body, because I know that this has been discussed before. But notice that he says that every part is necessary. In verse 14, he says, For the body does not consist of one member, but many, if the foot should say, because I am a hand, I do not have need of the body, or did not belong to body that would make it that would not make it any less a part of the body. You can't say because I'm not a certain kind of member of the body that I don't count. You can't say because I'm not doing something in the church like preaching or if I'm not an elder, I'm not doing this task, that I'm not a part of the church. You see, every part is needed. Every part is necessary. And so we can't look around us and say, I'm not like brother or sister so and so therefore I'm no good. You see, we often internalize, don't we, we often make the church about us.

Jeremy Sweets  21:54
We often say I'm not what I should be, I'm not a part. But we need to remember that we've all been baptized into Christ, we've all made that commitment. We all share Jesus as Lord, from the first to the last, every member of the body, we also see that every part is valued. We need to value ourselves as being a necessary part of the body. But we also need to look out at others and value them as well. In verses 21 through 26, the eye cannot say to the hand, I have no neither you nor again, the heads of the feet, I have no need on you. On the contrary, every part is needed. The parts of the body that seemed to be weaker are in dispensable. You see how he's beginning to address some of the problems that are there, as they began to elevate themselves because of what they were doing. Because of the gifts that they had. They begin to say I'm more important, they begin to focus on themselves in their service. Isn't it interesting that we can often be doing the right things, but yet be missing the point so greatly. We can be coming to church, we can be serving others, but it may not be the service that God wants, because it's from a twisted mind. It's from a selfish spirit. And so Paul addresses these Corinthians to tell them to correct their thinking, correct their thinking. No, no notice that he ends with gifts for the church and chapters 12 and chapter 12, verses 27 through 31. He reminds them now you are the body of Christ and individually members of it. He said that really at the beginning of each paragraph here in the last few verse 28. And God has appointed in the church first apostles second prophets, third, teachers, then miracles and gifts of healing, helping administrating various kinds of tongues. Are all apostles, Are all prophets? Are all teachers? Do all work? Miracles do all possess gifts of healing? Do you all speak with tongues Do all interpret, but earnestly desire the higher gifts and I will show you a still more excellent way. This list actually appears in Ephesians chapter four is there it talks about the body as well. But something that I guess I just looked over I hadn't noticed this in context, but he uses the word first, second and third here now is the undoing what he's talking about is the same well, some are actually more important. Now he's talking about functions here and he says first apostles, second prophets, third teachers, apostles were eyewitnesses of the Lord. And they went about proclaiming what they saw and heard in the resin corrected Christ, we see that prophets were those that spoke forth the Word of God, we see that teachers were then those that taught or instructed others about the word. And he says those were the first things that came first, second, and third. And he says, After that, then miracles, healing, helping administrating and various kinds of tongues. Do you notice what he mentioned last year, he mentioned last the very thing that they had wanted most various kinds of tongues. Now, this isn't saying that tongues are unimportant, but he's saying they serve a purpose. They serve a purpose. And you can imagine what that purpose was in case you're unfamiliar with it means to speak in tongues that would be to speak in another language. And as this gift of the Holy Spirit, it would be another language that you really had not studied. This is something that God had given you. And so that would be needed if there were people from that spoken other language in the group, so that they could hear in their own tongue just similar to what you might see in Acts chapter two, as they heard in their own language or tone. And so we can see the importance there. But that really takes place after all these things that he's mentioned this, this role of teaching, tongues fall in line with that, and teaching and instructing.

Jeremy Sweets  26:22
The goal is not to be able to speak in a tongue just for the just for the sake of it's cool. Or I'm important. Look what I can do. That's not the goal. The goal is teaching and instruction. God said, the text says that God has appointed these in the church, God has given these to the church. And we see that the first were the ones that we mentioned there. Not only that, but he says, desire, the higher gifts, look at what you're wanting, look at what is to come from this, what should come is instruction and edification, and he gets into that more in detail in chapter 14. But here, he says, to desire the higher gifts. There are many gifts, many differences, but one spirits and one God. You know, as I look at this passage, I'll notice in Ephesians, chapter four, we might notice the unity of the spirits in that passage. And it's interesting again, the unit of spirit is right after that comes the discussion of the body. And even that same list the appointment of those that were for the church that God had appointed in the church. And Ephesians chapter four verses one through three, it says this, are there for a prisoner for the Lord urge you to walk in a manner worthy of the calling to which you have been called, with all humility and gentleness, with patience, bearing with one another in love, eager to maintain the unity of the Spirit and the bond of peace. And what is the unity that we have the unity of the Spirit, the unity that comes from God, the unity that is consistent in its application, and it's search of truth here display of truth. He says in verses four through six, there is one body and one Spirit, just as you were called, in the one hope that belongs to your call, one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and Father of all, who is overall and through all and in all, there are seven items that are listed here, one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one body, one spirit, one hope, one father, all those are things that we can be united on. And we need to have an emphasis upon these things. Now, as we look at first Corinthians chapter 12, he really has a similar list, doesn't he? Do you notice that he mentions there is one in all of these, even within the diversity of the body in the diversity of the backgrounds that we have? There is one revelation, we might even talk about that as the faith, the revealed faith, there is one body of truth that comes from God. He says, there's one spirits that gives all of these gifts, all these gifts come from one Lord, all these gifts come from one God the Father. He gives the analogy of the one body, and he says, You were all baptized into the one body. And don't you know, I looked really hard for that hope in there. The point that Paul was trying to make, I don't think he was saying, let me grab this list and see if I can make application here and try to get each one of these. Now, these were a natural outgrowth. These are a natural product. These are natural elements from which we are united. So as Paul talked about unity, these things naturally come up. I think we need to focus on these ones. These rallying cries these points of unity. And as we focus on those together as a group will become more uniting, you know, our differences will dissolve. Our selfishness will take second place when it will serve in order to serve God and not ourselves. And that is the goal and the unity of the spirits. Well, let me close with a few lessons that we might learn from this text. First of all, Jesus is Lord, you are not. Jesus is Lord. He is Lord of all that means he is the one that sets the direction he is the one that deserves our devotion, he is the one that we give our lives to He is Master. We are not, you know, the problem that I see in Corinth is really that they had gotten this backwards. Don't you think that all the problems that happened at Corinth could have been avoided, if they would have understood this statement and lived it out? Don't you think all the problems that we have

Jeremy Sweets  31:08
in our families, all the friction that we have with even people in the world could be avoided? Maybe not everyone with people in the world, but majority of things could be avoided if we would learn this simple truth. Jesus is Lord, we are not. How many times have you seen the church that is claiming to follow God claiming to be a holy people claiming to be united in the gospel message? How often have you seen a church fractured, fighting? Divided? And how many times could that have been avoided? By recognizing Jesus's law? And the fact that we are not? We kind of resolved we're revolve around our own universe, or we think the universe revolves around us know, what I want is of utmost importance. You know, and I would like to speak in tongues, because, honestly, that does seem cool, doesn't it? But that's what I want. But they, they had carried forth that desire to the detriment of the Body of Christ, they had elevated themselves above the body of Christ, and in turn they had put Christ down. That's the problem with elevating yourself, isn't it? Someone's got to go. And we tend to push Christ down when we elevate ourselves. So let us learn the lesson that Paul was teaching the Corinthian Jesus is Lord, we are not. That is such a fundamental point. And we're struggling with it even today, aren't we? Let us prioritize God's mission. Just as we recognize Jesus as Lord, let us do the things that God wants us to do. He's going to talk about here and you see hints of this in chapter 12. And even more in chapter 13. And even more in chapter 14, that the spiritual gifts were given for the benefit of the group to build up and edify the group. It was not for their ego. You see, they were building up and edifying their ego, weren't they? And they sought to serve themselves. But what Paul says is you need to put what God wants as your highest priority of what you seek above anything else. Let us be busy, edifying the group, let us be busy working for the Lord, and not for ourselves. Let us prioritize what God wants to do instead of what we want to do. You know, when we begin to do that, I think a lot of those personality disputes and the fighting that we have can dissolve away, if we'll focus on what is truly important. Not only that, but we need to appreciate the church's diversity. And when I talk about diversity, I'm talking about the backgrounds that people have. I'm not suggesting in any way as some people might, that the church is the place where some people can say that Jesus is Lord. And some people can say that. I'm going to follow Buddha and maybe a mix of Christianity. The church is not a place for a different message. We saw that in chapter 12, verses one through three, you know, if it comes from God, it's gonna say Jesus is Lord. There's gonna be a consistent truth. Those fundamental things I think we should all agree on. There are other things that we're going to spend a lifetime trying to understand. We're not going to have a perfect knowledge and so there has to be some understanding with one another. But what is fundamental? What is fundamental should be known and agreed among us all There should be no dispute among that. And everything else we should be striving toward knowing all that God has revealed, working together with one another. So I'm not talking about the diversity of teaching. But I am talking about the diversity, the different backgrounds that we have, you know, I grew up in a certain way in a certain place and was taught by my parents to do what things a certain way, you were probably not taught those exact same things, a lot of those things really don't matter. But we seem to elevate those as the most important. We have different cultures, as far as what we place is important. Even in America, we are a melting pot, and there's differences among us. But we should appreciate that the church is a place where we should all be welcome.

Jeremy Sweets  35:50
And we should be welcoming to others. And instead of looking down upon another and say, You can't do what I can do, or you don't have the same background, that I have, instead of looking down upon others, being a foot that says the hand, I don't need you, or vice versa. Instead of doing that we need to appreciate, to love and value. This is the way that God designed the church and wants the church to be this is a place where you can grow. You know, if you simply fall in line and are around only those people that are like you, and you listen to the people that talk just like you. And that thing, just like you, and when it comes to meaningless backgrounds and things like that, you're not going to have as much opportunity to grow, the church is going to give you an opportunity to grow. Because you're going to be around people that are different, or you should be you should be, and we need to appreciate what is good and others. You know, I see this with personality types. Some people like to talk, some people like to get things done. You know, if I like to talk and you're kind of quieter, you know, I might look down on you what, why don't you like to talk? We need to appreciate those that are maybe focused on task and doing things and they can be a benefit in their personality type and vice versa. If I'm over here trying to get things done, and you're just talking all day, why aren't you getting things done, I can begin to look down, you see what I'm saying? That's just two points. But we are very judgmental, at least I am, can be. If you don't do it the way I think it should be done, then I'm going to look down on you. But we need to appreciate. See the value and others see that God has made them that way. It's very needed. We need talkers, and we need task oriented people in the church, don't we? And you could go through every personality type, we need them. God has made them and they are valuable, and they are needed in the church. Not only that, but we should seek the church's Unity, we should seek to be united together. And we will do that as we focus upon what brings us together. There's one Lord. There's one spirits, there's one father, there's one church, one body, we've all been baptized into Christ, we all share that, that experience and that commitment. And that forgiveness. That's something we all share. And as we focus on those things, and seek to take that very message to the world. I think we'll be united. That doesn't mean we won't have problems. You know, we're a different places of growth. And we'll all need to grow and continue to grow. But we need to seek the church's unity to be united together, let petty things fall by the wayside. Let what is important rise to the top. Seek the church's unity. That's my lesson. And that's my lesson. It may be that you're here this morning and you're not a Christian, you have an opportunity to become a part of the church by believing that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living God, confessing your sins and confessing that Jesus is the Christ, the one that came to forgive you of your sins, repenting of your sins, turning away from that and being baptized into Christ. When you've done that you've obeyed the gospel message. The Gospel message demands a response. And when you obey the gospel message, God adds you to His church, and you can begin to honor your commitment among others that have made that commitment. If you're here this morning, and you are a Christian, you're not living as you should. There's no time like today to make your life right. There's any subject to the invitation please come as we stand and sing at this time.
