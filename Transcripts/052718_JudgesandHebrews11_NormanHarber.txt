Well, Conrad left town and Jeremy left town, and Kurt left town, and Mike preach last week. So guess what? You've got me this morning, I hope that I have something that's beneficial to say this morning that God will be glorified. If you like me, and I don't assume that but if you're like me, you may have some passages in the Bible that you scratch your head about. And Hebrews chapter 11, we're familiar with that chapter, because we call it the, the chapter of faith or the hall of fame of faith. And we have characters such as Abraham, and Moses and Noah, and Joseph, and we would expect to find those names in a book about faith. We come to one particular verse, and that's in verse 32, first part of the verse and it says in what more shall I say, for time will fail me to tell of Gideon Bay rack Samson? Jeptha. Now, you may start to ask, why have these guys in this chapter, these guys who seem to have some less than desirable characteristics, who have some questionable things that they did in their lives? And if we're going to talk about judges, why did the writer of Hebrews pick these? Why not Deborah? Why not eat hood? Why not? Othniel? Who was a relative of Caleb? To be sure these that are listed do have some pretty famous things said about them? Famous things, famous stories that we're familiar with. But to answer this question, let's go back and, and think about judges. For a few minutes this morning. Judges is an unusual book in the Bible. Now many books do have violence, they contain violence, and I had a worship and disobedience to God. But this book, the book of Judges, takes it to a new level. And I might say a new low level. And sometimes sometimes it's uncomfortable to read parts of judges, because it's so low in its level that it stoops to. Now, there were a lot of popular stories that we're familiar with as kids, the life of Samson, and all the cool things that he did, and the killing of the lion, you have a left handed swordsman that's drawing a sword off his right thigh, you have a woman leader, you have a woman driving a tent peg through the head of a man, how cool is that? You have a band of 300 men that have only trumpets in one hand and a torch in another, and they defeat a huge army. And there's a whole lot of stories like that, that draw us as children anyway, to the book of Judges. But judges is really sad, and bad. Some of the worst stories of God's people are found in the book of Judges, there's blood, blood, and more blood. Violence permeates the book. Much of judges is a reversal of what Deuteronomy teaches. Some have said that judges is what not to do. In Deuteronomy, you have teachers against to teaching against idolatry and rebellion to God and making rash vows. And you have teaching again, against not doing what's right in your own eyes, it actually says that you have teaching again, against offering your children as sacrifices, it actually says that. And you find that and much more in the book of Judges, the people of Israel committing those acts. So what happened? If you remember, in the conquest of Canaan, they had a great leader under Joshua, they started with a great leader with a great plan. And they were inquiring of God as to what to do, and God led them. And at the at the end of Joshua, you remember that they promised to obey God. Remember, Josh was saying Choose you this day whom you will serve. But soon Israel broke their promise to obey God. And in chapter two of, of judges in verses seven and 10. We read in the people served the Lord all the days of Joshua and all the days of the elders who outlived Joshua, who had seen all the great work that the Lord had done for Israel, verse 10, and all the generation also all of that generation also were gathered to their fathers. And there arose another generation after them who did not know the Lord or the work that he had done for Israel.

Unknown Speaker  05:00
One of the first things that the Israelites were commanded to do was to drive out all the Canaanites. That is a huge part of the first part of judges. The writer dwells on the fact that they went to great lengths not to drive out the Canaanites. If you look at the latter half of chapter one, Israel became just like the Canaanites that they were supposed to drive out. And verse 11, of this chapter, and I've condensed this verses 11 through 15, the people of Israel did what was evil in the sight of the Lord and serve the bales, they abandon the Lord. They went after other gods from from among the gods of the peoples who are around them. And they provoked the Lord to anger they serve the bales and the astroturf, the anger of the Lord was kindled against Israel, and he gave them over to plunderers. He sold them into the hands of their surrounding enemies. The hand of the Lord was against them, and they were in terrible distress. God abandoned his people, but it wasn't God's choice. It was the people's choice. God even worked against the people, he let them be oppressed by the other nations that they chose to leave in Canaan around them. It's a sad time because they were left without a leader. They were left without direction, they were lost. But we know in Judges, there is a cycle, a recurring cycle, we call it sometimes the cycle of sin. And that's described in verse 16, beginning in verse 16, of judges to, again, I've condensed this, the Lord raised up judges who saved them out of the hands of those who plundered them. They soon turned aside from the way in which their fathers had walked, the Lord was with the judge, and he saved them from the hand of their enemies, all the days of the judge, the Lord was moved to pity by their groaning because of those who afflicted and oppress them. Whenever the judge died, they turned back and were more corrupt than their fathers, going after other gods serving them and bowing down to them, they did not drop any of their practices, or their stubborn ways. God in His mercy, despite their obedience, gave them delivers, or judges, or we might call them or describe them as military, tribal chieftains, but they were, God allowed them to deliver the Israelites when they were oppressed. But the sad thing is, is that the cycle and you remember the cycle, you've seen this before, when Israel would serve the Lord, and they would fall into idolatry, and they would be enslaved, they would cry out, God would raise up a judge, and then they would be delivered. But the the sad thing about that cycle is that when they came around back to serving the Lord, or being delivered, they would drop just a little bit, did you notice that, that they became more corrupt than their fathers each time that they, when they came back to the beginning of that circle, they were just a little bit more corrupt than they were, when they started. An example of that, well, here's, here's what we call a lock washer, you've probably seen one of these, you probably have them in your house. And they're they're putting on screws to help tighten things down. But this is a good example of what that cycle is about. It's not a it's a broken circle that's higher at the beginning than it is at the end. When you come around that circle, you're starting at a lower place, or you're ending up at a lower place than where you started. So if you had a series of those, a sequence of those, it would be a downward downward spiral. And that describes Israel through the book of Judges. An example of that is in chapter two, verse 13, compared to chapter 10. At the beginning of chapter two, it's when they abandon the Lord who did they go after with it says they abandoned the Lord and sort of the bales and the Ashtaroth. When you come to the middle of the book of Judges and chapter 10. Look at what the people are described as the people of Israel again did what was evil in the sight of the Lord and serve the bales in the Ashtaroth. We have those. But look at what's at it, the gods of Syria, the gods of Sidon, the gods have Moab the gods of the Ammonites, and the gods of the Philistines, and they pursued the Lord and did not serve Him. They're just adding to their list of gods that they are serving.

Unknown Speaker  09:24
I found this online from the Steve Thomason dotnet and I don't know his theology, so I'll I can't speak to what he believes. But I did contact him and he allowed me to use this slide I thought was interesting the way he described the downward spiral of of the Israelites in the book of Judges, as you see on the top, when they were under the leadership of Joshua, where they were on the road, but they soon broke through the guardrail. That's what that's a picture of, and then the downward spiral begins and he highlights Gideon, who we'll talk about in a few moments and also Sam Since at the end, and at the very end, they've they've come to the very bottom, the very depths of despair, and abandoned abandonment of God. But that's an interesting way to describe what happens in the book of Judges. We speak for just a moment about the structure of judges it guess what is another chiasm. It was the way that the ancients wrote to organize their, their their writings, and to remember their writings. But when you read your judges, you won't notice it at the beginning, that maybe the first time you read it, but it is a chiasm. And a couple of things that I know you can't read this, but and there's a couple things that you'll notice that are interesting at the very beginning, in the first verse, it says that the Israelites inquired of God, because they asked should we go up and fight and and God said, Yes, let Judah go up at the very end of judges, and you wouldn't expect this. There's your lights again, and choir a God, which they hadn't been doing for many years. And they said, should we go up and fight? And God says, yes, and up Judah, the same answer. You know what the difference is, they're fighting against their own. At the end, they're fighting vengeance, Judas fighting Benjamin, at the beginning, they were fighting the Canaanites. But it is, it is a clue that that's how the book is structured, that it is a chiasm. And it also I think, gives us another clue for something else, which we'll discuss in a moment. Another element of this chiasm are the women that are in the book, you have the leader, Deborah and JL, member JL Pierce, the head of Cicero, I believe it was. And then in a mirror of that is a emelec, was killed by a woman in chapters eight through 10. So you see that those parallels, and then the fulcrum, or the center of the book focuses on Gideon, you may not recognize that, but getting at the beginning of his life was faithful. He was a follower, he tore down the images of bail. But what happened at the end of his leadership, he was heap set up up an idol himself that was a snare to him and his people. So that's how the right most writers see how the structure, see the structure of judges, it hinges on Gideon, and everything before Gideon seemed to be pretty good everything after Gideon, not so much. The writer Kenneth may, in his commentary on judges, and Ruth says that judges is what he calls a ring structure, that there are parallels between different people or different groups of judges all through the book, as he says often yields rain or a period of leadership is parallel to Samson's in some way. Deborah is is similar to Elimelech. But there's also some vertical parallels as well, like Gideon, the first part of Gideons reign is very similar to the opening part of judges, and so on and so forth. And I haven't investigated all that. But it sounds really interesting. I think there is something to that. But if you were to take our lockwasher and apply it to this, and imply that the first part of that lockwasher at the prologue, and then circle around to the epilogue, that would be the end of your lockwasher. If you were to apply one image to this, like the the end the epilogue is much lower than the beginning of the book. But what what Mr. Mae does say and I've heard him comment on this is that he would put a dividing line right down the center. And he would say everything to the left, beginning with the prologue down to the first half of Gideons reign is the positive side of judges and everything to the right is the negative side because beginning with the second half of Gideons, Gideons leadership, until the end of the book, everything is pretty much in a downward spiral. So that's essentially another interesting way to to look at the structure of the book of Judges.

Unknown Speaker  14:12
But getting back to another the point we've made previously, instead of driving out the Canaanites, what happened? They allowed them to live with them. And they became like them in the worst ways, because we read of rape and murder and the worship of of Baal and other gods sacrificing their own children fighting amongst themselves. And Israel was characterized by pride and lust and vengeance, not at all whom the Lord wanted them to be. And not only that, but the judges themselves were evil. Not all of them of course, but in in many cases, the judges themselves were evil and seem to get worse. And if you compare the judges as we noted at the beginning of the book to the end, You can see a very marked difference. At the beginning often eel and E food and Shamgar don't seem to have anything negative said about them. Deborah, along with jail were very two strong women. And they delivered Israel from the Canaanites. Bay rack who is mentioned in Hebrews 11 served under Deborah as the leader of the army. At the beginning, he was hesitant to go out and never had to encourage him to go. And in the end, another woman as as Deborah had predicted, another woman would come and take the glory instead of Bayrock himself. Then we come to Gideon, he had doubts. He wanted assurances before he would be the leader. He did Yes, tear down the the the altar of bail, but God had to tell him to go do that to encourage him to go do that. Gideon had many wives he made an ephod which Israel worshipped as an idol and it became a snare to him and all of Israel. And that was the the rapid This began the rapid descent of Israel. Abimelech, who was Gideon son is made a king not really a judge, but was made a king. And his name ironically means my father is king. He killed 70 of his own brothers, he engaged in a war of mutual destruction with Shechem. And then we come to Jeptha. He was the son of a prostitute he was driven out of his home own home, he associated with a rough crowd, he made a rash bow. And and probably what's meant by these rash bows is that they thought they had to make vows to, to the real God as they were doing to the false gods. That was the way that people around them did. So he, as we know, lost his own daughter in that rash bow. Samsung was strong, but had a weakness for women. He was conceited and vengeful, he, he broke his Nazirite vows, he had fits of rage. And God used his weakness against him. And then Eli and Samuel, who aren't really in the book of Judges, but come later, but even they had their faults and that they, neither one of them controlled their sons as they should have. We come to the book to the end of the book of Judges chapter 17, through through 21, some very interesting things occur. There's no judge, I don't know if you had realized that and these five chapters no judge is mentioned in chapter 17, through 21. The phrase, The Spirit of the Lord is not found, in these five chapters in the last quarter of the book of Judges. The priesthood is made to be a personally profitable thing. The Levites have abandoned the real priesthood, and their real service to God. And the phrase, there was no king in Israel, everyone did what was right in their own eyes occurs over and over again. And in fact, it's the last line of the book of Judges, because that describes what had come of the become of the people of Israel. They did what was right in their own eyes, might makes right had become the rule. And in one example, here are several examples. I'll give of this, this last section and one example that people have Dan, forcefully take a priest, and then they take over a country or a region and murder innocent men, women and children to just take over their land. They were making their own rules about religion and what they think they thought it should be, and reminiscent of Lot and Sodom and Gomorrah, a concubine is repeatedly violated by men until she dies. And her husband sins, pieces of her human body throughout the land, presumably, as a message and call to arms, so to speak, a very McCobb and disturbing message. In this last part of the book of Judges.

Unknown Speaker  19:15
Israel goes to war against its own, it goes to war against Benjamin, and both sides take heavy losses. And then because of another rash bow, a whole town is murdered, and the young women are taken away to be given in marriage to complete strangers. So the phrase everyone did what was right in their own eyes. The last line of judges tells us how far they fallen because you've compared the very first line of judges. It says, The people were inquiring of God. They had completely abandoned God. It's how far they'd fallen from promising under Joshua to keep God's laws and serve Him in the new land to serving other gods and warring among themselves and committing all kinds of unspeakable acts. Now to be sure, there are pockets of good things that happen in the book of Judges. We recently studied the book of Ruth. Well, that the context was the time of the judges. And we read about Boaz and all the good things he did. And the fact that David came from from Naomi and Boaz and Ruth. So a good thing came from that time. And we need to remember to that that under some of the judges, they had a piece that lasted for decades. So who knows what was going on during those times, it could have been all bad. But certainly there were some good things going on, such as the story of Ruth. And it does seem that some of the judges seem to follow God or have some knowledge of God in their life. There does seem to be an inquiring of God, not only at the first but perhaps at the very end of judges. And that is given perhaps to tell us of the hope that there is for this people, the Ark of the Covenant is mentioned, the house of God at Shiloh was mentioned. And the people do respond to the call of the evil done to the concubine, they at least do respond to that evil. And we know this was the, the that right after this was the period of the kings, and while the Kings themselves were flawed, and actually they acted exactly as God warned the people that they would act that did bring Israel together. And so maybe we need to look at this as them hitting bottom. The nation had to get to bottom out before they would come back and serve God at least together for a while. This phrase, The Spirit of the Lord, which I mentioned before, maybe another positive thing that we can see in the book of Judges, it is active, God is active, his spirit is active. It's alive and well, at least until you get to the end of judges, but it is active. And it's it's described as affecting four different judges. The first being off O'Neill it says, The Spirit of the Lord came upon him. And after that he defeated the king of Mesopotamia. With getting it was said to clothe him, the Spirit of the Lord clothed him and after that he called people to follow him. And many, many men came to serve in his army. Jeff is also described as being upon him, and after that he defeated the Ammonites. But the one of whom this phrase is spoken of the most, of course, is Samson, four different times, this phrase is used that it began to stir him, and then it rushed upon him. And then we see him doing powerful things, killing the lion, killing Philistines in large numbers. So and perhaps what we're supposed to understand from this, is that it is a demonstration of God's power in certain situations, given to certain people, but to fulfill God's purposes. And it's not to, to say that everything that that person did got approved of, but his purposes were being accomplished at that time. But again, this phrase does not occur in the last part of the book of Judges. The Book of Judges shows us what happens when people abandon God. And it's not pretty. But it also does show us a time of God's mercy he did send delivers, even when they turn their back time after time upon God. So back to Hebrews 11. Why are Gideon and Bay rack and Samsung and Jeptha mentioned in the hall of fame of faith, and why not some of these other judges, of whom nothing negative is said whatsoever?

Unknown Speaker  24:03
Well, the writer of Hebrews does not say that these are good judges. He doesn't say that we should be like them, or make the same choices they did. Remember that the point of this chapter, is one of faith and in fact, in in chapter 10, the the chapter previous to chapter 11, it encourages the readers to draw nearer, with a full assurance of faith. Let me just read this Hebrews 10, beginning in verse 19. Therefore brothers since we have confidence to enter the holy places by the blood of Jesus by the new and loving way that he opened for us through the curtain that is through his flesh. And since we have a great priest over the house of God, let us draw near, with a true heart in full assurance of faith with our hearts sprinkled clean from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water. Let us hold fast that confession of our hope without wavering for he who promises faithful and Let us consider how to stir one up. Stir up one another to love and good words, not neglecting to meet together as as is the habit of some, but encouraging one another and all the more as you see the day drawing near. Not only that, but in verse 35, we read, therefore do not throw away your confidence which has great reward, for you have need of endurance, so that when you have done the will of God, you may receive what is promised for yet a little while, and the coming one will come and not delay, but my righteous one shall live by faith. And if he shrinks back, my soul has no pleasure in him. For we are not of those who shrink back and are destroyed, but of those who have faith and preserve their soul. So what's the writer trying to say? He's trying to encourage his readers to keep the faith through troubled times, keep on keeping on keep enduring. And what's he going to do to show them that he's gonna give them great examples to bolster their faith, and that's what he does in chapter 11. So the writer seems to be emphasizing the positive details of people in chapter 11, who perhaps had an imperfect faith. judges on the other hand seems to have a negative objective to emphasize emphasize the downfall of Israel, and therefore emphasize the negative negative aspects of its leaders on on whole. But to encourage the readers, the writer is showing that God has done incredible things through people remember what Gideon did with just 300 men what Samsung did with the jawbone of a dunking, and this is to inspire faith. In chapter 11, and we'll read verse 32, again and read through 34. This is where we started, for what more shall I say, for time will fail me to tell of Gideon Bay rec Samsung Jeptha, of David, and Samuel, and the prophets, who, through faith, conquered kingdoms and forced justice, obtain promises stop the mouths of lions quench the power of fire, escape the edge of the sword were made strong out of weakness, became mighty in war, put foreign armies to fly. These things weren't done through the power of men, but through the power of God. The men had faults, they made really bad choices, but God's will was done. God gets the credit. So in what sense, did they have this faith? I believe they had trust in God and experienced a sampling of his power through themselves that demonstrated God's purposes being done. Hebrews 11 is giving us the wide view of the examples faith not an examination of every aspects aspect of your life, but to give a wide view of faith, and what God can do through people. And so, going a little bit further, I think the key to Hebrews 11 is chapter 12. If we read past the break the end of chapter 11, and read into chapter 12. All of these beginning in verse 39. All of these, though commended through their faith did not receive what was promised, since God had provided something better for us, that apart from us, they should not be made perfect. Therefore, since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, let us also lay aside every weight, and sin which is clean so closely and let us run with endurance. There's that word endurance again, the race that is set before us, looking to Jesus, the founder and perfecter of our faith, who for the joy that was set before Him endured the cross despising the shame, and is seated at the right hand of the throne of God consider him who endured from sinners such hostility against himself so that you may not grow weary. Or fainthearted. Jesus perfects imperfect faith, which we all have, which all of those of chapter 11 had, like Samson, and Jeptha, and Gideon, God's greatest work, his greatest display of power was accomplished through His Son.

Unknown Speaker  29:18
So consider the examples of chapter 11. And then consider the founder of our faith, Jesus Christ. He made perfect choices in life, even through hostility and shame, and crucifixion. And he sits at the right hand of God. And did you notice who was written who was included in verse 32 of chapter 11? Samson along with Samson and Gideon, David and Samuel great men, but you know what flawed too. They trusted in God and saw his power on numerous occasions. Throughout the rest of chapter 11, we see A lot of examples, and I think I've got them all listed here. All of them had flaws. Now you might argue, how do we know that about Abel, or Enoch? Or you even might even argue, Joseph? Well, we don't know, really their whole life, we don't know. We're only given snippets of their of their life. But we do know that they all trusted in God and they died in faith. Both books, judges and Hebrews have their own strong messages. A couple things to remember, don't, don't view one book through the lens of another. Each has its Egypt stands on its own merit, and has its own message. So don't focus on the feeble heroes of chapter 11. Look to the powerful, true hero in Jesus Christ. So which of these characters would you recommend somebody be like? Well, you might first go to Joseph. But we don't know everything Joseph did. He may have had some character flaws. Sure, the ones we read about are very commendable. And we can emulate those. But we should only always have one role model. And that's Jesus Christ. Both books, though, we could say, make us want to see God. Judges does. And Hebrews does as well. And before I close, just some brief applications, from what we've read, when when leaders don't pass on their teaching and wisdom to their successors, that endeavor is destined to fail. And that's true of a business. If if a business leader doesn't teach the junior partners, those that are coming up in the business, and they want that business to continue, if they don't teach them about that business, it's going to fail. But it's true of your family. Your children will quickly abandoned God, if they're not taught by your word and example. We've got to teach them, we can't abandon our family to the world. It's true in the church, we must teach each other in the church, or we're going to fail. We've got to drive out sin. Parents must drive out threats to the family. Don't let those threats live at home with you. And those threats, as you know, can come in a whole lot of different forms. And we've talked about that a lot. But we've got to drive them out. Elders, and all of us must not tolerate false teaching and sin in the church. If it is tolerated, it won't be long before it's comfortable, and then embraced. And in the sense that we are Christians, and we're lights, in that sense, we're all leaders. Lights give direction when it's dark. So in that sense, we do act as leaders to those that we come in contact with. Don't hide your light. But also, don't let your light be dimmed by compromise with sin. If it moves in, it's likely to stay. Drive the Canaanites out of your life, whatever it takes. Go back and read how often Joshua told the tribes to drive those people out. And the excuses they gave for not doing it, and look how they ended up. If we don't drive out sin from our lives will become like it will worship it. And we'll be enslaved to it. To know God includes realizing who he is and what he's done. That's what the Israelites forgot. They forgot that he had delivered them from Egypt. Let us not forget and not forget to teach that God delivered us from sin, and that he was merciful, and gave His Son on our behalf. And this probably could have been a separate point but but trust God, as the examples of Hebrews 11 teach, and who knows whether or not God will accomplish great things through you. Trust God.

Unknown Speaker  34:20
And don't be enamored with one particular Christians. One person's life. Don't idolize them to the point that that you you do set them on that pedestal because what happens when that person stumbles? That means your faith may take a hit. What happens to your faith then, when you're converted? You're not converted to a church or a person, but to Jesus Christ, because he won't fail you. Let's not forget that. And as we try to put on care God's character in our life let's not forget that he showed mercy to People at the worst point in their life. Let's consider people's circumstances, let's consider their background and be patient, and merciful as we try to influence them for good. A side point, I didn't even put this on the list, but I'm under no illusion that America is God's chosen nation. So I'll say that at the beginning. But the founders as a whole did did seem to have a belief in the God of the Bible. And, and much of our American principles seem to have biblical beginnings seem to seem to. But now, some 250 years later, much of America has abandoned God, we know that our country seems more and more drawn to violence and blood in different forms. It's interesting that the book of Judges covers roughly 325 years and that's not much older than America is. It took only that long to go from its godly beginnings under Joshua to the ungodly end of its downward spiral. But just as in Judges, there's always hope. There are to be sure many godly people in this country, as long as people follow God, there will be light and there will be hope. We must continue to let our light shine in the darkness, even if the country in which we live ultimately fails. Judges is a is a sad book, Israel left God and embrace the gods of the world. And they did what was right in their own eyes. They had no one strong moral character capable of leading them and sometimes they had to go search for somebody to lead them even if he was not that strong of a moral character. They had no shepherd. No one was teaching them about God and His mercy. At least we're not informed of it. No one was there to look after the innocent and the helpless. In fact, many of the innocent and helpless were murdered. When a judge died, Israel reverted to its old ways. So the book of just as in Hebrews 11, it points us to Jesus in the book of Judges. It leaves us longing for a judge that's different, a selfless one a righteous one, a judge who will both defeat our enemies and help the helpless and help the innocent, and a judge that won't be overcome by death. Well, guess what? We have that judge in Jesus Christ. We've received such a judge he has all strength, he has all compassion. We give God glory and praise for his great gift. You might be here this morning and you need to respond to Jesus you may need to to acknowledge Him as your Savior and submit to His will concerning your salvation. If you have need of coming forward this morning we asked you to come as we stand and sing the song together.
