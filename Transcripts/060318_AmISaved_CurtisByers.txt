I suspect there's a lot of questions we could ask and many important questions that we asked in our service to our father. But probably the most important question one might ask is, What must I do to be saved? That that is in fact, the exact question that the flippin jailer asked Paul. And as He was caring for Paul's wounds, as very similar to the question that the Jews on Pentecost asked Peter, the rest of the apostles, when they came to understand that they had been those among those who have crucified the Lord, what must I do to be saved. But once one has become a Christian, you know, life goes on. And we try to grow and try to learn more about what God would have us to do. And we sometimes stumble, we sometimes sin, we sometimes lose our focus. Here's another question that confronts us that we are tempted to ask. And that's the question, Am I saved? That's a question that many ask, and I think is a legitimate question deserves an answer. And I'd like for us to think about that question there. Now, it's good to see you. Good to have each of you here with us tonight, our assembly is always a good thing to come together with you, with others who might be visiting with us and to worship our God and our Father in heaven. We are We are people most blessed. And to have this opportunity where we can freely come and easily come to an assembly of God's people to worship him to think about his things, it was truly a blessing and a one that we ought not to take for granted. Now and asking this particular question, no, there are other questions that are not on the table there are not being asked because I'm not attempting to ask this, you know, I have no doubt that there are some fundamental things that we all would agree upon. And unfortunately, oh, God takes the initiative in our salvation. So we're not trying to suggest and by the question, Am I saved if somehow we're the ones who are this prompting this salvation now that salvation comes from God, He has saved us by His grace and His His grace and mercy and love for us. That prompted him to do the things he has done for us in Christ Jesus. So that's not being questioned at all in this question, I don't think nor are we doubting the faithfulness of God. God is faithful. And he is powerful. So he's able to fulfill any promise that He has given. He has the will, and he has the ability to do what he says, And God has always done what he says. But I think we would all agree that that is a truth that we can stand by. Nor are we any way questioning the sufficiency of Christ's sacrifice. If we ask the question, Am I say we're not suggesting by that question, that somehow the sacrifice that was given for us was insufficient are not able to forgive us of our sins? No. The blood of Christ cleanses us from our sins, that is a certainty that we can bank on. But there the question still remains, though Am I say? Now, I will suggest as we start to study, I think well, it might be helpful is to look at some responses that people give to this question. This is a this is a question not just we might think of, or I might think this is a question a lot of people have given thought to it, a lot of different people have given various answers to this question. So I think it might be helpful for us to kind of lay that out before us to help us see what others have said, in answer to this question. First, consider, what I'm just going to call the center in despair. This is the person who thinks he has done so many things that are bad. In fact, there are so bad there's just no way that God's going to forgive me. But he cannot imagine how that even though God he's totally God is a loving God and a merciful God. He just believes that the sins he has committed are being so heinous, that even God and all his mercy cannot forgive him. I've heard of people like this. I don't think I've ever met a person like this. They would ask them no. To that question. No, they're Nice save. And not only are they not say they they will say they can't be saved. Of course, we think they are wrong, but that's the least that's the way they see it. On the other side of the spectrum, there are those who will say, Yes, I'm saved. In fact, I believe that everybody is saved the Universalist.

Curtis Byers  04:49
They believe in God's love and mercy is so much that they cannot envision a God who would not say everybody so will not. And so whether you ask them that question of the day, or if you would ask that question 10 years from now, they will say, of course, I'm saved and what by the way, you're saying to they believe that everybody is saved. And they would, then they go to Scripture. And they would point to passages like First Corinthians 1522, for example, where there a says, whereas a lot as an animal dies, so also in Christ shall all be made alive. And he will make the observation will all people die. And we are told that all people die because Adam, sin, and sin and Adam brought death into the world. And so says all people die because of Adam. And clearly the, the parallel would be that all people not just saw, but all people will be made alive in Christ Jesus. Or they might look at a passage, like First Peter one, verse 13, which says, Therefore preparing your minds for action and being sober minded, set your hope fully on the grace that will be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ. It says, set your hope fully, that means confidently 100%, upon the grace of God, and at the revelation that I take that to be at the end times, that we will be brought by God's grace into glory. And there are other passages in the scriptures that they would point to, they try to make the point that not only they but all people will ultimately be saved, and no one will be lost that number of people, the people who believe this is not a small number, it's a, it's a fairly good sized group of people. Then there's the I'm just gonna say it, here's the unreflective person. This is kind of the person who's just kind of just going through life, and taking care of business as they encounter various things, but really don't think too much about upon life itself for what the purpose of life is. They're the type where one thing goes in one ear, and it comes out the other right, and there's not much processing that goes on in between they, they tend to maybe often just, you know, cast this question often to somebody else, maybe they're going to let their preacher or their spouse or somebody else deal with this kind of question. And they're just not going to get too upset about it, they're just going to go on and take care of each day as it comes. I have known people like that, I think. And that's, that's sad, that's really sad. At least a sinner in despair knows that they need something. And I think therefore, they are teachable. This person really doesn't know that they need anything. They really don't know whether or not anything about salvation, or that's something they should be concerned about, because they've just never really taken the time to think about it or to deal with it. So this person really does not know how to answer this question. There are others. There's who I'm gonna just call the elect Calvinists. A Calvinism is a fairly pervasive system is pretty commonplace, and many Protestant groups, roundabout us, that's the complete system. The fundamental belief about Calvinism is that God is in control of everything. And for God, to be in control, for God to be sovereign, means that God has to make all decisions. And that means that everything that has come to pass, or that will come to pass is the direct result of God's will, and of God's power. And so there are going to be those who are saved, they would think those are the people that are called the elect. And these are people that God is particularly selected by name. Even before the foundation, the world, we're gonna said that Joe and Mary and Bill and whoever else, though those are the people that aren't going to save. And I'm going to say in Christ, to save those people. And I'm going to send my spirit upon those people. So they will respond to me, and they will do good works, a Calvinist Calvinists believes in doing good works, and let Calvinists and that those people who are therefore elected by God, and God has given us they will be saved, because that's what that's what God has intended from the very beginning, that they will be saved and therefore, they are saved. And so, the problem is,

Curtis Byers  09:45
the catch is, you never know if you're one of those electric not because the Calvinist was say that there's no way of knowing we might do all of the most wonderful works in the world. which was given, you know, the indication that we are one of God's people, one of the lead, but who knows, at the 11th hour, we may turn our back on on God, and start doing those things that are evil, and it just shows that we were never part of the elect to start with. Or maybe we're the type that has been a very unreflective person, you know, for the most of our life. And if you look at that person, you would never say that they're part of the elect. But who knows, maybe at the 11th hour, that person is given the Spirit of God and they are regenerated, and they then start showing the works of being the Elector. Maybe they are one of the electorate and just didn't show it for a very, very long time. See, there's there's no knowledge really, in a Calvinist, so I'm going to move even though the Calvinists talks as if they are one of the elect, they believe that they're one of the elect, there's really no way that they know that. So I'm gonna move them to the middle. Because they cannot know. Right? They cannot know whether or not they're going to let because God has made that known. There's another type of Calvinists, and sometimes it's called moderate Calvinism. I'm going to just use the description. The one save always save Calvinist in fact, really the term Calvinists, I could have just left that off, and just say the one saved, always saved person. These people often have a ton of Calvinism in their in their theology, but, but they do believe that a person can respond to the gospel, that they're not necessarily just the alette. But some will say that, yes, I'm gonna say no to that question. But if you can, a person can respond to the gospel. And at once a person responds to the gospel, that is a once for all decision. So if you have if you respond and believe, to the gospel call of Jesus Christ, and you do that when you're say, 18 years old, then it doesn't matter. What happens after that point in time that you will be saved. That's what once saved, always saved and saved means. It means regardless of what you do, you will be saved. That just seems a little bit hard to believe. And it's little bit hard maybe to believe it. Some people say that so I've, I've got here a quote from one person. This is an older quote, but quite honestly, I could, I could fill up pages of quotes from modern authors who were saying the same thing this person did back in the mid 20th century and work back then. This is what he said, listen to what he said. We take the position that a Christian sins, do not Damn his soul, the way a Christian lives, what he says his character, his conduct, or his attitude toward other people, have nothing whatsoever to do with the salvation of his soul. All the prayers of man may pray all the Bibles he may read all the churches, he may belong to all the services he may attend all the sermons he may practice all the debts he may pay all the ordinances he may observe all the laws he may keep all the benevolent acts he may perform, will not make his soul one whit safer. And all the sins He may come in from idolatry to murder will not make his soul in any more danger. Salvation is subtle once and for all when we believe the way I live has nothing whatsoever to do with the salvation of my soul. Startling, isn't it to read that that's just startling. But that's that's the position of someone who believes in once saved, always saved. Now that's not to say that he's incorrect, he's not gonna He's not gonna encouraging people to go out and live badly. He's he's not doing that intentionally. He's, you know, he would probably other sermons that this guy gave, he probably wouldn't courage people to live good lives and do good things. But that is that is the essence of, of his belief. And he really acknowledges and quite honestly, again, I could name you several and modern authors and find you quotations of various I'm very similar to that. So it's a very prevalent teaching, just once saved, always saved doctrine.

Curtis Byers  14:28
There are some things that are common to all of these positions except for perhaps the unreflective person. And that is they're all certain to their answer. Every one of them believes that their answer is the correct answer to the question for them at that particular time. The center in despair believes truly believes that no, they're not going to be saved because they've done some things are too far. Their understanding of God is wrong. But based upon their understanding, they're certain of that answer. Just as much So as the Universalist is certain of his answer that was saved always, there's certain of their answers. There's no doubt in their mind that they know the answer to that question, regardless of where they fall within that spectrum, there are certain and they are they would all say that their certainty is based upon their understanding of Scripture. Clearly, they don't understand scripture, like, certainly they don't understand what Scripture like. But all it was saying that they understand Scripture. And they have come to a conclusion firm conclusion about this particular question, based upon their understanding the Scripture and all, I believe are wrong, you probably believe they're wrong to some might cringe at that thought and say, Well, we're being judgmental. Well, they would think we were wrong also. So I mean, you know, that's kind of common to this question. I think they are wrong, but they in turn thinking that I'm wrong, you know, so, you know, that's just that's just the nature of nature of the question. You know, people place a great deal of stock in being certain, and being able to answer this question I'm gonna save. They want to have certainty in their answer to this question. But I would suggest by simply looking at these various positions, and knowing that each of them are certain will suggest to us that certainty is not the main thing. being searched, uncertain about our answer is not the main thing or the most important thing. Now we will we weren't, we weren't sure we have the right answer. Right. But having the belief, the certainty that our answer is correct is clearly not the end all be all, because look at the various positions that people are certain about. And we really shouldn't be surprised about that over Matthew seven, a passage that Mark brought up in his Bible class this morning, when he is that he has given a lot of thought to I think all of us have given thought to this passage. This is the this is the judgment scene passage there. Where the text says, verse 21, Not everyone who says to Me, Lord, Lord will enter the kingdom of heaven. But the one who does the will of My Father on that day, many will say, Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name and cast out demons in your name, and do mighty works in your name? And then I will declare to them, I never knew you depart from me, you workers of lawlessness, I get the impression that these people to whom the Lord is speaking thought they were saved. They cast out demons. They had prophesied, they had done mighty works. They call upon the name of the Lord, they thought they were saved. But Jesus said, they weren't there rather than if they were to depart from him. So how bold how certain can we be? When we are asked this question? Am I say that as we have reflected on that, I want us to just look at a several passages. First, let's look at some passages that give us assurance. And these are passages that I've, I've seen, many refer to, in fact, many brethren have used these passages. Because they to many of the lessons I've heard, I've been listening to a lot of sermons on this topic among brother and others. And that seems to be the desire to want to give certainty. So here's the passages that people use first, John Five, Verse 13. The text says, I write these things to you who believe in the name of the Son of God, that you may know that you have eternal life. Why is John writing these things to this particular group of people these particular things, so that they might know that they have eternal life? So if these people were asked the question, Am I save what will be the answer they should give? Or maybe in First Corinthians, the first chapter, verse seven. There, Paul says, so that you are not lacking in any gift. As you wait for the revealing of our Lord Jesus Christ, who will sustain you to the end, guiltless and the day of our Lord Jesus Christ.

Curtis Byers  19:20
This passage says that we are waiting, okay, we are waiting for that final day the revelation, Lord, and that is the Lord Jesus Christ who will sustain us. Not the emphasis not upon our sustaining ourselves with emphasis on the Lord sustaining us. And it is the Lord who will declare us if I read this correctly, guiltless in that day. Or even John 316 are the most well known passage. For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son that whosoever believes in Him shall not perish, but have ever have eternal life. The King James says shall not perish right shall not not perish but have everlasting life. You believe you have everlasting life, or half of the passage and Second Timothy, fourth chapter where Paul, in his latter days, made this comment to Timothy. He says, I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race, I have kept the faith, his fourth is laid out for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord the righteous drawer will judge will wore to me on that day, and not only to me, but also to all who love His appearance. That sounds pretty confident, that sounds pretty bold in those but I would also suggest that we read all of God's Word. And then we open up the scriptures and continue to read and we will find passages like this even in First John, in the very same book, where he talks about that he wrote these things so that you may know that you have eternal life, he also draw in the past also said this. He says, I am a little children writing these things to you. So the so that you may not sin. But if anyone does sin, we have an advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ, the righteous. He is the propitiation for our sins, and not for ours only, but also for the sins of the whole world. And by this, we know that we have come to know Him if we keep his commandments. Notice that John envisioned the possibility of Christian sinning, but he's writing to Christians, and he's urging them not to sin. He says, but if you do, then you have an ad, we have an advocate for the father of Jesus Christ, the righteous. And he means we can go to God and ask for forgiveness and the blood of Christ will cleanse us of the sins that we commit even as a Christian but you know, we have to do that. And then he says, By this we know here's someone else we know that we have come to know Him. If we keep his commandments, you know, scriptures is full of his lips. They just pop up all kinds of places. And if we take our if seriously, we would have to temper what we have read there first, John 513. With what we're reading here, First John to write we had to temper it a little bit. Or how about a passage like overclocking was the first chapter there the Paul says, and you were once alienated and hostile and mind doing evil deeds, he has now reconciled in His body of flesh by his death, in order to present you holy and blameless, above, above reproach before him as the guiltless ideal that we read over there. And First Corinthians seven, verse 23, if indeed, you continue in the faith, stable and steadfast, not shifting from the hope of the gospel that you heard, which has been claimed in all creation, under heaven, of which Paul in which I, Paul became the minister and another one of those lives, right? Paul, Jesus is prepared to present us to the Father blameless and wholly above reproach he's reconciled us for that purpose. If we continue in the faith, if we don't shift from the hope that we have heard. And then in First Corinthians nine is another statement that the apostle Paul made that need to kind of read alongside the one he made over there and Second Timothy Leary, in talking to the Corinthians brothers, he himself says, so I do not run aimlessly. I do not box as one beating the air, but I discipline my body and keep it under control. Lest after preaching to others, I myself should be disqualified. Was Paul honest? In that statement? Was it possible for Paul to be disqualified? He thought so. So what did he do he discipline his body to keep it under control, so that he would not be disqualified.

Curtis Byers  24:21
So, what do we say though? How are we to answer this question? Am I saved? Like to first suggest that we make a distinction between two words and, and that's the word assurance and the word confidence. If you go to the dictionary, and look, those two words will be seen as synonyms. But I think many people I've seen many people make a distinction between those words in various contexts. And for our purposes, I like to make a distinction in those words, now, by certainty, I would suggest that that implies as absolute 100% certainty, there is no variation when when you say that you are certain of something that suggests there is not the possibility of being wrong. That's what I mean by certain. And I've suggested, let's take that in that sense. So we have complete assurance. Confidence, on the other hand, is not one of complete certainty. But as of high belief value, we have a high degree of belief in something in which we have confidence, we believe that our knowledge is reliable. And I'd like to give you this analogy isn't maybe even more meaningful to me are a few others in the room, but there might be to you but just as meaningful to me, I'm gonna, I'm gonna give it to you anyway. You know, various professions, people have to be licensed in order to practice that profession. And the license is only given to those people who have undergone a certain course of study, and who have achieved a certain level of experience, and to gain some expertise. And once they get to that point, then they are given a license to practice. Right. Now, among architects and engineers, that's the Harry on a little bit about Norman does too. And we are asked as practitioners, oftentimes to certify that the work we have done particular the documents that we have prepared, are in compliance with the building code. Well, that sounds simple. But the building code contains 1000s of pages. There is a single document about this thick, but then it contains other references other documents which it adopts, which many other volumes as though there are 1000s of pages that comprise the building code. And if an architect or engineer is asked to certify that the work that they have done, is in compliance with the building code. Do you think the Arctic engineer can say that the best true with 100% Certainty you think any architect or engineer in his right mind would sign a statement saying with 100% certainty, I know that my work complies with every one of those paragraphs and every one of those 1000s of pages? Well, no, and really, quite honestly, the building official doesn't expect them to, there have been many of the letters that I have signed, that says, To the best of my knowledge, my work is in compliance with the building code. And every building official that I've ever worked with, is willing to take that, to the best of my knowledge, I've complied with the building code. You see the distinction there between absolute certainty, in fact that, you know, the, the, we're so certain about that? We're so certain that our work, or we're, we're to the best of our knowledge, we're confident that our work is is right, because we let people go into buildings that we design, right? We let people go in there, and we really don't ever fear about the building falling down on top of us, do we? Do you ever think about that, when you enter into a building? Do you ever worry about the building coming down on top of you, when you walk into it? You have a pretty high degree of confidence that that building is safe. Do you have 100% certainty that is safe? I have high degree of confidence, even one chances design, I would have a high degree of confidence that it would be safe to go into battle have 100% certainty. That is correct. I don't think chance would either. Right. So how do you answer this question? Well, I would suggest that appropriate answer this question, provided that we are doing what we read and studying scripture, to the best of our knowledge that we can answer the question, yes, I am saved to the best of my knowledge. The best of my knowledge, certainly belongs with God. God is the judge. He's the only one that is certain of my salvation or not. But I believe that God's word is understandable.

Curtis Byers  29:22
And I believe that God's word can be known. And I believe that God's word can be done. And I think you do too. I think you can be confident that when you became a Christian, what did you do? Well, in general terms, you read what God said. You understand what God was asking of you. And you did what you believe God was asking you to do. And when you did that, did you have confidence that you're a Christian? Do you have confidence that your sins were forgiven as God has promised? I did, did you? Because I believed I are still what God asked. And I believe I did what God ask. And based upon that, understanding that upon that action, I confidence that God's promises would be true. So I would ask that it does make a difference how we answer this question, if we simply answer this question. Yes, period. In fact, I, you know, in listening to all the sermons I was telling, talking to you about, uh, there are some who go so far to say that unless we're 100% Certain, and when we answer this question, unless we can say with 100% certainty that we are saved and something's wrong. Thinking there's something wrong if we do say, or do ask this question, yes. 100%? Certainly. Because what's gonna be the, what's gonna be our tendency? If we answer that question, yes, I am. 100% certain that I'm saying that this point in time, what's gonna be our tendency? Why change? Why do anything different? Why, why learn anything else? I've already done what I needed to do to be saved. And so I'm there. This kind of coast on but if you ask me the question, yes, to the best of my knowledge, I'm saved. What are you going to do then? Well, you're going to continue to try to learn, you're gonna continue to try to weigh your life against what Scripture says. And we can do that. God has not made his will explicable. It's not something that he takes a PhD to understand. Right? God's will is knowable. Right? And just as we had confidence, and when we became a Christian, we ought to have confidence that we can live the Christian life. But let us understand that as requires our best efforts. And I believe that's consistent with the instruction, we have a New Testament, listen to me as I read these passages. And what's the tenor of the what's the tenor of the tone that's being set forth in these passages Ephesians four, verse one's capacity, says, Paul says, I, therefore a prisoner for the Lord urged you to walk in a manner worthy of the calling to wish you had been called with all humility, and gentleness, with patience, bearing with one another love, eager to maintain the unity of the Spirit in the bond of peace. He said, I urge you to walk in a manner worthy of the calling fusions Five, Verse 15. Look carefully, then how you walk, not as unwise, but as wise making the best use of time, because the days are evil, Therefore do not be foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is. In Philippians, two, therefore, my beloved, as you have always obey, so now not only in my presence, but much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling. And Hebrews 10, verse 23, let us hold fast, the confession of our hope without wavering, for He who promised is faithful. I like that passage. God is faithful was our part the whole fast without wavering.

Curtis Byers  33:41
A second Peter the first chapter, first five. For this very reason, make every effort to supplement your faith or virtue and virtue with knowledge and knowledge with self control and self control with steadfastness and steadfastness with godliness and godliness with brotherly kindness, from brotherly affection, and brotherly affection with love for if these qualities are yours and are increasing. They keep you from being ineffective or unfruitful and knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ, for whoever lacks these qualities and so nearsighted. He is blind, having forgotten that he is was cleansed from his former sins. Therefore, brothers, be all the more diligent to confirm your lecture calling an election for if you practice these qualities, you will never fall if you practice these qualities, you will never follow. We certainly don't want to be like the the sinner in despair, who just believes that we can't please God and nothing we do will be acceptable. That's not where we want to be. But we also don't want to be at the other extreme, where we say that I'm saved and I know I'm saying I'm 100% confident that I'm safe. Because you know, the certain passages in scripture might suggest that let's read of all scripture and let's be calm. Put in the God who gave His Son for us as be confident the sacrifice of His Son. Let's be confident and knowledge that God has intentionally made His Word and His will unknowable. It wouldn't be, he would not be a good God if he didn't. And let us strive each day to grow into increasing our knowledge to add various virtues, to the life as a Christian, increasing the fruit that we produce, believing that we understand what God has said, and that upon that basis, and upon His goodness, there'll be a home in heaven, waiting for us at that day. That is a good message that we can preach, because that's the message of scripture. But let's be careful not to preach more than what Scripture says. There's any here this evening who are subjected to the Imitation of Christ, who maybe have not yet put on Christ, who may even be the sort of mind thinking that you know, there's nothing you have or everything that you've done in life has told you that you can't be saved. Well, no, the New Testament, God through the New Testament has told us yes, you can be saved, and you can be saved through His Son, that He gave on a cross, that through his blood, we can have the forgiveness of our sins and it's through debt forgiveness, that we can have confidence to come before our father. If there's any here this night, please come as we stay in the same room.
