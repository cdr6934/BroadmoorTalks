Good morning. It's good to see everyone here today, we have a good crowd, we have many visitors want to extend my appreciation to you for being here. Our goal here at Broadmoor is to give God glory and honor and praise and all that we do. And so we do that in our Bible study in this time of worship. And we also seek to do that as we leave here. We want our lives to be filled with godliness, and a light that reflects him. So if you're visiting with us, we appreciate you being with us and glad that you came here to worship with us. It's been a great day so far, hasn't it? We have new classes, there's always some excitement. So I'm looking forward to tomorrow's class on discipleship. We had a good class this morning, I'm sure the classes in the back also got off to a good start. So it's a good day to be able to study God's Word and think about how we can grow closer to Him. It's been a good day to be able to raise our voices in song as we sing together and think about our God as a rock. That was encouraging. It was encouraging to hear the words that were sung, it was encouraging that you were singing to me, and I was singing to you. So it's been a good day. It's been a good day as we reflected upon the Lord and His sacrifice. As we dwelled upon the most significant event in all of human history, it's been a good day, we're going to be opening up God's word at this time and looking at a portion of his word, in Colossians, chapter four, if you want to go ahead and open your Bibles to Colossians chapter four.

It is not an uncommon occurrence in our house, for the doorknob to start rattling. And if you have littles in the house, and you probably know what I'm talking about. When they get old enough to reach the door, they know that that door opens. And so if they're on the other side, they get on that and they start rattling, even though they can't always open it. So I'll be sitting on my desk and I hear the the door rattling it'll rattle for several times. And it's usually followed by especially if the door they can't get the door open just this, exasperation, this frustration, open the door. They don't say that, but you can tell that's exactly what they want. Open the door. Well, I feel like Paul was saying something similar and Colossians chapter four, as he says that we need to pray that God would open the door for the word. So I'd like to talk for just a few moments this morning about an open door for the word and open door for the word. Let's begin by simply reading verses two through six. says continue steadfastly in prayer, being watchful in it with thanksgiving. At the same time, pray also for us that God may open to us a door for the word, to declare the mystery of Christ on account of which I am in prison, that I may make it clear, which is how I ought to speak. Walk in wisdom toward outsiders making the best use of the time, let your speech always be gracious Season with salt, so that you may know how you ought to answer each person. This section in verses two through six really forms a conclusion to the body or the thought of the letter. Now after this, he's going to give some greetings as these mentions particular people. So I've seen that there's really kind of two conclusions. But this is the conclusion of his thought. And he actually revisits some of the things that he opened with, and that is with prayer with thanksgiving, with concern for others. And with the proclamation of the Word. He began his prayer at the beginning, as he often does, or his prayer blessing. He says, I, I thank God for you. I thank God when I remember you constantly in prayer. And so he prayed for them. And one of the things he was thankful for was the truth that they had been taught, just as that truth had gone out into all of the world. And so you see, he comes back to those things, he comes back to those things. It also makes sense because in the beginning of this book, he talks about the fact that there are some that are teaching that you need something else besides Christ, you need something more than Christ to be complete. Maybe it was some kind of knowledge or ascetic practice, you need something else. Christ is a good first step, but you need something else. And Paul says that is absolutely false. Christ is sufficient. Christ is what we need, not Christ, plus, not Christ, and but Christ is what we need. toward the latter part. Part of the book, he gets into some more practical matters. And there's almost a climax or a crescendo we see in chapter three and verse 17. And what she says, and whatever you do, in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord, allow your entire beam to be consumed with God and his activity, follow after Him in all things, and he's going to spell out some of that, and give some practical advice when it comes to dealing with husbands and wives. And, and he's, even as he continues on into chapter four and verse two, I go that I go through that to show you that in in chapter four, verses two through six, it's very fitting that he uses these words, both as a conclusion of his overall point. And also continuing the idea when he says, do all things in the name of the Lord, word or deed. So notice what he says in chapter four and verse to

Jeremy Sweets  06:00
continue steadfastly in prayer, being watchful in it with thanksgiving. So the first thing he says to do is pray about it. Now he's going to make a specific case of prayer and verse three, but he starts off with this overarching, general statement. And he says, continue steadfastly and prayer wave, it's the New American Standard, maybe some other versions say, be devoted to prayer or Devote yourselves to prayer. This is more than, say a prayer. But this is a constant, persistent devotion. Just as he said in Colossians, 317, whatever you do, let that be something that envelops you that that is over all of your life. Whatever you do here he says, The Christian has to be one that is a prayerful person, consistently, persistently, prayerful, devotedly prayerful. And so he says, continue steadfastly in prayer, being watchful in it with thanksgiving. What great advice here, three short words, but it's so impactful for us to consider, pray, pray consistently, he goes on to say then to be watchful in it. And also with thanksgiving, the watch, will we see it elsewhere, and Jesus told his disciples to be watchful when it came to sin and temptation, and be alert so that you would not fall into those things. And that could certainly be the idea. But it also may be a continuation of this idea of prayer. And we see that throughout here. It may be this this rhythm of prayer in which we, we utter our requests to God, we watch for how he will answer those things. And then once we see how he answers those things, we utter Thanksgiving. And so that needs to be the way prayer works and off, right? Sometimes we pray to God and we want to forget about it, then, God do this for me. But here, Paul says, continue steadfastly in prayer, being watchful in it with thanksgiving. Now he has a specific case in mind in verse three, that's to be a general frame of mind for the Christian. And in verse three says, and at the same time, pray also for us, that God may open to us a door for the word, to declare the mystery of Christ on account of which I am in prison. I wasn't able to be in Conrad and Kurt's class on Wednesday night, but as Mark even mentioned, as we think about what is important to us, that comes out in how we spend our time and how we spend our money. It can also come out in prayer, can it? What is it that we pray about? Now, there's lots of personal requests that we can and should be making to God about ourselves, but that should not not be the totality of our prayer. There are others to consider. And there are important things important for the kingdom of God and a worldwide scale that we need to be praying about. And Paul says here, pray also for us that God may open up to us a door for the word. And so he says, Pray about it. So when we're thinking about when we're thinking about evangelism and spreading the word, the first thing we need to do is pray about it. That's what Paul requested. The next thing he talks about is that you need or he intends to proclaim it. Proclaim it And so you see this at the end of verse three and continue on in verse four. He says, to declare the mystery of Christ on account of which I'm in prison, that I may make it clear, which is how I ought to speak. You notice anything in Paul's words there, what he's asking them to do. He says, Pray that I would have an opportunity to preach the word. That's the very reason I'm in prison.

Jeremy Sweets  10:28
He wants to continue to do the very thing that had put him into prison. In fact, his greatest frustration was not some personal squabble of discomfort. But rather that prison I think he felt like hampered his efforts in preaching the gospel. And so he was not concerned with the fact that he was imprisoned, but rather, that he could continue to preach and proclaim the gospel. He says in verse four that I make, make it clear, which is how I ought to speak. Paul is continually throughout his letters, trying to emphasize God's word, and not himself as the messenger. He's not wanting to have flowery speech and to be impressive to others so that they would back away and say, Paul, you're such a great speaker. Now, he didn't want the emphasis on himself. But he says, I want the word to be spoken clearly. so that others can understand. Paul says, Pray that there will be opportunities for the word, so that I can proclaim the Word. He goes on in verse five, to say that it's something that should not only be prayed about and proclaimed, but also practiced. He says in verse five, walk in wisdom toward outsiders making the best use of the time. Now, first of all, walking in wisdom with outsiders, is going to be done in a godly way. If we're to walk in a wise manner with outsiders, we're going to walk in a way that is consistent with our message. It would be completely unwise to preach Christ and godliness, and then display an ungodly life, or an uncommitted life. So the first thing we see here is a consistent life, a godly live. But I think more than that, we see in verse five, he says, Walk in wisdom toward outsiders, making the best use of the time. It's not only how we have our personal lives, but what are we going to do with others. Walking wisely with others is seeking to always shift attention to God. You know, there's lots of things that we can do with others, that may be good or innocence. But we should have in our minds that we want to point others to Christ. And so we should never seek to have a friendship that we simply cut off Christ from our thoughts. Say, I just want to have a good time with this person. Again, you can have a good time you can enjoy that relationship. But our goal should be in pointing people to Christ, because that is wise. And why should we do that in verse five, he says, because we are to make the best use of the time. When we realize our time is limited. We can't let all of our time be consumed with with hobbies and sports and conversation of, of temporal matters that will pass away. There are more foundational, Fundamental Matters that we need to get to. And we need to make the best use of our time and walk wisely. He says in verse six, that were also to present it with grace. So it's not only in our actions, but also in our speech, let your speech always be gracious Season with salt, so that you may know how you ought to answer each person. Have you ever tried to do something the right way? My guess is you probably have and this could be anything, whether it be driving or cooking or anything like that. Do you look down on others because they don't do it the right way. You know, we're supposed to be getting in line here in traffic. There's all these people zooming past and trying to cut it that is not the right way. You know, and I look over and say, That is wrong. I look down on them. And I say that with a smile on my face. But maybe you get the seriousness of the point whether it'd be that or something else. I think sometimes we can do that when it comes to the gospel is people aren't doing what's right. And we look down on them. Truth is, that will come out in our speech, that kind of dismissive attitude, that kind of really pride, that that attitude that looks down on others. But here he says, Don't be dismissive or harsh or judgmental, but rather, let your speech be gracious and calm. And, you know,

Jeremy Sweets  15:29
I'm very short sighted. You know, it may be that, that I used to do something wrong for a long time. And as soon as I learned the right thing to do, then everybody else should just step in line, right? Everybody else should be where I am. And I forget the fact that maybe this took me a while. And oh, yeah, there's lots of other areas that I need help in. So we need to extend graciousness and kindness and our speech to others. When Paul talks about an open door for the word, he says, first of all, pray about it. Second of all, to proclaim it to speak His word. Not only that, but you need to have a consistent life in which you practice it. And you you act in wisdom toward others taking advantage of the time and the opportunities, and forth, he says that you are to present it with grace. And so how are we treating our opportunities with the word? What are we doing with our opportunities for the word? Well, I'd like as a case, an example to look at Jesus and the woman at the well. I think when we see how he interacted with the woman at the well, we can see that Jesus took advantage of opportunities, and we need to be doing the same thing. Now all of these might not happen for us with the same person, but I want to look at principles that he used, and see if we can apply those things to our lives. Are we asking and looking for an open door for the word? So turn it over to John chapter for John chapter four. As we look at Jesus and the woman at the well. There are so many opportunities to proclaim the gospel today. And so along with our prayers for open doors, we need to be watchful for its member in in Colossians, four and verse to be consistent, steadfast in prayer, being watchful. We need to do the same thing when it comes to our opportunities. So notice, John, for in verses seven through nine, the first thing that Jesus did was that he made a new acquaintance, he made a new acquaintance, we see in verses seven through nine, says a woman from Samaria came to draw water. Jesus said to her, give me a drink. first disciples had gone away into the city to buy food. The Samaritan woman said to it, how is it that you do ask for a drink from me? A woman of Samaria? For Jews have no dealings with Samaritan? You'll notice first of all, that this woman had many strikes against her. First of all, she was a Samaritan. No, the Jews, as it says in the text did not normally have dealings with Samaritans. Samaritans were those that had intermediate married with Gentiles. And so their ancestors had intermarried with with Gentiles. And so by that they were they were impure when it came to their marriage. Not only that, but they seem to borrow elements of the religion around them, so that they mix their religion, they were wrong religiously. Not only that, but she says that I am a woman of Samaria. At this time, there was a social order. And those that were women were ranked below men. And so she didn't fit the bills, another strike against her. Not only that, but we see that she came in about the sixth hour. And you see that in verse six. That was the mid day. Now, normally water was was,

Jeremy Sweets  19:22
was gotten at the beginning of the day, for the chores of the day. And so it may be that she came in the middle of the day when no one else was. It may be that she was here a social outcast, someone that was pushed to the side and she was not part of the regular rhythm of society. So she came at midday. That may be the case. She was also we see a moral. She was one who had had five husbands we're going to learn later and the one she was with was not her husband. But as you look at it Jesus, even though Jews did not normally deal with Samaritans, Jesus did not allow that to prevent him from talking to her. Even though their ancestors had fused a different religion or elements of religion in and they had the wrong religion, Jesus didn't let that prevent him from talking to her. Even though women were considered to be on a lower scale than men, Jesus didn't allow her gender or social standing to prevent him from talking to her. Even though she may have been an outcast from society, you'll see the pattern here. Jesus did not allow that to prevent him from talking to her, even though she was sexually immoral. Within your ungodly life, Jesus did not let her sins prevent him from talking to her, and she was surprised by it. Are you talking to me? So what does this have to do with us and opportunities for the word? Well, we need to be speaking to other people. And one of the ways that opportunities come is through new acquaintances. Talking to other people taking an interest in others, we need to be doing that and those that are most pushed to the side and the least talked to may be the most receptive, and the most appreciative that you would take the time to talk to them. So we need to be talking to others. I'll just step aside here and say, this is something that I want to work on. When I talk about evangelism. You know, it's a pretty standard sermon for preachers, right? They talk about spreading the word we all need to do that. I fear too often in my life, I've heard that lesson. I've gotten immediately excited, but it's not taken root the way it needs to. And maybe you feel the same way. I don't know. I can only speak for myself here. I want to push myself to talk to more people. And I'll just tell you right now, that's not easy for me. Let me let me shamefully tell you this, maybe I shouldn't have so much emphasis on myself. But I go to the why on my lunches. I've been doing that and Brit wood for about eight or nine years bestline tail probably three or four times a week. That's what I do. I haven't always been consistent in that. I've probably had nine conversations in those nine years.

Jeremy Sweets  22:31
That makes me want to cry.

Jeremy Sweets  22:39
I need to be talking to more people. It's easy for me to put my head down. It's easy for me to put my head down and do my thing. That's what other people are doing with why they go I'm not saying we have to go into our long conversations with everyone we meet. But I hope in nine years, we're having more than nine conversations. Okay, I'm gonna push myself on that. And I hope that you are seeking to talk to more people make new acquaintances take an interest in others. Also, we see that Jesus talked about relevant topics, do you Jesus spoke to this woman about something that was important to her and that was water, living water. Now she was making her trip to get water. And Jesus says there is living water, this water is not something that you have to go and get. But I imagined she was first thinking about a stream, maybe something that would come to her not something well, that you would have to go and get. And so we see here that Jesus begins to talk about something that was important to her something that was relevant. I think there are many opportunities today in which we will talk about relevant topics. I think that's what we're trying to do with with Don Patton and the Gospel, meaning something that people are going to be interested in. And so if you're thinking about origins, and you're thinking about archaeology, Is the Bible True? I think that's something on people's mind. And so we can say, we can talk to others. So this is something you might be interested in. It's also true that the news can be a great opportunity. In the news, when I go into my break room, they have I don't know CNN or they have different news sites just on the TV and going all the time. And as I walk in there, here's some of the things I hear about the me to movement and sexual harassment. I hear about the murder of a cop in Dixon. I hear about human trafficking. I hear about the homosexual agenda. And all of this is spoken when I'm in there with other people After hearing some of the same things, now, when sins are discussed, I'm not saying, you know, we can always just start talking about a long conversation on human trafficking. But can we pose questions? Or can we mentioned something about a relevant topic that would push their mind to spiritual things? Do you think that's right, we can show disgust for for the immorality that is there, you know, there is a need for God. We can say something like that, that is diminished. And so we can talk to relevant topics. And here you need to use your imagination, do what you can, as you think about ways to engage others, Jesus, the master teacher, did that. He did that. And so we need to be thinking about and seeking relevant topics on people's mind. Jesus also encountered someone that was ready to listen, she was ready to listen in verses 15 through 1815, through 18, the woman said to him, Sir, give me this water so that I may not be thirsty and have to come here to draw water. Jesus said to go call your husband and come here, the woman answered him, I have no husband, Jesus said to her, you are right in saying I have no husband, for you have had five husbands, and the one you now have is not your husband, what you have said is true. There was an old song that said, looking for love and all the wrong places. We could alter that a little bit, I think we would describe this woman and many people in the world. And that is looking for fulfillment, and happiness. And yes, probably you can include love in that, in all the wrong places, be known anyone like this. If I just had a boyfriend, if I just had a husband, I would be cared for, I would be somebody. And without that foundation of their own person, they often find the wrong thing. And they go from one to the next. But they're always seeking and searching. Doesn't that describe the world today? If I had a new job, if I had a new boat, if I could reach this level in my retirement account, if I could go ahead and retire early, my life would be where it needs to be.

Jeremy Sweets  27:30
But Jesus caught someone here that it was painfully obvious to her that she did not have the fulfillment and satisfaction in life that she wanted. And that's because she was looking in all the wrong places. Do you know we have opportunities for the word today when we find people that are ready to listen. So let me give you a couple of ways that happens. First of all, there are people that undergo that are undergoing a change in their circumstances. And that may be family, they may be newly married, they may have a birth of a child, they may be going through a divorce, it could be at work with a new job, or loss of a job. It could be with their health in their home, maybe they have a new home, moving to a new location. Maybe they're dealing with illness, the death of someone close to them, the death of a friend or family. All these things, shake people down. So that they are ready to listen, they may have been dismissive of God and His Word, completely every other time. But when you're confronted with your mortality, when you see the death of a friend, you may be more ready to listen. And so if we're looking for opportunities for the word, it's often or I've never seen this, you're sitting there, someone tapped you on the shoulder and said, Can you tell me how to become a Christian with no contact? That's not how the opportunities come. But if we would be watchful, we can be ready to listen, as people talk about these things in their life. Another thing I heard about was the three knots. And so sometimes when we talk about evangelism, we feel like we need this whole system and I don't know I don't have my nine step plan, you know, my nine hour study to go through them with, you know, I just can't do this until I've got everything in place. Jesus often talked with people and steer them toward the conversation. So the three knots, anytime you hear people say one of these three things, then you need to automatically invite them to church or to a Bible study. Let's see if we can do this. The first one is that it is not going well. You ever heard anybody saying that? Hey, how's it going? Not too well. We need to respond to that. Would you like to come to church with me? Automatically? Would you like to have a Bible study with me? The second one is I was not ready or I was not prepared for that. Really well. Would you like to come to church with me? Would you like to go and worship or study the Bible? And the third one is, I am not. From here. I'm new to the area. So if we would listen, people, it's almost like opportunities are thrown at us. But we're not always. I'm not always watchful for them. And so we can use these three knots, it is not going well, I was not prepared for that or expecting that. I am not from here. Maybe those people are ready to listen. They're ready to listen, Jesus found a woman that was ready to listen. And I'm not saying everyone we find or talk to is going to be ready to listen. But I do know that you're not going to find that out unless you do talk to. Okay. We also see that Jesus engaged her curiosity. He talked to her in such a way that she began to ask questions. Questions are a great way to engage curiosity, what do you think about this? What do you think about often we want to go in with our again, nine step plan hours and hours of teaching that we can do and that's appropriate? I'm not mocking that. But what I am saying is that sometimes questions, get them thinking, sometimes questions, engages their curiosity, so they have to answer that for themselves. Many of you have looked at a book called muscle in the shovel. And one of the Randall in that book is one that asked questions. You ask questions, what do you think about? And he asked him about Bible pasts.

Jeremy Sweets  32:07
That is a great model, that we can ask others questions about Scripture. And you'll pretty quickly see those that want to engage in those that say, I don't I don't care anything about that. And maybe we wait for another opportunity. But we need to be people that are asking questions, engaging curiosity. Paul did this in Acts chapter 17. There was a god's all over the place. And he says, You know what I can tell you about the unknown God. Now in a polytheistic society, people's ears start to hurt. Oh, what are you talking about? You know, we talked about things all the time and the gods that are here and for Tim to talk about an unknown god would have piqued their interest and their curiosity. Later in Acts chapter 17. It says some sneered at him when he talked about the resurrection. They were dismissive, this guy doesn't know anything, but others were curious and wanted to hear more from him. Maybe we can take advantage of opportunities by asking questions by engaging curiosity. Jesus concluded by revealing himself, she makes the statement in verse 25. She says, I know the Messiah is coming. He who is called Christ, when He comes, He will tell us all things. Jesus said to her I who speak to you am, I am he, we see that Jesus pointed to himself. And that's what we need to be doing. Not pointing to ourselves, but pointing to Christ. That should be the ultimate goal is that we would point others to Christ. Jesus showed us with the woman at the well how we can take advantage of opportunities and how opportunities come our way to talk about the gospel. And we can do that by making new acquaintances by talking to others by talking about relevant topics by listening for those that may be in a situation where they are ready to listen, by engaging curiosity and by ultimately pointing to Christ. Well, let me conclude with some some lessons in which we might make application and this more or less will be a review of what we have already said. There's so much we can talk about when it comes to being evangelistic. First thing is that we need to recognize the great need. This is something that should never leave our minds. We need to be consistent and recognizing what a great need there is for the gospel message. It is what can save people. It is what can deliver people from their sin and the heartache that comes from that sin. It is more important than a cure to cancer. It is far more important than winning the lottery. It is more important than anything else in this life. And so many people are drowning without it. It's like they're in the waters, bobbing, seeking some air, wanting life raft, wanting something to pull them up. And we have the gospel message. We have the gospel message. Now I don't want this lesson again just to turn into a guilt trip. But we should never allow the importance of the gospel to escape our mind. We should never allow the great need of the gospel to slip from our minds. And if we pray regularly about it, I think that will help. If this is a constant part of our prayer, that we would pray for an open door for the word. If we would pray for opportunities. If we would go to our God and heaven, the creator, and ask for opportunities, I believe that he will give those to us. And so not only do we need to pray, but we need to be watchful for those opportunities. Far too often, we pray and then shut our minds. Give me patience. You know, I just hope he's asked me with patience. Give me an opportunity to preach the gospel, please have someone tapped me on the shoulder and say, I don't know anything about you. But maybe you can tell me about Christ. That's not how those things happen. Okay. God, in His wisdom, in his power and strength, can prevent present opportunities for us. But we need to be watchful for them. We need to be aware and listening.

Jeremy Sweets  36:51
We also need to just do it. I've heard Mike talk about this several times. When it comes to evangelism, we often feel overwhelmed. I mean, I already gave five points of opportunity to look for, you know, which 1am I doing, I get flustered, I forget about this, and that I don't have all the study set up. I'm not prepared to teach a study. And so the easiest thing and I'll tell you this is the truth, the easiest thing is just to do nothing. But that's not the helpful thing, or the good thing. And so instead of fretting over having everything in place, do something. Do something in Matthew 10 and verse 42. Now, Matthew 10 is the limited commission Jesus sends His apostles out. And so the whole chapter is about going out and preaching and proclaiming the gospel. And in chapter 10, and verse 42, the last section of verses there, he says, and whoever in the name of a disciple gives to one of these little ones, even a cup of cold water to drink, truly I say to you, he shall not lose his reward. We are dismissive of small things. And we want to be like Peter and boast of great things we will do. But often, it's the small things that matter. A simple invitation or a word, a question. And so you might not can do everything. I don't know how many people here would raise their hands and feel fully prepared to answer any question they're coming away or, or, or be fully prepared for, for a study. We need to maybe be working toward that. But my advice would be do something. Do what you can challenge yourself and say, You know what, I'm going to ask two people. If you're not talking anybody to is more than than that, isn't it? We're gonna ask two people to the gospel meeting. I've been encouraged on this lesson. Gary Fisher, we all know Gary Fisher. He's at Hillview this week. And so I was able to catch a couple of his sessions. And he talked, he's talking on Matthew, hit chapter 10. And one of the sessions where I was there. But he talked about their congregation is making an emphasis on evangelism this year. I guess it's their theme. I don't know if he worded it like that. But they have something on their board, where they said, as a group, we're going to talk to 40 people this month. And so people go and if they talk to somebody, they put a notch on there. And when you think about a million people in Nashville, it can get overwhelming and you can begin to say, I can't do this. The easiest thing is to do nothing. But we need to challenge ourselves and encourage each other and be persistent in prayer and be watchful for opportunity so that we would push ourselves to do more than we are so that we can do something. Handing a cup of cold water makes a difference. Asking a question Russian speaking up, maybe I can talk to five people in the coming year at the why? Maybe I can, maybe I can make steps in which I'm engaging others. So that's easier for some of you than others. But whoever you are, I think you can push yourself. Because it's simply that important. It's worth doing. It's worth doing. Maybe you're here this morning and you're not a Christian. We're going to sing an invitation song. And this invitation song is going to tell you about God's invitation that you can make your life right this very day by becoming a Christian, if you're not one, believing that Jesus is the Christ, repenting of your sins and confessing Jesus as the Son of God, by turning your life away from sin, and committing yourself to live a godly life, being baptized into Christ Jesus and being raised to walk in newness of life. It may be that you're here this morning and you are a Christian and you're not living as you should. The church has given as an encouragement and if you need to come forward and ask for prayers, or even talk to your neighbor after the end of the prayer and say, Would you pray for me for this? Please do whatever you can to make your life right today. There's any subject to the invitation. Please come as we stand and sing at this time.
