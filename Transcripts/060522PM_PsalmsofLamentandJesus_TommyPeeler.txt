Open your Bibles if you would, to Psalm 69. Psalm 69. I will tell you in advance that Lord willing, tomorrow night, we want to look at Psalm eight. And we're going to talk about psalms of praise, and about how Jesus fulfills these psalms of praise using Psalm eight as an example. Psalm 69, as we look at tonight, is a psalm that's classified as a Psalm of lament. Actually, this is the most common type of Saul, an individual a man is an individual pours out their heart pours out their grief, and pours out their pain to God. We stated that the psalms are man's message to God, men pouring out their heart to God, but the psalms are also God's message to man. God is instructing us when we have difficulty and when we face problems. What ways are acceptable in which to pour out our heart to him is Psalm 69 is an illustration of this. We will to look at the psalm in context. Now, you understand that there's so much more in each of these psalms than we can begin to scratch the surface of we just can't began to touch upon all that is so important within the law to see a few things, hopefully to motivate you to further study and also to see how they point to Jesus. But in Psalm 69 Let's begin by reading the first 12 verses the heading says, For the choir director according to shush, Janine, this psalm of David saved me, oh God, for the waters have threatened my life. I have sunk into deep mire and there is no foothold. I have come into deep waters and a flood overflows me, I am weary with my crying, my throat is parched, my eyes fail while I wait for my God. Those who hate me without a coals are more than the hairs of my head. Those who would destroy me are powerful, being wrongfully my enemies what I did not steal, I didn't have to restore. Oh God, it is you who knows my folly, and my wrongs are not hidden from you. May those who wait for you not be ashamed through me, or to post those who seek you not be dishonored through me, oh God of Israel, because for your sake, I have borne reproach. This honor has covered my face. I have become estranged from my brother's an alien to my father, mother's sons, for zeal for your house has consumed me and the approaches of those who approach you have fallen on me. When I wept in my soul with fasting, I became, it became my reproach. When I made sackcloth, my clothing, I became a by word to them. Those who sit in the gate talk about me, and I am the soul of drunkards. It is hard for me to relate adequately in teaching this. How pain field, how emotion field, this army is. In verses one and two, if we were to take their verse one, if we were to take that first and wanting to have your take literally that he sink into the deep mire, and there's no place for a foothold, if I was asked to apply that literally to a biblical character, I would originally say, Well, maybe John, it sounds like he is drowning in the midst of the sea. That's not a literal description. But it is a description that we can relate to. We often use the language that we're drowning to talk about an event that happens while we're completely on dry land and that's the way he is here. And he may Ah, this statement, I'm weary with my crying, my throat is parched, my eyes fail. While I wait for my god

Unknown Speaker  05:12
I admit the language that I have on the slide, he is so weary with crying he cannot cry anymore is not actually the language of the tags. It is the essence of the tags was several years ago, I saw someone that I believe was falsely accused and wronged, a brother who faced that situation among other brethren. And I remember recalling him and trying to sympathize with him. And he said, I've cried, and I've cried.

Unknown Speaker  06:02
So I couldn't cry anymore. That statement would be more meaningful. If you knew the person who said it, he was a very tough man.

Unknown Speaker  06:17
He had spent some time in prison. And yet, he talked about the pain in that situation and caused him. If you've experienced pain like that, if you've experienced that kind of hurt, this song is for you. As it gives you instruction as to how to approach God in the midst of those kinds of circumstances. In those situations where you feel like the waters are closing in on you in those circumstances, where you feel that you have cried your last here. This song gives you instruction as to how to approach God. Also some things that we see about the psalmist is that his enemies are many. His enemies are powerful. And his enemies are enemies in spite of what he's done, not because of what he's done, is you look at verse four, he says those who hate me without a coals are more than the hairs of my head in Psalm 40. In verse 12, our sins are sometimes said to be more than the hairs of our head. That kind of phrase is also used for God's blessing in God's goodness to us in the song, but here it is used for his enemies, he has more enemies than he can count his enemies are many his enemies are powerful as the text tells us and he says they are wrongfully my enemies. It is not as if he has deserved this through something roll that he has done. Forget what verse 18 says, verse 18, oh, draw near to my soul and redeem it, Ransom me because of my enemy. So again, speaks of his enemies. In a plural they are many, he is begging for deliverance from his enemies. So as he pours out his heart, he faces many enemies, and it is hard to find a friend. Look at verse eight, I have been estranged from my brothers, and an alien to my mother's sons. Let me ask you to look at that text and just want to make a couple of observations about it. The most common feature of Hebrew poetry is parallelism, where the second line, basically reemphasize is the first line is synonymous. It is it says basically the same thing, synonymous parallelism, but usually, the second line adds a little intensity to the first line. Let me illustrate. In verse eight. I become estranged from my brothers and alien to my mother's sons. There were provisions in the Old Testament for a man having more than one wife, Deuteronomy 21, verses 15 through 17 Talk about it. I don't know how to answer all the questions that are involved in that But sometimes men were brothers, because they had the same father, but not the same mother. So he adds an element of intensity to this. Not only is he estranged from his brothers, he's an alien to his mother's sons. Not only do they share the same father, they share the same father and mother and yet still he is alienated from them. We'll talk about verse 12, in a moment, but in verses 19 through 21, you know, my reproach and my shame, and my dishonor. And all my adversaries are before you reproach has broken my heart, and I am so sick, and I look for sympathy, and there was none.

Unknown Speaker  10:55
And for comforters and there was none. They also gave me gold for my food. And for my thirst, they gave me vinegar to drink. You notice the repetition in verse 20, of that phrase, but there was none. He is looking for some kind of sympathy. He is looking for some kind of comfort. He's looking for some kind of support. But he's nowhere. You he's nowhere to be found. It is hard to find. A friend is hard to find a friend. And the reason he is dishonored. The reason he is shamed you is because of his loyalty to God and his loyalty to God's word. Look at verse, look at verse seven. Says, for years say, I have borne reproach for your say, dishonor has covered my face, in verse nine zeal for your house has consumed me, and the reproaches of those who approach you have fallen upon Me. Because of you. I have bought her approach people despise him because of his love for God because in verse nine of his zeal for God's house, and those who reproach God in those who would speak against God, and those who would mock God, they mock him. In anything he does, in service to God is mocked and ridiculed. In verse 10. When I wept in my soul with fasting, it became my reproach. When I made sackcloth, my clothing, I became a byword to him. When he weeps, when he wears sackcloth, all of these signs of boarding, whatever he does, they mock Him, they ridiculed him. In verse 12, which we said we would deal with in a moment, those who sit in a gay, talk about me and I in the song of drunkards, I want you to look at that verse for just a moment. And I want to make a couple of observations. Genesis 19, lat is sitting in the gate of Sodom. What's that indicates? The virtuous woman of Proverbs 31. Her husband is known in the game. Was that me? You remember when Boaz wanted to conduct business? In route four, he went to the city gate. The city gate was where all important business was done. The city gate was where the important people sat and render judgment. The city gate was the place for the leaders of the town. And here the psalmist says David says, Those who sit in the gate, those who sit in the gate, talk about me, and I have a song of drunkards. Verse 12, is what we would call a mare ism. It is a contrast. It takes the highest, the most important the most significant those who sit in the gate And then he takes the lowest, those who are drunkards. But whether you were one of the highest in town, or whether you were one of the lowest, whether you were one of the important people in town who had clout, or whether you were a drunk wallowing in the street, you he was bought by everyone. Maybe you've done something at work, to take a stand for what's right, to take a stand for some biblical principle of morality. And because of it,

Unknown Speaker  15:46
you're opposed. And you walk into a room, and everyone stops talking. And you get a pretty good idea that they were all mocking you, because of your stand for right? And your stand for truth. That's the way the Psalm has failed. It's difficult to find a friend. And the reason it's difficult to find a friend is because he is dishonored for God's sake. Now, I want to just briefly touch upon the next couple of points. He asked God to judge his foes in verses 22 through 20, A, and he is confident at the end of the Psalm that God will give him victory. You notice in verse 22, that this song as some of the psalms of lament, this song of woman pours out his grief and pours out his pain to God, and begs God to judge his enemies. Now, we are not going to talk about that idea as extensively tonight. Lord willing this week, we may try to deal with that particular concept in practice Kotori Psalms, calling down judgment on someone else. What does that show us? What does it teach us? Is that something that we should ever do in any kind of circumstance today, and I want you to read verses 22 through 25, to just give you a feeling of what these words are, like, make their table before the old become a snare. And when they are in peace, not yet become a trap. May their eyes grow dealroom so that they cannot see and make their loins shake continually pour out your indignation on them, and may your burning anger overtake them. May their camp be desolate, it may none dwell in their tents. He's asking God to judge them to judge the home in a way that they have judged his home. In verse 21, they gave him a home goal for his food and vinegar for his drink. And he asked in verse 22, that their table will become a snare just as they have withheld food for me, may you bring judgment on the film in this area. And it is very normal for these psalms to end on a note of praise. Listen to verses 34 through 36, God, heaven and earth, praise him, the seas and everything that moves in them, for God will save Zion and build the cities of Judah, that they may dwell there and possess it, the descendants of His servants will inherit it, and those who love His name will dwell in it, he is confident that ultimately God will work things out, and that this will end in victory. Now, we haven't hardly scratched the surface of anything in Psalm 69. And I want to tell you something, and it's always going to benefit you more are one of our purposes in coming together in studying and reading His word is that you might pursue these things more individually, and you may reflect over them and think about the more and read the Psalms over and over again. But I want to also at this time, call attention to something else. Many of you have already probably picked up that a lot of this language that's used in Psalm 69 is used in the New Testament and apply to Jesus. For example, Just as the psalmist said, those who hate me without a cold, are more than the hairs of my head. Jesus refers to this in John 1525, telling his disciples that he is many who are his enemies without a coals.

Unknown Speaker  20:21
Look at verse nine, for zeal for your house has consumed me. Do you remember in John chapter two, when Jesus went into the temple and he cleanse the temple, the Bible tells us when He cleansed the temple and drove out the money changers, that the disciples remembered the Scripture, zeal for your house, will consume me that remember that passage of Scripture, though the full understanding of all these events, does not exactly come until Jesus has been raised from the dead, but zeal for your house will consume me it is Jesus zeal for God's house in God's temple that leads him to cleanse that house. And it leads to more intense opposition from the religious leaders. And their approach is looking at the last part of that bursts. The approaches of those who approached you have fallen upon me, that is quoted in Romans 15 And verse three, and applied to Jesus. There are approaches of those who approached you have fallen upon me all who hated God,

Unknown Speaker  21:43
very their wrath upon Christ. In verse 21, they gave me gold for my food, and for my thirst, they gave me vinegar. You remember, in John 19, that Jesus cries out, I thirst, in order to fulfill the scripture.

Unknown Speaker  22:24
And they brought him sour wine upon a branch of his syrup, and put it to his mouth. They gave him vinegar to drink. The words of John 19 Do not specifically quote any Old Testament passages. But generally it is believed because of its connection to I thirst, and then giving vinegar to drink that these words apply to Jesus. And the words that are used in verse 25. One of the reasons I wanted to read those words, may their account become desolate. May their account become desolate, and none dwell in their tents. Those words are quoted by Peter, in Acts one, verse 20, and apply to Judas, about how Judas has Judas is apostasy has fulfilled the Psalms, he quoted from Psalm 69. He quoted from Psalm 109. And he emphasizes that Judas activities have fulfilled this bad boy, Jesus is the ultimate fulfillment of this song. G Jesus is the one about whom these words could be uttered. Now, there's a limitation to what I just said. This psalm does not refer to Jesus exclusively. A reason that I can say that with confidence, is because of verse five. Oh God, it is you who knows my folly, and my roles are not hidden from you. We made the point about Psalm 41 This morning, that Psalm 41, even though it's quoted and applied to Jesus situation have been betrayed in the hands of Judas. It is not a psalm exclusively about Jesus, because in Psalm 41, the writer confess sin, you can make the same point of Psalm 69. In Psalm 69 in verse five, oh God, it is you who knows my folly and my wrongs are not hidden from you. This psalm originally refers to David and though his enemies are many and powerful, and without calls, even though they are without calls, it is not as if David has never done anything wrong. David has done wrong and David acknowledges his folly. And he says my wrongs are not hidden. But the reason he's been opposed is because he's doing what is right is because of zeal for your name.

Unknown Speaker  25:33
What I'm trying to demonstrate is this is it is fascinating to me that Jesus takes the most passionate and pain field of the Psalms. And he lives them out. He makes them his own.

Unknown Speaker  26:02
We referenced this song this morning. In our reference other versus to die. Does Jesus care? When my heart is paying too deeply for mirth and solved?

Unknown Speaker  26:27
And the burdens pres, and the cares distress, and the way grows weary and long? Does Jesus care? When my way is dark, with a nameless dread or fear? As the daylight fades into deep night shades? does he care enough to be near? Does Jesus care? When I've said goodbye to the dearest on Earth to me? And my sad heart aches, till it nearly breaks? Is it all for him? Does he see? And the chorus affirms, oh yes, he cares. I know he cares. His heart is touched with my grief. When the days are weary, and the Long Night dreary, I know. My Savior cares. I can know that song is true. Not because I feel it in my heart. But because I can read it in His Word. I can read how Jesus takes the most passionate and paying field of the Psalms, and makes them his own. When Jesus is on the crawls, if indeed, when he says I thirst is referencing Psalm 69. It would be one of three occasions on the crawls that Jesus makes reference to the Psalms. The only statement from the cross recorded in Matthew and Mark is the statement by God, My God, why have You forsaken Me? In Matthew 2746, in Mark 1534. In Luke 23, verse 46, Jesus said, into your hand, I commit my spirit, making reference to Psalm 31 And verse five. But you read the context of Psalm 22. Read the context of Psalm 31. Read the grief of these writers read the pain that they experienced, read the disappointment and brokenness that they feel and understand that Jesus quotes these words on the crawl it may be that you're now leaving one of these verses up does Jesus care if you're leaving those verses out, you can find a little comfort in the fact that he truly enter into our pain and suffering. He takes the most painful of the Psalms and makes them his own and leaves them out to demonstrate that he loves us that He cares for us that he can assist us in his troubles in our Our troubles. May God bless you and me, let us pray.

Unknown Speaker  30:12
Lord our God, you are worthy of glory, and worthy of praise. We live in a world of pain and suffering. But we are thankful that we serve a God who is no stranger to pain and suffering. For you have truly entered into our experiences in these experiences of Christ we are thankful for your compassion, we are thankful for your love, we are thankful for your sustenance in times when we are broken in times when we cannot go forward. For those Lord in this congregation, who are specially experiencing these times, right now, who may be personally walking through the valley of the shadow of death. For those who have loved ones who may be for those that are experiencing difficulties at work for those who may be persecuted,

Unknown Speaker  31:45
for doing the right thing. We find comfort in these words. But we find strength in them. May we be encouraged to live closer to you. Hold on to us in our pain and trials, and bring us home to you, in Jesus name.

Unknown Speaker  32:10
Amen. In just a moment, we're going to have her invitation so but I do want to make a point here and this is a point of interpretation. I do believe that these psalms that are quoted and apply to Jesus in the New Testament, give us a way of reading the whole Old Testament that we can apply to the rest of the Old Testament, even if that passage is not specifically quoted in the New Testament. For example, Psalm 88 Psalm 88 is one of the darkest of all Psalms may be the darkest of all the psalms of individual men. A matter of fact, most of the psalms in an unknown deprived Psalm 88 dozen. Psalm 88 has no note of hope, or no note of praise in the end its last word in Hebrew and in most English translations is the word darkness. You know very interesting response I've gotten when I've preached on Psalm 88. Psalm 88, darkness all day long. And a lot of times I have people come out and say that was so encouraging. You know why they say that? They say that, because when they see someone else express their pain. It gives them comfort, in the midst of their own pain. These psalms of lament, give us hope, in the midst of our own pain, that others have had these trials and worse and they've survived. And it reminds us that any kind of grief or lament that Jesus in some way, has experienced except grief over his own sake. And that that can give us hope, and assurance in the midst of our situation. If you want to come to Jesus tonight, if you believe Jesus died and rose again, you're willing to turn from your sins in repentance. It'd be baptized in the crowd. eyes for remission of says if you want to come to him we invite you to do so as we stay in the same

Unknown Speaker  35:08
