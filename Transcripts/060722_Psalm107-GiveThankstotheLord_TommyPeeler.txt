Unknown Speaker  00:05
and it is good to have everyone here tonight

Unknown Speaker  00:07
we appreciate particularly those who are visiting with us. But Psalm 107 is generally classified as a Psalm of thanksgiving. Something we haven't discussed previously and just mention quickly tonight is that the Psalms had been divided into five books for a long time. In the first couple of books of Psalms and in there, there's some characteristics of these the first couple of books of Psalms many of the Psalms most of the psalms are viewed as Psalms of David are described as Psalms of David psalms of individual lament are strong is an individual is pouring out his heart, in the midst of his problems to God. In the third book of Psalms, Psalms 73 through 89, this book it besides is more national lament is the is the writers born some great national catastrophe. You see this particularly in Psalm 74, Psalm 79, would be examples of this book, for it begins, interestingly, after Psalm 89, ask what happened to your promises to David, Psalm 90 opens Before the mountains were born, or you gave birth to the earth, even from everlasting to everlasting you are God. And the fact that God is King is stressed in a lot of those psalms particularly 93. Through 99, Psalms 107 to 150. The Book of Psalms has a lot of praises, lot of Thanksgiving, a lot of praises, not much personal lament. Let me say this, because I believe it's important but it's, let me say it clearly want you to think about it. I don't know if I stressed this well enough Sunday night, when we were dealing with Psalm 69, in psalms of lament, but generally those psalms move from lament to praise. For example, a good illustration is Psalm 30. Psalm 13, the first four verses, the writer pours out his grief, the writer pours out his pain, the writer begs God to act quickly, or he's going to die. But then in verses five and six, there's a sudden shift in the mood, and he has gone from lament to praising God. Most every one of the psalms of individual lament, end on a note of phrase, that is true for the individual Psalms. That is true for the Psalms as a whole, as a whole, in the arrangement of the book, if you start with Psalm one, and read through some 150, there is a heavy emphasis on psalms of lament and mourning in the beginning of the Psalms, and a heavy emphasis on praise at the end, Psalms 145 through 150, or Psalms surprise. Now, we could make some points about that. But I would suggest one thing for God's people, that is the way history is moving. Now we live in a time of trials and troubles and tribulation, but history is moving to culminate in praise. We could have dealt with that a lot more a lot longer. And in here is another outline of Psalm 107. But let me tell you something, even if I have one of these slides on the board, even if it is only there for just a couple of seconds, you will be accountable for it on the test. So I just want you to know that but but here is kind of an outline of this, of this song. We're going to particularly focus on verses four through 32. Four through 32. But I want to lists as we read the first three verses, if you want to make a point of that you want to make a note of that outline. I hope you get time to if you want to take a picture of it, but it's nothing you could not get on your own. I hope I'm doing it to hopefully help you study a little bit for the Psalms.

Unknown Speaker  04:53
Remember last night we talked about how the previous song had closed? Look at some 106 Verse 47, save us, oh Lord our God, and gather us from among the nations to give thanks to your holy name and glory, to your praise. Gather us from among the nations to give thanks to you, and glory in your praise. What we see as Psalm 107 opens is that is the case, Psalm 1071 through three, oh, give thanks to the Lord, for He is good. For his loving kindness is everlasting. Let the redeemed of the Lord say so whom He has redeemed from the hand of the adversary, and gathered from the lands from the east and from the west, from the north, and from the south. Now, the way this psalm begins, oh, give thanks to the Lord, for He is good for his loving kindness is everlasting. This is a way that several of the Psalms started 106 118 136 All began that way. And so that is a common expression, give thanks to the Lord, for He is good for his loving kindness is everlasting. And here are other points in Israel's history, where we see that soul song, give thanks to the Lord, for He is good. His loving kindness is everlasting. We see the time of David, when they're moving the Ark to Jerusalem, we see the completion of the temple and Second Chronicles five and the days of Solomon, it's prophesied that when they returned from captivity, in Jeremiah 33, they will sing this song, and in Ezra chapter three in verse 11, when the foundation of the Second Temple is laid around 535 BC or so, the Bible says they sing the soul, we can trace this song, give thanks to the Lord, for He is good for his loving kindness is everlasting, just in those verses for at least 500 years. This was a favorite film of Israel for a long, long time. Now, a couple of things about these first verses, the word loving kindness is going to be a key word in Psalm 107. Loving Kindness is a key word in the Old Testament, is you Psalm 245 times, but those 245 times over half of those slightly over half, are in the book of Psalms. So the book of Psalms more than any book is going to emphasize the loving kindness of the Lord. Notice the last verse of the Psalm. Also it fantasize is the word loving kindness, who is wise, let him give heed to these things, and consider the loving kindness the kindness is of the Lord. So from the first of this psalm to the end and inclusive to this psalm is going to stress God's loving kindness. Let the redeemed of the Lord say so, great verse in the Bible tells us that the Lord gathers from all the lands, the east, the West, the North and the South, his people. It may be the idea that the people of God had been scattered all over the world in captivity, and they're going to come back home. In the Old Testament, when you see the phrase, gathering God's people from the east and west, in North and South, you see it here you see it in Isaiah 43, verses five and six, it seems to refer to the Jewish people who had been scattered throughout.

Unknown Speaker  09:03
In the New Testament, it's expanded. Do you remember

Unknown Speaker  09:09
when a man came to

Unknown Speaker  09:10
Jesus? Is that Jesus? A servant is lying at home, near death. Please heal him. He says, I will come and heal him.

Unknown Speaker  09:24
He says, I'm a man under authority like you. I say to this one, do this, and he does it into this one go and he goes, I know that you can just say the word and my servant will be healed. And Jesus said, I have not found faith like this anywhere in Israel. And many will come from the east and west, north and south and recline it table with Abraham, Isaac and Jacob. That's Matthew eight, about verses five through 13. My point is when Jesus talks about people from the east, the west and north and south. He's including Gentiles. In that picture, here in Psalm 107, probably the focus is primarily on Jews. But God is going to gather his people from all countries, whatever nationality, whatever group, and he is going to call the home

Unknown Speaker  10:23
into one.

Unknown Speaker  10:26
Now, we're going to focus most of our attention on this next section of the psalm chapters, verses four through 32, verses four through 32. Now, this, each of these four sections, follows a similar structure. Each of them give a statement of a problem. And let's illustrate this as we go through the first time. From this first case, verses four and five. They wandered in a wilderness in a desert region, they did not find a way to inhabited city. They were hungry, and thirsty, and their soul

Unknown Speaker  11:19
faded within them.

Unknown Speaker  11:23
They were lost, confused, and at the end of their resources, hungry and thirsty, and their strength failed. Now, each of these four sections from verses four through 32, will stay a problem like this. Then, what it tells us is the people in the midst of their problem, they will cry out to the Lord, verse six, right here. They were, they cry, didn't they cry to the Lord in their trouble, and he delivered them out of their distresses. In each of these cases, the text will emphasize that in the midst of Israel's problems, they understand that there is no help except from God. There's no help but he'll look at verse 12, verse 12, talks about some who humbled their heart with labor, they stumbled, and there was none to help. The reason that I'm stressing that verse is because in the midst of these difficulties, they recognize that they have no resource but God, there was none to help. When other helpers fail, and comforts, flee, help of the helpless, oh abide with me. They recognize there's no other help. And then when they cry out to God, in the midst of their difficulty, God delivers the old from their problem. He delivers the home from their crisis. They were lost, they were confused, they were disoriented, they could not find their way to an inhabited city. They were hungry, they were thirsty, they cried to the Lord. And in verse seven, he answers their prayer. He led them also by a Straight Way to go to an inhabited city. God answers their cry, he answers their plea. And then in the next section, that's texts his let them give thanks to the Lord for His loving kindness and for his wonders to the sons of men. Verse one, for his loving kindness is everlasting. It's the same word used here in verse a. It's used in all I believe six times in Psalm 107. Let them give thanks. Listen, when we cry to the Lord in the midst of our distress, and pour out our grief to him and beg him for his help, and he answers

Unknown Speaker  14:13
don't forget to give him day. 10 lepers

Unknown Speaker  14:25
approached Jesus, they cried out, Jesus master, had mercy on us. Jesus said, Go and show yourself to the priests

Unknown Speaker  14:37
and be cleanse all the way. All 10 of them are cleansed. One of the things one of them returns

Unknown Speaker  14:49
to give God.

Unknown Speaker  14:52
Thanks. And Jesus says, Where are the nine? We're not 10 clans see Luke 1711 through 19? How many times have I been in among those nine? When I poured out my problem to God, and God answered, and I forgot to turn around and give Him thanks. Let them give thanks to the Lord, for his loving kindness, and for his wonders to the sons of man.

Unknown Speaker  15:32
And then in these sections, there's going to be a final section of praise or Thanksgiving or a final word of praise and thanksgiving in verse nine, he has satisfied the hungry, excuse me, he satisfied the thirsty soul, and the hungry soul he has filled with what is good. The Thanksgiving, the prays in verse nine relates to the crisis in verses four through nine, and relates to the answer that God has given to the crisis. Okay, so that structure is going to follow. And I think these parts, these episodes of life, these episodes of life are going to remind us that in all of life, God is the one to whom we turn for help and strength. And when he does give help and string, we give Him thanks, give verses 10 through 12, we find the same kind of format, and we will all through verse 32. But in verses 10 through 12, there's something a little different here. There were those who dwelt in darkness, and in the shadow of death, prisoners in misery, and chains, because they had rebelled against the word of the Lord and spurred the Council of the Most High, therefore he humbled their heart with labor, they stumbled, and there was none to help. Let me give you a chance here. If anyone wants to say, what do you think I may be thinking of, and you may be thinking of something I'm not taking. But what is the difference between this and the first account? In verses four through nine, what's the difference in this crisis as described in verses 10

Unknown Speaker  17:30
through 12? Any thoughts some of you probably have them but that's a

Unknown Speaker  17:48
self inflicted as Bill says. It is not stated in verses four through nine, that the person was really responsible in any way for his crisis for his trouble. But in verses 10 through 12, here, these people are prisoners, and in the darkness and shadow of death, in verse 11, because they had rebelled against the words of the Lord and spurn the Council of the Most High. There are times that I have found myself into problem in a problem,

Unknown Speaker  18:28
and I've not done anything wrong.

Unknown Speaker  18:31
I was trying to do the right thing, I was just in the wrong place, the wrong time, or or something else happened. But there are other times that I've gotten myself into problems because of my own foolishness. And I will tell you, sometimes, the Lord has been gracious to me, and delivered me from problems of my own making. And here as this person is in prison, in the shadow of death, and of course, this is the same word. It's one word shadow of death, used in Psalm 23 Verse For the walk through the valley of the shadow of death. It's the same word, but even though he is in prison, because of his own foolishness in chains and misery in the shadow of death and in darkness. In verse 13, he cried out to the Lord, he says, they cried out to the Lord in their trouble, and he saved the yield out of their distresses. He brought him out of the darkness in the shadow of death, and broke their bands apart. Let them give thanks to the Lord for His loving kindness and for his wonders to the sons of men, for he has shattered the gates of broads and cut the bars of iron asunder. We will come back to these. But here a person was imprisoned because of his own foolishness because of his own sin. He cried to the Lord in his distress realizing that there is none other who can help. And the Lord rescued Hillman delivered him and let film Give thanks to the Lord. The third problem, again a person than this problem, a person is sick. You've gotten used to this format right now, here is the various forms of crisis that we face in verse 17. Fools because of their rebellious ways, because of their iniquities were inflict afflicted. So as Bill said just a moment ago. They've gotten themselves into this problem by their own foolishness. It's self inflicted, because of their rebellious ways, because of their iniquities. These people are sick, not always is sickness, and there are sin and sickness connected in scripture. But we make a big mistake. If we say it's never connected in Scripture, it's not always connected. But it is connected sometimes. And here, this person, because of his iniquities, because of his rebellion, is near death in verse 18. There so abhorred all kinds of food, and they drew near to the gates of death, the gates of death is simply a poetic way to refer to death itself. It's used in Psalm nine verses 13 and 14, job 38, verse 17. If I ever mentioned a scripture and you don't get it down, you want to ask afterwards feel free to but the gates of death when Jesus said, The gates of Hades will not prevail against it, talking about the church. In Matthew 16, verse 18, dead these people, the church will overcome death, they will be victorious over death through Jesus resurrection. But here are people who are sick and on their deathbed because of their own sins because of their own wickedness because of their own problems. And again, in verse 19, they cried out to the Lord in their troubles, and he saved the old out of their distresses. He said his word and healed the old he delivered them from their destructions let the old Give thanks to the Lord for His loving kindness and for his wonders to the sons of man. Have you ever been in that situation

Unknown Speaker  23:02
where you had been on death's doorknob, and the Lord delivered you, let them give thanks to the Lord, for his loving kindness,

Unknown Speaker  23:16
in verse 22, let them all for a sacrifice of thanksgiving and tale of his works with joyful singing, find all the same elements. Now one more case of this

Unknown Speaker  23:30
traveling by sea.

Unknown Speaker  23:36
This is a longer Psalm, we can't do much of this. But I want you to look at verse 23, verses 23 through 27 is going to describe the crisis. But I want to make a brief point here, those who go down to the sea in ships, who do their business on great waters. Now the word that's translated business in the New American Standard Bible could be translated works. Not sure how it's translated in each of your versions, but business or works, but it's the same Hebrew word. It's used in verse 22. And use in verse 24. In verse 24, let them offer sacrifices of thanksgiving and tale of his works with joyful singing. That is speaking of God's works. That's the way the word is used in verse 24. They have seen the works of the Lord and His wonders in a deep verse 22 Verse 24, uses this word to speak of God's work but verse 23 uses it to speak of man's work man's business and man is going on shield in order to travel far away to conduct commerce to practice business to do he his work but God's work. God's wonders in verse 25. It says he spoke and raised up a stormy wind, which lifted up the waves of the sea, they rose to the heavens, they went down to the depths, their soul melted away in their misery. They reeled and staggered like drunken men, and we're at wit's

Unknown Speaker  25:29
end. When you look at the seas, the oceans, as you are flying across to Europe or around the world, you see how vast they are, to think about being out there in the midst of a violent storm. And knowing that death is certain. The statement it's made in Acts 27, about Paul and his companions traveling by shield, all hope, of our being say, was gradually abandoned. I can't imagine what that feeling was like to be at sea, to be helpless to do anything. And to know that death would be the end of the story.

Unknown Speaker  26:34
The word that is translated wit in verse 27, at least in the New American Standard Bible, is actually the Hebrew word for wisdom, which is used in verse 43 of this psalm, who is wise. And wisdom in the Old Testament often refers to a skill and ability to do something well. Do you remember those that worked on the tabernacle in Exodus 30, and Exodus 35. They are ones in whom the Spirit of the Lord had put wisdom or skill. This is what I'm trying to say, this is the point I'm trying to make here. They were at wit's end. The point is that they have done everything that human wisdom can.

Unknown Speaker  27:23
And there's no help it in verse 28, they cried to the Lord in their trouble. And he brought him out of their distresses.

Unknown Speaker  27:38
The first time I ever went overseas, was 30 years ago,

Unknown Speaker  27:44
I was traveling with three other preachers. I wasn't traveling with Christie and my son.

Unknown Speaker  27:52
But we were going to Moscow or Moscow or Moscow for a month to preach. And as we were getting closer to Russia, there was a violent storm

Unknown Speaker  28:09
arose.

Unknown Speaker  28:11
And at one point, there was a

Unknown Speaker  28:14
big streak of lightning.

Unknown Speaker  28:18
And one of the other preachers are with me terminals. Whoa, that was close. I didn't realize how close until a little while later, the pilot comes on. He says, Well, I guess you can tell that lightning had to play back there. I thought I couldn't tell that. And I thought, I didn't know we could stay up after lightning hit the plane. He says lightning hit the plane. He says, all the engines seem to work. And he says, he said, I think we're going to be fine. Now let me tell you, if you're a pilot, exude more confidence in that.

Unknown Speaker  29:05
But I want to tell you this. I know. I was crying out to the Lord in the midst of my distress.

Unknown Speaker  29:15
And I'm sure those other preachers were and I hope other people on board were

Unknown Speaker  29:22
and when we arrived, let them give thanks to the Lord. For his loving kindness is everlasting. His wonders to the sons of man

Unknown Speaker  29:39
in verse 32, let the old extol him in the congregation of people and praise him at the seat of elders. So here are the specific situations where he says we face this crisis we cried out to the Lord in the midst of our crisis. The Lord answered our prayer. We gave him thanks. And then a statement of praise for Thanksgiving. Any time you've experienced anything like that, it may not be you are in prison due to rebellion. It may not be you are on your deathbed due to your rebellion. But it may be that you've experienced some sickness because of your rebellion, or some penalty because of your rebellion. And God delivered you all of those are a reason for us to give thanks. Thanksgiving should be so

Unknown Speaker  30:37
easy for us in prayer. When we have been so abundantly blessed, we've all been so abundantly blessed. Thanksgiving should be so easy, as we just mentioned, the things that God has done, and beg him beg his help. In the midst of our difficulties, too.

Unknown Speaker  31:07
I want to make a quick point before we focus more on that. I want you to notice in verses 33, through 43, which we talked about earlier. And in those verses, we talked about how God changes lands in the positions of peoples, for example, God in verses 33 and 34, change his rivers to a wilderness and a fruitful land into a salt waste. Look at the reason for that in verse 34. because of the wickedness of those who dwell in it, God changes a fruitful land into a dry land, because of the wickedness of the people. But God also does the reverse. God in verse 35, changes a wilderness into a pool of water and a dry land into springs of water. I want you to read the verses 35 through 38 more closely when you get a chance. I want you to know that while God changes the fruitful land into a dry land because of our sins, there is no statement in the text, that God changes the dry land into a fruitful land because of the righteousness of the people.

Unknown Speaker  32:34
Every time God does that, it is a picture of his grace. Now, how are we to view those pictures?

Unknown Speaker  32:47
First of all, I think we're to view these pictures of Psalm 107 as specific

Unknown Speaker  32:55
circumstances

Unknown Speaker  32:58
in which God delivers his people. And like I said, at some level, I've experienced

Unknown Speaker  33:05
all of those. And you probably have as well.

Unknown Speaker  33:12
I also think, as we fit Psalm 107, into the big picture of the Bible, that all of these are also ways to speak of God delivering his people from captivity, from Babylonian captivity, in a sense, in Babylonian captivity, they were lost. They were hungry, and they were thirsty, and God guided them out. In Babylonian captivity, the people were imprisoned because of their own sin and their foolishness. But God and His Grace brought them out in Babylonian captivity, that people were sick and on their deathbed, but God brought them out. They were traveling, and they were hopelessly unable to deliver themselves from the horrible crisis that they faced from the horrible storm that they faced.

Unknown Speaker  34:14
And God delivered them out. I think that in a very real way. All of these are a pictures of God's deliverance of Babylonian captivity. But I think to in the bigger picture of Scripture, they're all pictures of what God has done for us in Jesus. They're all pictures of this.

Unknown Speaker  34:51
Now give some verses and I could give more but

Unknown Speaker  34:55
let's illustrate that People were lost, and hungry and thirsty. And they cried out to God in the midst of their crisis. And God answered their cry and said, Let them give thanks to the Lord.

Unknown Speaker  35:20
Jesus was at a well, he asked a woman give me a drink. She's surprised that he being a Jew

Unknown Speaker  35:32
has asked her for a Samaritan as her Samaritan woman for a drink.

Unknown Speaker  35:38
It begins a conversation. He said, if you would have known who is speaking to you,

Unknown Speaker  35:47
you would ask him, and he would give you living water?

Unknown Speaker  35:54
And she said, Sir,

Unknown Speaker  35:55
you have nothing to draw with and as well as deeper, how are you gonna get this water,

Unknown Speaker  36:01
but give me this water, that I don't have to come here and draw and train. As the conversation goes on. Jesus says, Go and call your husband and she says, I don't have a husband. And he's right.

Unknown Speaker  36:19
He said, You've been with five men. And the one was you're now you're with now's not your husband.

Unknown Speaker  36:29
Later when she asked her a question, and he answers, he says, well, the Messiah is coming. And he will give us all things. He or he will teach us all things. And he said, The one who is either one who

Unknown Speaker  36:43
speaks to you and he. The Bible says, she left her water pot and ran back to tell the people of the village, I have found a man who has told me all the things I've ever done, could he not be the cries? Now once you think about that, just a second. She's come here to draw water. But she's left leaving her water pot behind.

Unknown Speaker  37:15
She's already got a little taste

Unknown Speaker  37:19
of this water. That if you drink from, you'll never thirst again. Jesus satisfies the thirsty soul.

Unknown Speaker  37:34
When 5000 men had been listening to his teaching, not including women and children. The only resources available were five barley loaves and a couple of fish. Jesus says Have them sit down and he got you Thanks. And he broke the bread and He fed them all until they were satisfied and there was more leftover than they had when they started. And Jesus says, I am the bread of life. He who believes in me will never hunger.

Unknown Speaker  38:03
And he who comes to me will never thirst. Jesus is the answer to that song, to this song.

Unknown Speaker  38:19
People in prison do their own foolishness and Jesus brings them out. Have you ever thought about how many people in the book of Acts how many times people are released from prison in Acts in Acts five the apostles are thrown into prison and an angel of the Lord comes and unlocks the door and says go out, stay in in a temple his feet to them all the words of this life. The apostles are out there preaching the council gathers the next morning and they're waiting to try the apostles and they go to the jail to bring them for the trial and they're not there. And then someone comes running in is is those men who put into prison. They're out in the temple and they are speaking to the people all the words of this life. They were freed from prison in x 12, the night before his execution. The night before his execution. Peter is sleeping chained to two soldiers with two soldiers guarding the gate. Angel the Lord strikes him on the side the chains fall off of EEOB to prison gates open he walks out a free man

Unknown Speaker  39:26
I can tell you every one of us who is a follower of Jesus has been released from prison

Unknown Speaker  39:43
that don't know what your prison is that you got yourselves into by your own foolishness. But you've sinned and you were in prison to sin and the pictures of these people be released from prison in The Book of Acts is a picture of what Jesus does for all of us when we are freed from sin and saved from sin in Luke four, when Jesus was announcing his ministry at his hometown synagogue, look for verses 18 and 19. He said, The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he has anointed me to preach the gospel to the pooler, he has sent Me to proclaim release to the captives, and recovery of sight for the blind. I don't know, if your prison was sexual sin, I don't know if your prison was whatever sin it is. If you're a Christian,

Unknown Speaker  40:41
you've been released from prison.

Unknown Speaker  40:49
And another way to picture our condition is that we were sick as Isaiah one, firstly is one through six use that picture of a person that was so bruised from wound from head to toe that there is no healthy part on his skin, all of us were in this situation, and Christ has made us free. One illustration of this already alluded to Luke seven, one through 10. It's the parallel to Matthew eight, five through 13, that we mentioned earlier, but in John six, a centurion cash on 446 through 54, a centurion comes to Jesus and says, my, my son is laying at home and he is, is close to death. And Jesus said, Your son lives. He says that in John four. But what Jesus does for that boy in healing healed is a picture of what he does for each of us that we were dead in sin, and He gives us life listened to John 524 25. That's not represented on the PowerPoint, John 524, and 25. You want to write it down. Truly I say to you, that he who hears my word in believes him who has sent me has eternal life, and does not come into judgment, but past out of life, out of death into life. Truly, truly, I say to you, an hour is coming. And now is when the dad will hear the voice of the Son of God and those who hear will live. Jesus said in John five, Jesus said in John 453, your son lives, and now he is saying in John 525, that dad are hearing the voice of the Son of God and living. It's a picture of what God has done, and shipwreck in Paul's story in Acts 27, about being on that ship. Yes, God rescued them from the same kind of crisis that Psalm 107, verses 23, through 32 narrated it's the same kind of circumstance, God rescued them, God delivered them. Paul says, Last night there stood by me an angel of God whom I serve, said, do not fear, Paul, for I have given you all those who sail with you. But there's so many words connected to salvation, in Acts 27. In Acts 20, a,

Unknown Speaker  43:30
I think, the saving of Paul and his 276 companions on that shield is a picture of a greater salvation that God can give us. If we only turn to him in the midst of our crisis. He alone can handle he alone,

Unknown Speaker  43:59
can rescue us, and provide us with the bread of life and water of life. He alone can rescue us from the prison that we've got ourselves in. He alone can lift us up from our sick bed, and He

Unknown Speaker  44:14
alone can deliver us. from it. It is disastrous storm at sea. All of these, I think, in the big picture of Scripture, tell us that we must constantly give thanks for God who has brought us eternal salvation.

Unknown Speaker  44:40
It is hard for me and I imagine it is for you. To look up on people who have so many problems in life

Unknown Speaker  44:53
