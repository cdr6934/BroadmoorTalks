Unknown Speaker  00:09
I have tried this week, to be careful, I always try to be careful, I'm sure sometimes I slip up. When you're talking about one individual Psalm, it is Psalm, singular, and you're talking about more than one. It is Psalms. And so tonight are about several Psalms. And I asked you first to open your Bible to Psalm 45, Psalm 45. The Psalms that we're talking about tonight, are linked together, because they are characterized as royal Psalms, Royal Psalms. Now what I mean by Royal Psalms is they are psalms that focus on the human key. Some people define royal psalms in such a way as to include those psalms, which stress God as key. Those are royal psalms in some sense, but we're particularly talking about these that focus on the human key. And some of the things that distinguish these royal Psalms, some of the things that are characteristic of them, is they use words like King, they use the words like an anointed, which is the Hebrew term Messiah and the Greek term Christ, both been anointed, and are both It's the basic meaning of that word. So words like key words like anointed words, like David within the text. These are indications of some of the Royal Psalms, but royal Psalms, it's hard for us, I think, to see how they viewed a king. in First Samuel chapter eight, you remember when they came to Samuel, and they said, give us a king, to judge us like the nations and to fight our battles, they put such hope and such dreams into this one person, a key. Ultimately, a lot of people are going to be disappointed when you choose a king, because they never quite live up to expectations. There's a passage in Oh, excuse me, some of the passages in the Old Testament that give that are very important in our discussion that we may not invoke tonight as God's promises to David in Second Samuel seven, in Psalm 132, which we're not going to touch up on. It stresses those promises to David that God's swore that he would raise up one from David's house to sit on his throne after David's time, all the kings of Judah are descendants of David.

Unknown Speaker  03:26
Now a passage which shows the great hope that some put in their key, there's a passage in lamentation is full four, verse 20. And that passage in lamentation for verse 20, talks about the key as being the breath of our nostrils, The Lord's anointed, and I just liked that expression for the standpoint that shows the great hope that they put in this person, that they had great ideals for what a king should be. And maybe no passage better sums up those ideals for a king. Then Psalm 45. Psalm 45, is not addressed to God. It is addressed to the king. You notice in verse one, my heart overflows with a good theme. I address my verses to the king. My tongue is the pin of a ready rider. And it seems that Psalm 45 was composed for a wedding of a king to celebrate his wedding. And the text describes the king. It says in verse two, you are fairer than the sons of men. Grace is poor. upon your lips, because God has blessed you forever, you are fairer than the sons of men. The King is emphasized the looks of the key. In order to be a king, you needed to look the part. It is interesting in the Bible, how rarely the looks of the people are alluded to, it just doesn't happen very much. If the looks of the character are alluded to, somehow it's going to play a part in the story. Whether it be Rachael being good looking, or egg lon being very heavy. It's going to play some part in the story. But we were first introduced to Saul in First Samuel nine in verse two, we were told that there is no better looking man in all the land of Israel. David is also in first key in First Samuel 16 Verse 12, described as a good looking man. Now another passage I have up here is Second Samuel 14, in verse 25. That's talking about Absalom, there was no one so prized in all the land of Israel for his looks, as Absalom, Absalom does it become king, in the sense that all the people follow him, but his bid for the throne is helped because he looks the part. And also in First Kings one we see the same thing about adding Nyjah at a Nyjah is described as a good looking man. Now, I this was a few years before I was born, you me you might think you might think this doesn't make any difference to us today. Some of somebody here may remember this, but it's before my time. People who heard the Nixon Kennedy debate on radio said next one. People who saw it on television, say Kennedy one. Does that still make a difference? In how people perceive a leader, it still makes a difference. And here the king is said to be fairer than the sons of men. And not only is he the best looking if man, he is the mightiest and strongest of men. In verse three, Gird your sword on your thigh Obeidi one, in your splendor and in Your Majesty. And in Your Majesty, verse four says, ride on victoriously in verse five, your arrows are sharp, the people fall under you, your arrows are in the heart of the king's entity. The King is a powerful warrior who conquers all his foes. So it is describing the king is the best looking at man, as a powerful warrior who conquers all his foes whose arrows always strike at the heart of his enemies. And also he is a man of great character in verses six and seven, your throne of God is forever and ever. A sceptre of uprightness is the scepter of Your kingdom. You have loved righteousness, and hated wickedness. Therefore, God, Your God has anointed you with the oil of gladness above Your fellows. Your God, you've loved righteousness, you've hated iniquity. Verse four says, verse four, in in Your Majesty, right own victoriously for the coals of truth, and meekness, and righteousness. Let your right hand teach you all some things. truth, righteousness. These were the reasons that he fought. Now I am old enough to remember the reruns of the Superman television show and Superman fault for truth, justice, and the American way. And this is an ancient Israelite equivalent Just as those TV shows we're trying to portray him as the most noble a person who fought most noble of people who fought for noble reasons. This text portrays the key as one whose battles are not fought simply because of a desire for power or conquest, but because he is fighting for truth,

Unknown Speaker  10:23
and meekness. Now, let me ask you a question. How many men embody all those qualities, that they are the best loci, that they are the strongest, they are people of principle, who are the most noble of man. I have found out this week I have a fellow Dickson county graduate here. But in the class ahead of me, there were 400 I believe in my graduating class, the class before me. The person who had the highest grade point average was also the best athlete. How many times has that happened? But he had the highest grade point average. He was the best athlete. And I do not consider myself a good judge of the next category. But listening to conversations, he was viewed as the best looking. And he was also a biblical Christian. How many times do you see that? Because I grew up with that. Because I grew up with that. I don't think I realized

Unknown Speaker  12:08
how unique it was. It may be its pride that leads me to say that it's but

Unknown Speaker  12:22
all my sons were that in their high school. Of course, they were homeschooled and didn't have much competition.

Unknown Speaker  12:32
But you don't see someone who fulfills all these hopes. And all these dreams of being powerful and mighty and being all the demands should be and yet those are their ideals for a king. Those are their ideals of what a king should be. Let's look at another song. Let's look at Psalm two, Psalm two. Now we're gonna say a little bit before we get to verse seven. But let's begin in verse one. Why are the nations in an uproar, and the peoples devising a vain thing? The kings of the earth take their stand, the rulers take counsel together against the Lord and against his anointed, saying, Let us tear their fetters apart and cast their cords from us. The world believes that subjection to God is slavery, and they can't wait to break off his fetters and to tear off his chains. But if you want to know what real slavery is, disregard God, live in rebellion to God. And you will find out what real slavery is. But he takes people a lot to realize that in verse four, he who sits in the heavens laughs The Lord scoffs at them. These nations in their rebellion are no competition to the God of heaven. He who sits in the heavens laughs The Lord SCAF says he'll in verse five, He will speak to the old in his anger and terrify the old in his fury, saying, but as for me, I've installed My King up on Zion, my holy mountain. Now, let's look at verse seven. Particularly we're going to stress verses seven through nine, I will surely tell of the decree of the Lord. He said to me, You are my son, today I have begotten you. In God's promises to David in Second Samuel says Have one and verse 14, God said, I will be a father to his home, and he will be a son to me. Second Samuel 714 In Psalm 89, verses 26 and 27, he will cry to me, You are my God, my God and the rock of my salvation, I shall make you my firstborn, the highest of the kings of the earth. The king cries to God, you are my father, God describes the king as my firstborn. The relationship that is described between the Father and the Son is a follow up between the king, God and the king is a father son relationship. I will be a father to him, he will be assigned to me, God says, You are my son, today I have begotten you. Back in Psalm two in verses eight and nine, ask of me and I will surely give the nations as Your inheritance and the very ends of the earth as your possessions you shall break the old with a rod of iron, and you shall shatter the old like earthenware. I will give you the nation's acid inheritance, the ends of the earth, as you were possessions, the king from the line of David, the King, who is in a special relationship with God is promised universal dominion. Now, I want to ask you a question. You can feel free to enter this.

Unknown Speaker  16:53
But I want to tell you

Unknown Speaker  16:53
before I let you answer it, it may be a trap. Okay. When did the kings of Israel exercise the world wide Dominion described in Psalm two verses eight and nine? When did they exercise that kind of worldwide dominion? What would you say? Resurrection. Okay, don't don't don't preach my point before I get there. Okay. Are you talking in Old Testament history? When would that if the end? If you sang and some of your thinking I'm sure. They never did. They never did. In the days of David and Solomon, if I get a response to that, people will say, Well, David Solomon, it's time. They were about as powerful as they ever were going to be in those times. There's one time in the divided kingdom period where they exercised almost the same kind of control over the land. But but in the times of David and Solomon, they come as close to this. But Israel was not the superpower in the ancient world, at any point in their history. kings of Assyria and Babylon, who would have come later and read the words of Psalm two would have laughed at this statement at the kings of Israel, that the kings of Judah that these kings would exercise world wide dominion. Now, I want you to keep keep this in mind. Let me try to pair let me try to say this in the best way I can. I love the Old Testament, absolutely love the Old Testament. Right book is a great book. And I do believe sometimes in the past, some places still, there's not been enough attention paid to the Old Testament. But I am so thankful that the biblical story doesn't end at the end of the Old Testament. Because if it did, you would have a book of unfulfilled promises. If that's where it stopped, you see the promises and you see the lofty goals and ideals but we're still fulfillment.

Unknown Speaker  19:56
Keep this in mind. Now, as we go to Psalms 72 Psalm 72, will also speak of the universal dominion of the key. Psalm 72 is one of two psalms that is attributed to Solomon in the heading or set as for Solomon are of Solomon, a Psalm of Solomon, and other is 127. And in Psalm 72, in verses eight through 11, that same kind of promise of universal dominion, made in Psalm two also appears in Psalm 72. In verse eight may he rule from sea to sea, from River to the ends of the earth, let the nomads of the desert bow before Him and His enemies lick the dust. Let the kings of Tarshish and of the islands bring presents, the kings of Sheba and Seba offer gifts, and let all kings bow down before Him, and all nations serve Him. So again, you have this promise that this king from the line of David is going to exercise such dominion, that he will rule from sea to sea, from rivers to the ends of the earth, and kings from faraway places will come and bow down before Him and offer gifts to Him. And they will all serve Him, this promise of universal dominion of the king. But Psalm 72, also stresses even more strongly stresses the character of this king, that this king will be characterized by righteousness, and justice. Look at the first four verses, give the king your judgment of God and your righteousness to the king's sons. May he judge the people with righteousness and you're afflicted with justice. Let the mountains bring peace to the peoples and the heels in righteousness. May he vindicate the afflicted of the people save the children of the needy, and crush the oppressors. The King is pictured as one who vindicates the weak, and who crushes the ones who are oppressors in the words of Romans 13. He punishes evil and praises those who do who do well. This is what the king is to be. He exercised his righteousness and justice it said of David, in Second Samuel eight and verse 15, through 18, that he did righteousness and justice. It is said of Solomon in First Kings 10 And verse nine that he did righteousness and justice. And here this is an ideal for the king. Look at verse 12. In verse 12, he will deliver the needy when he cries for help the afflicted also and he'll who has no helper, he will have compassion on the poor and the needy and the lives of the needy, he will say, he will rescue their life from oppression and violence, and their blood will be precious in his sight. The king cares for all of the people included in those he cares for in verse 12, the needy and the afflicted in verse 13, the poor and the needy, and the needy. All of these are precious to him. The kings of Assyria were cruel and brutal. They killed their opponents in horrific ways, and often recorded those on monuments to be remembered for ages to come. They rejoice in their cruelty. While God says, These kings will rejoice

Unknown Speaker  24:25
in their compassion

Unknown Speaker  24:29
and compassion, for the weakest for the poor, for the needy, and for the afflicted. Now I asked you a moment ago how many kings of Israel exercise the kind of worldwide dominion? It's Psalm two, it's Psalm 72, verses eight through 11 Speak up and we saw none of them do it. How many of Kings how many of the kings of Israel and Judah did righteousness

Unknown Speaker  25:10
and justice? You had one kingdom

Unknown Speaker  25:17
saw in the days of Sol, David and Solomon. Then when Rehoboam was king of Judah, the kingdom divided Jeroboam is king of Israel. Rehoboam is king in Judah. How many kings of Israel from Jeroboam on? How many of those kings? Were good? I know you know that. None? None, not one of them. Now, one of them was good when you get to the land of Judah, the descendants of David who had the temple in Jerusalem present with them. How many of them were good? We have a few. Joe Asa was pretty good. Jehoshaphat was pretty good. You have some kings right there in the middle, with Joe as who are described as being good, but did as much bad as they did good. Did it the end of their history, you find two good kings, you find Hezekiah and Josiah, but steel, kings who did righteousness and justice were the exception rather than the rule. And you had saw, like Ahaz and Manasa, who were so wicked, that they offer their own children is sacrifices, things that the pagan nations do that God dispossessed before he Israel? Let me ask you a question. Is the history of these kings and I'm particularly thinking of what's recorded in the books of Samuel Kings and Chronicles is the history of those key things, recorded in Samuel Kings and Chronicles, what you would expect from reading the royal Psalms. Do you see kings that are characterized by righteousness, and justice, and kings that are exercising dominion over all kinds of people? Is that what we see? What we see is we go from the book of Judges where the people did what was right in their own eyes, we go to Seoul, where we have a king who does what's right, in his own eyes. The king often led the people into apostasy, as much as he directed their hearts to God, even though God told the king that you write out for yourselves a copy of the law and read it all the days of your life. In Deuteronomy 17. God told them that but they didn't live up to that. And you have even a good king like Josiah who is seeking to make temple reforms and the priest find the book of the law and the house of God in Second Kings 22. And they bring it to Josiah and Josiah apparently hasn't heard it before. And when he hears the words of the law, he tears his clothes and he weeps. Know, their history is not what we would expect. Look at Psalm 89, if you would, we're just going to get to say a little bit about this particular psalm. All of these songs are worthy of much more attention than we can give them. I do have cards with me, that I'll be glad to give you if you would want to take them for a podcast that I do. Right now I've just finished through Psalm 53. But Lord willing, when I finish this, we're going to have a podcast on every single Psalm. And steel, it's only about 2025 minutes is very brief. But if you want to study the Psalms, I hope it can be a help to you but these psalms are all worthy of so much more attention than we can give them.

Unknown Speaker  29:58
But in Psalm a 89 the words loving kindness and faithfulness are key words in the Psalm both of those songs, both those words are used, I believe seven times you notice their use right in the first verse, I will sing of the loving kindness of the Lord forever. To all generations, I will make known your faithfulness with my mouth. This Psalm is going to celebrate God's loving kindness and God's faithfulness, God's loving kindness, God's faithfulness to David in his promises to David. Now, remember last night we use Psalm 13 As an illustration earlier in the week we use Psalm 69 As an illustration, and we said usually the Psalms move from lament to praise. Usually they're pouring out their grief to God. And yet, those individual psalms of lament will end on a note of praise. Psalm 89 is different from that it does not move from lament to praise as is typical in the Psalms, but it moves from praise to lament. The first 18 verses are praise to God, magnifying God for His greatness and His glory. But then verses 19 through 37 of Psalm 89. They focus on The King from the line of David. This section of Psalm 89 is basically a poetic retelling of Second Samuel seventh. It is emphasizing God's promises to David, and how God promised his loving kindness and his faithfulness to David, looking at verse 33, as an example of what I'm stressing, but I will not break off by loving kindness from him, nor deal falsely in my faithfulness, my covenant I will not violate nor will I alter the utterance of my lips. Once I have sworn by my holy this, I will not lie to David his descendants shall endure forever, and his throne as the sun before me is shall be established forever like the moon, and the witness in the sky is faithful Silla. But after that, poetic recounting of the promises today that the brutal reality of Israel's history is described. Listen to these words. You have cast off and rejected. You have been full of wrath against your anointed, he whispered in the covenant of Your servant, you profane the crappiest crown in the dust. You have broken down all his walls you have brought his strongholds to ruin all who pass along the way plunder him, he has become a reproach to his neighbors, you have exalted the right hand of his adversaries, you have made all his enemies rejoice, you also turn back the edge of the sword and if not made him stand in battle in verse 45. You have shortened the days of his youth who have covered heel we shame. Now, let me review for you real quickly. What happened to the last few kings of Judah after Josiah is killed, the people of the land put his son Jehovah has on the throne. He is King for a grand total of three months before Pharaoh Nico comes, removes him from the throne takes him as a slave to Egypt, where he is the rest of his life. He sits on the throne Jehovah Kim Jehovah Killam is called in conflict against Babylon and the Babylonians are laying seeds the city apparently when he dies, after he dies, the part that people put on the throne, Jehovah Chen, who again rains only three months before he surrenders to Babylon, and goes into captivity and spends the rest of his life there. Zedekiah is the next king of Judah Zedekiah is told by Jeremiah surrender to Babylon. Don't be rebellious surrender to the own, your life will be spared. Zedekiah doesn't listen. Said a chi is captured. He is brought before Nebuchadnezzar The last thing that Zedekiah ever sees, are his son's killed before his eyes, as he helplessly watches on.

Unknown Speaker  35:12
And then his eyes are put out. And that is the last key from the line of David, to rule in the Old Testament, the last king. And I want you to notice what Psalm 89 Verse 49 ask, where are your former loving kindness is a lord, which you swore to David in your faithfulness, those two key words loving kindness, and faithfulness, think God promised to David. Now they become a complaint instead of a statement of praise God, what happened in your promises?

Unknown Speaker  36:16
Did God prop? Did God's promises fail? To God? Was God not able to keep his word and make the kings from the line of David, all that he said they would be. When it seems I God's promises it failed. I think these psalms teach us just hang on, and wait. Because if it seems like God's promises, it failed. There is a fulfillment coming that is beyond any expectation. Now these psalms find their ultimate fulfillment in Jesus. How do I know that? Because the New Testament continually quotes them and applies the old to Jesus, your throne, oh god is forever and ever a scepter of righteousness is a scepter of Your kingdom. You have love righteousness in hated wickedness. Psalm 45, verses six and seven is quoted in Hebrews one in verses eight and nine, as Peter in the brethren are praying and acts for they pray, why does the heathen rage and a people imagine a vain thing the kings of the earth have taken their stand and the rulers have gathered together against the Lord and against his anointed and applies these words to what happened to Jesus. You are my son, today I have begotten you. Those are the words of Psalm two, seven. They are applied to Jesus. They're applied to Jesus at His baptism. You are my son today I have begotten you. They're applied to Jesus at His transfiguration. And his brother tant stated, in Acts 13, verse 33, they are applied to Jesus and His resurrection. God has fulfilled the promise to our children, and he's raised up Jesus, as it is written in the second Psalm, You are my son, today I have begotten you. The point is, all their hopes and all their dreams, for these kings were fulfilled. In Jesus, Psalm two verses eight and nine, ask of me, and that will give the nations as Your inheritance and the ends of the earth as your possession. Those words are used in the letter to the church it at Theia Tyron, Revelation two verses 26 and 27. And in in Revelation 12, verse five, there was a man child who was born who was destined to rule all nations in whose hand was a rod of iron.

Unknown Speaker  39:30
clear allusion, to Psalm to the point that I'm trying to stress those songs, find their ultimate fulfillment. It healed now when I say that in first of all, Curtis asked me the other night if I'd say something about that word, fulfillment.

Unknown Speaker  40:03
That word fulfillment can be used in a very plain way in new test, for example, in Matthew 13, verse 48, they catch fish and the net is filled, fulfilled can have the idea of field fall. Sounds like a dictionary definition, doesn't it? It's not very helpful maybe. But Jesus completes, Jesus fulfills these psalms. That is not always to say that these psalms spoke exclusively of Jesus, I think sometimes we get that idea for something to be a prophecy of Christ, it must speak of Christ and Christ alone. Now, I think there are passages like that. I think there are passages like that the Lord said to my Lord, Sit at my right hand to make your enemies a footstool for your feet. So I'm one two in verse one, there are direct prophecies of Christ. You Bethlehem of effort that you will give birth. To him, who will be a ruler of nations a paraphrase of Micah five and verse two, there are passages like that. But also Jesus fulfills the types and the shadows of the Old Testament. For example, Jesus feels Passover, and the Passover lamb and all that is associated with that. First Peter Five, Verse seven, or excuse me, First Corinthians five, verse seven, Christ, our Passover was sacrificed for us. All these things, the Sabbath day, the feast days, the sabbatical year and the Jubilee year, all these things are prophecies of Christ, not in the sense that they spoke exclusively of he'll, they were lessons and instructions to Israel as to how to live and how to behave, but they had a greater and deeper and richer fulfillment in him. Now, when I say to that he fulfilled these. I'm not saying in every case, there is a point for point, correspondence and let me illustrate. It was said of the king. In Psalm 45, and verse two, you are fairer than the sons of man. Did that apply? To our King Jesus. He has no stately form, or badges state that we should look upon him, nor appearance, that we would be attracted to him. It's not saying in every point there's an exact correspondence to Christ. But it is saying that Christ fulfilled Psalm 45, in that all that God intended for man to be is fulfilled in Jesus and moreso. And more, so. He is also God coming to flesh. But all these passages, created a warning for a king for a ruler, who would fulfill all these expectations, expectations that were never met. And yet, the promises were still cherished, as they long for this one to come. Now, what you have in some of these passages I'm putting on the board and I'm only mentioning a few are a few New Testament passages which stress Jesus is King. In Matthew three, Matthew two, in verses three through five, they come to Bethlehem, or they come to Jerusalem, the wise man and they ask, where is he who is born king of the Jews, the term King of the Jews is not used again in that book till we get to the trial of Jesus. Let me encourage you to do something. Take a concordance and look up the term king in the New Testament times that used of Jesus And you know what I think you'll find? least half I think a little over half of the reference is to Jesus as King, surround the crawls. For example, what John 19, verses 19, through 27, John 19, verses 19, through 22. As Pilate has above the head of Jesus written in three languages, Jesus of Nazareth, the King of the Jews, all who go there can read it and see it. Some come to Pilate and say, don't say he's the king of the Jews. But say, he said that he's the king of the Jews. Pilate says, what I have written, I have written is all who came by that day, see above his head, Jesus of Nazareth, the King of the Jews. Jesus does, right. And in a sense, the cross is his throne. From which he supplies, his mercy, his grace, his compassion, even as he was die. One of the things he said, Are you not the Christ, Save yourself and us? And the other thing he said, Do you not fear God? Since we are under the same sentence of condemnation, and we indeed justly, for we are getting what we deserve for our deeds, but this man has done anything wrong. He turns to Jesus, and says, Remember me, when you come into your kingdom. And Jesus says, Today, you will be with Me in Paradise. And we could talk more about what we're told the New Testament to do for salvation if you have questions about it, and if that account arises it, but in Jesus the King, he is all God intended me, man to be, the king was a son of God in a special relationship with God, Jesus, that is true in a whole different realm, in a much greater and much higher realm than it was of the king from the line of David. And he says, All authority is given to Me in heaven and earth. Go therefore, and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, Son, the Holy Spirit and teaching them to observe all things that I commanded you follow on with you always to the end of the world. He is ruler over all nations, and he exercises justice and righteousness, He is King right now, right now. But his kingdom is not all it will be. For when he comes. Every knee will bow and every tongue will confess that Jesus is Lord to the glory of God. And the last enemy death will be defeated. And we will chant Oh, Death, where is your staying? Oh grave, where is your victory? Thank God for the victory in Jesus Christ.

Unknown Speaker  48:40
Our Lord, let us pray.

Unknown Speaker  48:47
Oh Lord, our God. We thank you that you are a promise keeping God a God faithful to your word. A God who does what you say. Thank you. May we love you. May we hold to your promises may we cling to them in the midst of a confused world,

Unknown Speaker  49:14
that we cling to the hope that we have in you. We pray to God that you hold on to us, strengthen us when days are dark. When promises when we begin in our weakness to doubt if your promises will be fulfilled. Help us to remember who you are. What you have done.

Unknown Speaker  49:51
A what you will do. We pray God, you bring us home to yourself in heaven forever. In Jesus name, amen. Thank you all for your attention all week. Tomorrow night what I plan to talk about are the impractical story Psalms. Those are psalms that call down curses upon others break their teeth. Oh god. Are those things that we should ever say today in prayer? And how in the world could we ever speak of Jesus being a fulfillment of those psalms? Lord willing, we'll try to do that. Tomorrow in Psalm 37, a wisdom Psalm, Lord willing on Friday night. Thank you
