It is always a privilege for us to come and assemble in God's presence, to remember who he is to give him the praise that is rightly due Him to be stimulated to greater faith and trust and service in his kingdom. So worship is the worship of God is the most meaningful activity that you and I could engage in appreciate those songs that they've led for us this morning that calls to be holy, because God is holy, and to be strong and courageous. And so we appreciate all of our Bible class teachers, starting a new class appreciate Jeremy's efforts as we get into the Old Testament. And so we want to continually fill our hearts and minds with God's Word as we seek to become more like Him. We all have our weaknesses in our lives. I certainly do. We all do. But God gives us strength and grace to overcome this, the trials that we face, as we seek to please Him in our lives. You know, in the scriptures, as we even saw this morning, in our class, God sets individuals before us like Moses and others, who are examples of faith and love and obedience. Now God shows us while God shows us their weaknesses and their failures, he also shows us their faith in their courage, and their faithfulness. And Moses is a case in point man who was God's spokesman. He had his flaws just like I do. But he was a man of tremendous courage and faith and leadership. Abraham is another one. Another one I think about, just going to talk about briefly this morning with Noah, you think about the story of Noah. And his day back in the Old Testament, the world was corrupt, full of sand, God was fed up with the sin of the world. And he determined to destroy his creation of very people, the very world that he he made he that's determined to destroy that world. He told Noah, that to build an ark, which was about 450 feet long, 75 feet wide and 50 feet high, and together to have every animal into that ark, in war, Noah that and for 40 days coming, it was going to rain, night and day, 40 days and 40 nights, and we a flood that would destroy the Earth. It's interesting at that time in history, that rain had never fallen, that a mist arose from the ground to water the land, but they had never seen any rain. And God said to Noah, that he's gonna send 40 days of rain as can flood the earth. And it's just interesting to note that Noah, the Bible indicates that Noah took God at His Word and obeyed him completely. There's a text in Hebrews chapter 11, that suggested Noah was moved by a deep reverence, and a holy fear of God. And so I want to title my lesson this morning. Simply this, this, this concept. And it's a quality that we've got to develop in the lives of the quality of holy fear. And I want to us to think about this in Noah's life, but then make application to our own lives, and really to suggest to each of us that this all important quality of holy fear, must be at the center of our hearts and our minds if we're going to be found faithful and pleasing in God's sight. And if we're going to avoid sin and overcome sin, this is the quality that will anchor our souls against the assault of Satan, holy, fear, reverence, fear, whatever way you want to look at that, identify that. And so by developing the sense of holy fear, then we can be better husbands and fathers wives and mothers, sons and daughters, preachers, Baba class teachers, elders, SONG LEADERS, whatever the case might be, it'll help us to be stronger Christians. So let's begin for just a moment by looking at this text in Hebrews chapter 11, which is going to be on the screen. And then I want to make some applications to

Mike Roy  04:11
this principle. So again, we're just focusing, zeroing in on an attitude of heart that Noah had, and he had manifested in really didn't see that anywhere else in the world that he was a part of. So the text here, in Hebrews chapter 11, suggests that Noah was a man who demonstrated an illustrated what reverence is what holy fear is all about. So Hebrews chapter 711, and verse seven. The ESV says this By faith Noah, being warned by God concerning events as yet unseen and reverent fear, constructed an ark for the saving of his household. By this he condemned the world became an air of the righteousness that comes by faith. So I want to suggest To you, to each of us this morning. It was this quality and Noah's heart of holy fear that empowered him and enabled him to build this monstrous Ark and view of an impending flood to him never even seen rain before. It was this quality that made him do that. Whenever and when he started to do that, and build this ark, it took about 120 years and I can still hear the hecklers drive another nail for me, no rains coming, we never seen rain. But no one was compelled and propelled by the sense of holy fear. He believed God, he believed God's word. He believed God's warning, he believed God's promises. And so it was Reverend fear that caused Noah to obey God to do this incredible thing. The New King James Version says that he was moved with godly fear. And then the NIV puts it this way said by faith when no one warned of things not yet seen in holy fear. So that's kind of some ways where I get the title of my lesson, so no one was moved by holy fear. And so I want to suggest to each bus this morning, I've got four points

Mike Roy  06:15
that I want to make by way of application. But I want to suggest to us in very basic terms, if we want to have the praise of God, the acceptance of God, we've got to live our lives with this at the center of our hearts, we've got to have a level of holy fear that's going to respond in faith to what God has promised. And so that that means anybody who was going to become a child of God, a New Testament, Christian is going to respond to what Jesus said, in terms of faith and repentance and confession and baptism, because that's what God commanded. The only response to that is, Yes, Lord, I will do that. And when we say things like, it doesn't really matter what God says, and we have our own views and opinions that we don't, we're not manifesting this type of in displaying this type of attitude that Noah did so clearly. So there's four points I want us to notice this morning about holy fear or deep reverence. The first point is to simply say that we are commanded to be holy and to fear God. And so when God commands us to do something, first of all, it's something that we can do is something that we must do. And so when we look at Scripture and find that God commands us to be holy, when He commands us to fear him, is because these are the most important things in a human human experience that a person's life, if we're going to seek to be pleasing to Him. So notice this passage in First Peter chapter one. And verses 14 through 16. Peter says, As obedient children, do not be conformed to the passions of your former ignorance, but as he who called you is holy, you also be holy. So the first reason for us being holy, is because God is holy. It's the greatest challenge, I think one of the greatest challenges for each of us is to keep holiness at the heart of our lives, and to let that be the mindset of our lives. So as he who called you is holy, you also be holy in all your conduct, in all your behavior, since it is written, You shall be holy, for I am holy. We want to spend eternity in heaven praising God, for forevermore, he is a holy God, and we got to be holy people. don't accomplish that on our own basis. But we we receive that and we achieve that through our obedience to the gospel of Christ, I want you to see in Scripture, God commands us to be holy. That means we've got to turn our minds and eyes and lives away from all this corrupt and sinful in the world all around us. And again, the motivation in Scripture is that we need to be holy because God is holy. In the same context, I'm gonna put up the next verse. So in verse 17, Peter goes on to say this and if you call on him as father, who judges impartially according to each one's deeds, conduct yourselves with fear. conduct yourselves with fear throughout the time of your exile. Do you realize brethren, we are in exile. We are living an exiled life. We're Swiss strangers and sojourners. And that's why we sing this song, as it relates to God's word that we are to regard it with reverence, and perform it with all when we come to the Word of God, that is the the final authority. And so again, in this Texas instance, seem to notice that both of his concepts have seen in verse 16. He says, You shall be holy, if he says, conduct yourselves with fear. So this idea of holy fear is communicated throughout the scriptures. And we need to recognize that the first point I want you to understand is that God commands holiness, any commands that we fear Him is for our benefit as for our goods. Secondly, I think we need to see the urgency and the priority of living by these commands, we can get so caught up in the world around us and lose sight of God's teaching. But in Scripture, the idea of being holy and fearing God is something that should be the highest priority of our lives that we're going to be guided by His Word. And we're going to seek to please Him on that basis. Look at this Old Testament passage in Joshua Chapter 24. There's so much that we can learn from the Old Testament we're learning that again, this this quarter in Jeremy's class, but so much of what God is trying to teach us, is shown in the Old Testament. So this is Joshua's farewell address. He's the one leading the people had lit led the people into the Promised Land, there's so much disobedience, so much unbelief, and all the wandering that took place there, but his life is about over. And so what does he say in his farewell address to the people of Israel, he said, Now fear the Lord, and serve Him with all faithfulness. Look, Listen to the NIV for maybe emphasis, throw away the gods of your ancestors, throw away the gods, your ancestors worship beyond the freydis River, and in Egypt, and serve the Lord. But if serving the Lord seems undesirable to you, then choose for yourselves this day whom you will serve, whether the gods your ancestors served beyond the Euphrates, for the gods of the Amorites, and whose land you are living. But as for me, in my my household, we will serve the Lord. So in Joshua's farewell address, when we give farewell addresses, we know that our life is coming to an end, we talk to our children, our spouses, or grandchildren, children, whoever it might be, we say what's of the highest importance. And so Joshua was telling the people, if you're going to be acceptable to God, and want His blessings to rest on you, you need to fear God, and serve Him with all of your strength. And again, it's a reminder, I think, for each of us, that fearing God is a choice, and it is a daily choice. We either choose to fear people, or we choose to fear God fearing God is that choice. We see in the Old Testament, as well as so many verses that we could look at, again, that indicate the high priority that fearing God and reverencing. His word needs to be in our lives. And in Proverbs chapter one, verse seven, this what Solomon says, the fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge. fools despise wisdom and instruction, this type of phrase is used repeatedly in Proverbs and maybe some other passages in scripture. But I want you to think about this in Proverbs chapter one, really, in Proverbs, chapters, one through nine, constitutes Solomon's advice to his sons.

Mike Roy  13:14
As you look through all these verses here, as we can contemplate that, so chapters one through nine, record Solomon's instructions to his son, so what do we tell our children? Number one, the fear of God is the beginning of wisdom, you want to be smart, want to be successful? You want to be wise, Fear God first. That's what he's telling us. As most of you know, through the years, one of my role models and mentors was Harold comer. I worked with him at the college, the church in Florence 36 years ago, hoping I'll look there, 36 years older, myself, I do. Anyway, I worked with him and he had VBS, and some lessons that he preached from this, this section of Proverbs. He said, he titled it what God and the wisest man in the world would say to young people. Think about that what God would say, and the wisest man in the world would say to young people, what is it, Fear God, reverence Him, turn away from sin, that type of thing. So secondly, as we think about this concept of holy fear, we need that we need to feel that urgency and the priority of these commands in Scripture. The third point that I want to focus on this morning as we continue to talk about this concept that was so characteristic, Noah, is that we need to see the benefit sometimes we have a hard time fearing God, or maybe living holy lives, because we think that some ways that sin is fulfilling and it's gratifying and I can live in unrestrained type of life and we don't really see the benefits but when we focus on the benefits, it helps us to practice these these commands In our lives. And so notice, in Exodus chapter 20, again, it's interesting this morning, I'm going through some of the Old Testament examples that illustrate this principle. So this is after the giving of the 10 commandments. In Exodus chapter 20, says, When the people saw the thunder, and the lightning and heard the trumpet and saw the mountain and smoke, they trembled with fear. They stayed at a distance and said to Moses, speak to us yourself, and we will listen. But do not have God speak to us, or we will die. They were terrified. It's interesting in this context, that there was a earthly fear, a terror that the head of God said, most of us speak to us, don't let God speak to us. And so look at verse 20. It is this illustrates one of the benefit, the main benefit, perhaps primary benefit of fearing God, Moses said to the people, ironically, do not be afraid. Do not be afraid, God has come to test you. So that the fear of God will be with you to keep you from sinning, when I give it to Sanders, because I don't fear God, when you give it the same as because you do not fear God sufficiently, fearing God will keep us from sin. In the language here, the NIV is so the

Mike Roy  16:19
so that the fear of God will be with you. The New American Standard Version says that the fear of God may remain with you. And so the fear of God will keep us from sin. That's one of the benefits that that we acquire by practicing a healthy and a wholesome fear of God. So Exodus chapter 20, was a remarkable experience for the people as they come to Sinai, if we talked about this morning in our class, that given the law, and and all the commandments over there, and and God demonstrated His power at this point, and the lightning and all that type of thing. But after the giving of the 10 commandments, this is what Moses says, God is testing you, so that the fear of him will remain with you so that you will not have other gods that you will not make an idol and on this earth, that you not take the name of the Lord God and pray that you'll honor your father and mother, and that you will not commit murder and adultery, and that she won't steal and bear false witness against your neighbor, not covet your neighbor's house, or his wife or his servants. The fear of God helps us and it should help these people obey the 10 commandments. And so, again, we need to see the benefit of God's Word in our lives, especially the benefit of fearing God. So sometimes people think well fear, you know, maybe God doesn't want me to have a certain level of happiness or satisfaction in life. And it's just the opposite, that God wants us to fear him for our benefits. So look at verse, verse 12. And Psalm chapter 25. Again, there's so many verses we could look at, says, Who is the man who fears the Lord, look at the benefit, he will instruct him? Will he instruct in the way that he should go? So the benefit of fearing God is instruction, God, God directs our pathway in verse 13, his soul shall abide in well being in his offspring shall inherit the land. So they get this a benefit of fearing God, that God's going to bless individuals who will do that. Verse 14, the New American Standard Version said that the secret of the Lord is for those who fear Him, the ESV puts it this way, the friendship of the Lord is for those who fear him. So the truth is, you want to be a friend of God. Fear Him, reverence him, take him at his word as no again, the friendship of the Lord is for those who fear Him, and He makes note them His covenant. So by fearing God, we can enter into that covenant. And then in verse 15, you said, my eyes are ever toward the Lord, for He will pluck my feet out of the net. There's just countless blessings and benefits that each of us receive, when we learn to sufficiently and properly fear God and reverence His Word. So these are not these are not empty teachings here. These are vital for each one of us. Look at also a scripture in the Old Testament, Proverbs chapter 14. Proverbs chapter 14, verses 26. And 27 says in the fear of the Lord one has strong confidence, you won't have the greatest confidence in your life. I do. I'm confident that you do as well. In some so many times, I think if I can just bolster my self esteem, it will get more knowledge or news, certain things better I can have greater confidence and invariably I may fail in that regard. But it says in the fear of the Lord one has strong confidence, and it says and his children will have your refuge. One reason ended, I want to fear God, and to keep his word is to help my children get to heaven. That's pretty high on my list. I trust his high on your list too. So in the fear of God, one has strong confidence. And his children have a safety net, a refuge, a place of safety. Then he says, the fear of the Lord is a fountain of life, whatever paradox, we think fearing God is going to be stifled,

Mike Roy  20:28
I'm hindered, I'm crippled, I can't do the things I want to do. By fearing God. It's like coming to a life giving fountain you know, you go to these places in a park that this fountain is gushing with water is cool, it's refreshing. It satisfies you in every way. If you jump into that and drink from that, by fearing God, it's like coming to a fountain of life, exactly the opposite of what we oftentimes think, and art with our own mindset. And then look at the theory with the benefit. Again, we're focusing for just a moment on the benefit of fearing God, the fear the Lord is a fountain of life, that one may turn away from the snares of death. You want to avoid the snares of death. You want to avoid eternal condemnation, Fear God, that's the answer. And so, again, the writer of Proverbs is telling us that we need to give that a high priority and see the benefits of benefits of that. And so the reality is, if we all struggle with fear, I struggle with fear. All of us do it different levels at different times. If you fear God, then you can learn not to fear other people. If you have a sufficient and healthy fear of God, you won't be afraid of what other people, other people think about you, or your activity. So again, the third point that I'm making in the lesson this morning is that we've got to see the benefits. The benefits of fearing God are significant. And so we need to focus on those things. One of the points that I want to notice before we wrap up the lesson this morning, so we're talking about holy fear. we're commanded to fear God, we're commanded to be holy, we see the the sense of urgency and priority of practicing these principles in our lives, we see the benefits, but we have to focus on the reward of these commands. So God has our eternal well being in in his heart, when He gives us His commands, I want to go back to our text that we began with. In Hebrews chapter 11. And verse seven. It says that by faith, no will be worn by God about things not yet seen, in reverence, prepared an ark, for the salvation of his household. That's what that's what drove Noah, to do this incredible task of building this massive ark. He wanted to save his family. And that's why we feared God today, because ultimately, and that's my goal in preaching, and I know it is for Jeremy and anybody else who preaches Conrad, the salvation of men and women's souls, we do it imperfectly, obviously is worse as human beings. But this was what was driving Noah to build that ark, he wanted to save his family. And I think the reality is we think about God's commands and the command to be holy, and to interfere him is ultimately we want to experience the eternal salvation. And so there are a lot of immediate benefits that come to us when we fear God and we live holy lives. But we need to focus on the reward so many times in Scripture, that's That's why God gives us such incredible promises. He wants us to think about eternal life, eternal comfort, and eternal salvation that comes through obeying God and His words. And so as we bring the lesson to an end, we really want to leave you with one question. Because this is really what was driving notice life hopefully is driving our lives are we moved by holy fear, to serve God and obey his commands. We, at the end of every sermon, I think, almost felt like exception, we all extend the invitation. And we do that this morning. So to become a Christian, I'll say it for the 1,000th time, that you gotta believe that Jesus is the Messiah, that you must be willing to repent of your sins, you must confess, confess your faith in Him, and then submit the Gods command to be baptized. And when somebody does that, they they become part of God's household. In fact, we witnessed that last night down here, Bryce Boyd made that made that decision to be baptized and Christ we rejoice in that decision to see somebody say,

Mike Roy  24:45
I'm gonna do what God wants me to do. tremendous joy satisfaction to see young people doing that. What keeps some people from not doing what I'm talking about this morning? It is it's a lack of holy Fear, if you believe what God says, And he means what he says, then you'll do exactly what he says. In our culture, people are saved by saying the sinners prayer, that's not true. Never has been true, never will be true. You have to do what God says. And the quality that propels a young person like Bryce or anybody else to get in there. baptistry is a holy fear of God might be that it could be someone here this morning, who hasn't made that decision. And we would encourage you to do so to develop that mindset like no way that I'm going to serve God with a sense of holy fear. If we can assist you this morning we would urge you to respond to the gospel of Christ, and come always stand and sing this invitation song
