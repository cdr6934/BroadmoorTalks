Unknown Speaker  00:03
Okay guys, we are. Well, first of all, we're glad to have you thrilled that you're with us, a good friends of the audience, appreciate your presence. And tonight we're going to talk about in practice Kotori prayers. But what do we even mean by that phrase in practice Kotori prayers. In practice, Tory means cursing. And we mean that in these prayers, we will see the speakers call down judgment or beg God to sin judgment against those who are wicked against those who have hurt them. Now, in practice, Kotori elements are found quite frequently in the Psalms, but it's really a key element in some of these psalms that you see up here on the slide like 50 550-850-9109 is the longest sustained in preparatory prayer, and 137, which pronounces a blessing upon those who dash the heads of little children against the rocks. That language certainly catches our attention. It is not limited to the book of Psalms, it is found several places throughout Scripture. For example, when David is fleeing from Saul, in First Samuel chapter four, the First Samuel 24, in First Samuel 24, he has an opportunity to kill Saul at the cave. And he said, May the Lord Judge between you and me, and may the Lord avenge you or me, but my hand shall not be against you. That's First Samuel 24 Verse 12. So he calls upon the Lord to judge between himself and Saul. So Nehemiah calls down curses up on his foes in Nehemiah four, verses four and five, in Nehemiah six, in verse 14, Jeremiah prays that the Lord would destroy those who have persecuted he'll so severely in Jeremiah 11, in verses 818 through 20. Now, the the predatory prayer that we are going to look at most closely tonight, is Psalm 35. If you haven't opened your Bible here, let me invite you to do that. This is what we want to do. Tonight. In our lesson, we want to read Psalm 35. We want to read the Psalm. And as we read, we'll make a few comments and point out a few things about the tags. Obviously, there's much more about the text that we will get to touch upon. But after we deal with the text a little bit, we want to ask the question, Can Christians ever pray prayers like this today? Or in prayer Kotori prayers out of line for Christians? Or is there a place for them? And then after that, we want to see how does this relate to Jesus? As we have sought to relate the Psalms to Christ? How do we relate this to Christ? Now in the next slide, there's just some information about Psalm 35. Some of the things that will keep coming up, it will keep coming up that the psalmist has been mistreated. He has been persecuted, and particularly some of the part that we will focus on is he calls down curses upon the wicked, he asked for judgment up on the wicked. Then I put that stated in its Lex Tolly Jonas, he likes tall Jonas, to put it quick. To put it simply, is it the punishment fits the crime. Often what he prays to fall upon his enemies or foes is what they have tried to do to him. They've tried to do this to him. And isn't it fitting that that's the punishment if they receive but there are also some notes of praise here. In the text in

Unknown Speaker  04:59
in of Verse eight are verse nine and 10, verse 18, and verse 28. But I'm reading from the New American Standard, and let's read through the text and make some observations as we go. A Psalm of David, contend, oh Lord, with those who contend with me, fight against those who fight against me. That's one of the verses that we listed as Lex Tolley owners. They are contending with me. He says, Lord contend with them. They are fighting against me. And Lord fight against those who fight against me verse to take hold of Buckler and shield and rise up for my help. Draw also the spear and the battleaxe. To me, those who pursue me, say to my soul, I am your salvation. let those be ashamed and Dishonored, who seek my life. Let those be turned back and humiliated, who devise evil against me. Let them be like chaff before the wind, with the angel of the Lord driving them on, let their way be dark and slippery, with the angel of the Lord pursuing the film. Let me pause there just a moment and make a couple of observation observation. Angels are mentioned a few times throughout Psalms but the phrase the angel of the Lord is only used in two Psalms. And interestingly, they're back to back. Psalm 34 uses the phrase the angel of the Lord in verse seven, Psalm 34, verse seven, the angel of the Lord in camps around those who fear Him and rescues them. And now the angel of the Lord is mentioned in 35, verses five and six. I find it interesting that in 34, seven, the angel of the Lord is protecting those who fear God protecting the old rescuing the old in Psalm 35, five and six, the angel of the Lord is pursuing and punishing those who persecute God's people. For seven, for without coals, they have laid their net for me. Without coals they dug a pit for my soul, let destruction come up on him unawares, let the net which he he didn't catch himself into that very destruction, let him fall. Now again, this is a point of Lex Tolly Otis, that punishment fits the crime. You notice in verse seven, that they have hidden a net for healed and dug a pit for healed. And in verse a, he is simply begging that the net that they have laid to try to trap others ends up catching them. This is a common idea in the Psalms, that often the evil doer is trapped by his own devices. Look at Psalm nine, in Psalm nine in verse 15, you see this idea, the nations have sawed down into the pit, which they have made into the net, which they have hid their own foot has been called. Seeing has a boomerang effect. Often the person that it hurts is a person that's planning and plotting and deceiving, and that is what David is asking in Psalm 35. In verse nine, Psalm 35, verse nine, the Bible says in my soul shall rejoice in the Lord, it shall exalt in his salvation, all my bones, will say, Lord, who is like you, who delivers the afflicted from him who is too strong from healed the afflicted and needy from his home, who robs him.

Unknown Speaker  09:47
In verse nine, my soul shall exalt in his salvation. In verse three, he asked God say to my soul, Oh, I am your salvation. So he's begging God to speak to him and say I have your salvation. Now he is praising the Lord for His salvation, I shall exalt in his salvation. Now, also look back at 3420. Do you remember in 3420, we referenced this earlier in the week, he keeps all my bones, not one of the old is broken, he keeps all my bones. And now in verse 10, of Psalm 35, all by bones will say, Lord, who is like you again, there is some purpose behind the placement of the songs in the arrangement in the order that they are in. No one has perfectly uncovered that Lee between every song, but there's a purpose behind it. Who is like the Lord? You may remember that those words were echoed in Exodus 15, in verse 11, by the Israelites when they had crossed the sea, and they had seen the Egyptians drowned, and they burst forth in praise and said, Who is like the Lord. Now the psalmist has experienced a personal Exodus. It is almost as if the sea has crossed for him to pass on dry ground, and his enemies had been judged. Go back to verse 11. Malicious witnesses rise up, they asked me of things I do not know. They repay me evil for good to the bereavement of my soul. But as for me, when they were sick, my clothing was sackcloth. I humbled my Soul, with fasting in my prayer kept returning to my bosom. I went about as though it were my friend or brother, I bow down morning as one who sorrows for a mother and make a mental note of this 13 and 14, we want to come back to this idea that some people say well, I just can't pray these prayers. Because I don't believe that we're supposed to take vengeance. Well, apparently he didn't either. He didn't believe that either. And when they were sick, he was fasting. And he was crying. But there's a difference between taking vengeance in your own hand and asking the God who is infinite in understanding and wisdom to take vengeance in his time in his way, verse 15, in spite of the fact that he had fasted and wept when they faced difficulty, verse 15, but at my stumbling, they rejoiced. They gathered themselves together. The spiders, whom I did not know gathered together against me, they slandered me without ceasing. Like godless gestures at a feast they gnashed at me with their T's. Lord, how long will you look on? rescue my soul from the ravages my only life from the lions, I will give you thanks and the great assembly I will praise you among the Mighty Throne. Do not let those who are wrongfully my enemies rejoice over me. Neither let them hate me who hate me without calls. We maliciously for they do not speak peace, but they devise deceitful words against those who are quiet in the land. They have opened their mouth wide against me. They say A ha ha. Our eyes have seen it. And I think the idea that a ha ha our highs, I've seen it. The idea is that we got something to pin on him now. We got something to convict him up. Now. We've seen it with our eyes.

Unknown Speaker  14:27
I want to tell you, there is so much in this book. We should never run out of sermon material. Let me illustrate that offhandedly. Right here. Aha, aha. How many of you ever heard a good sermon? About a ha? Every time it said in the Bible, it's in a context like this is where the wicked are mocking For godly.

Unknown Speaker  15:10
And they're saying, Ah ha, we called him. We can use this against him. We've seen it. But notice the language in verse 21, verse 22, they say in verse 21, our eyes have seen it. But he appeals to God in verse 22. And says, you have seen it. Oh, Lord, you have seen it. Well, they claim to have seen it. The Lord has always seen it. You have seen it, oh, Lord, do not keep silent. Oh, Lord, do not be far from me. Stir up yourself and await to my right and to my calls my God and my Lord, judge me, O Lord, my God according to your righteousness, and do not let them rejoice over b Do not let them say in their heart, a ha our desire, do not let them say we have swallowed him up. Let those be ashamed and humiliated altogether who rejoice it may distress. Let them be clothed with shame and dishonor, who magnify themselves over me. Let them shout for joy and rejoice with favor in my favor my vindication. Let them say continually, the Lord be magnified, who delights in the prosperity of his servants, and my tongue shall declare your righteousness and your praise all day long. Notice some contrast, in verse 26, we see some who magnify themselves may those be close with shame and dishonor, who magnify themselves over me. But notice the contrast in verse 27, between those who say the Lord be magnified, May those who seek to magnify themselves by Davey brought down May those who say the Lord be magnified, they they, like they rejoice. They they rejoice who look for my vindication, may they be ashamed and humiliated. Who looked for my distress? Can we ask God to bring judgment upon those who persecute us? who oppose us in such a fashion? A lot of the imprint Kotori statements were in the first eight verses or in verse 26. Much of Psalm 35 is describing the mistreatment that called fourth is prayer. Let me give you just a couple of other illustrations from the Psalms. About times you see these type of prayers. Turn with me to Psalm 58. In Psalm 58, Psalm 58, verse six oh god, shatter their teeth in their mouth. Break out the fangs of the young lion break their teeth in their mouth. Now a lion doesn't have any teeth is not going to do nearly as much damage. But to shatter their teeth is certainly a violent act to smash and break them is a violent act and he's praying Oh Lord, shatter their teeth in their mouth. In verse seven. Let them flow away like water that runs off when he aims his arrows let them be as headless shafts in verse a, let them be a snails which melt away as it goes along like the miscarriage, which never sees

Unknown Speaker  19:24
the sign. Let them be like a miscarriage. A strong language. strong language, isn't it? Look at one more Psalm 109 Psalm 109. I'm gonna start with verse eight. Let his days be few and let another take his office.

Unknown Speaker  20:01
Let his children be fatherless and his wife, a widow and let his children wander about and beg and let them seek sustenance, far from their ruin homes now want you to grasp how profound this request is? Let his days be few. But it becomes more direct and more clear in verse nine, let his children be fatherless, his wife, a widow, he is asking for God, to take the lie of this wicked person, take his lie. And may He never his children never be shown kindness. I understand why those words are shocking. To all of us who remember the Lord's words, Father, forgive them, for they don't know what they do. In Luke 2334, Stephen, when he was being stoned, pray to similar thing, Lord, do not lay this sin against them. And I want to tell you what I'm seeking to do tonight. I'm not seeking to eliminate those two passages I just mentioned, Luke 2334, and x 759. And 60. I'm not seeking to take them out of scripture. But I am saying we must look at all of Scripture, we must take it all into consideration. We must take all of God's revelation, because when we do we understand it. I don't think it's contradictory at all. I don't think it's contradictory. But I understand the difficulty with relating. Now, I'm not going to ask you. How many of you think that we can pray a prayer like this today? Or how many do not I'm not gonna ask you that, if you will, and you still might disagree afterwards, and you want to express that disagreement? That's fine. But the most common objection that I hear among brethren, who would say these wouldn't be acceptable today would be that they were okay in Old Testament times, but they're not okay, today. I do think there are several problems with that view. First of all, in the Old Testament, God's people were still told to love their enemies. If you see your enemies ox or donkey going astray, you were to keep it for him, or you were to help it bear its burden in Exodus 23, verses four and five. In Proverbs 25, verses 21 and 22. If your enemy is hungry, feeding, if he's thirsty, give him a drink. For In so doing, you will heap coals of fire on its head. If you remember that verse before. You remember that verse? And you usually remember that verse from were not from Proverbs 25. They usually remember that from Romans 12, don't you? When Paul was talking to Christians, telling them to love their enemies, he could do no better than to quote the Old Testament and say what it said, on the subject. So the Old Testament, called God's people, to love their enemies. And these psalms, we saw that before in Psalm 35, verses 13 and 14, these psalms do this. And the Old Testament condemns personal vengeance. Some people ask me, oh, what about the avenger of blood? They feed your blood is not an exception to this. The avenger of blood was a person from a family who was charged with responsibilities of caring for the family when they are poor, or righting a wrong that had been done a family but the avenger of blood only acted if the after the person had stood trial after a bit after there have been multiple witnesses to convict him of role. I want you to listen to this passage in Proverbs 20 And verse 22. In Proverbs 20, verse 22, the Bible says, Do not say I will repay evil, wait for the Lord and He will save you. Now again, does that sound like the Old Testament is encouraging personal vengeance do not say I will repay evil wait for the Lord, and He will save you. wait on God, what does it mean? Wait,

Unknown Speaker  25:15
wait, wait on the Lord does it mean it's different things in different context. But I'll tell you what it means in Proverbs 20, verse 22, it means we don't take vengeance against those who do wrong to us.

Unknown Speaker  25:31
We wait on Him. Psalm 35. Psalm 109, in particular, Psalms of David. Twice, David had opportunity to kill Saul. Saul comes into a cave, all David's men are lined against the back of a cave. When you come in from the light to the darkness, your eyes

Unknown Speaker  26:08
don't adjust quickly, and you can't see anything. He thinks he's all alone. David's men have been in the cave, and they are in the back in the darkness looking out toward the light. And they see Saul. And some of David's men say to him, this is the day that the Lord spoke to you about to go up and take vengeance on him kill him. And David takes his sword. And he goes over to Saul and he strikes the edge of his route. And his conscience bothered him. Because he took the edge of Saul's robe. And when solo leaves the cave, he says My Lord, the key, you've listened to me and who have told you that I'm trying to kill you. But right now I had opportunity to kill you and I didn't do it. Look here, a part of your robe in my hand. To David, take personal vengeance, or the David wait on the Lord. The Old Testament condemns personal vengeance. Some ask what about Jesus statement in Matthew five you have heard it said An eye for an eye and a two for two. But I say to you do not resist evil. Jesus is not contradicting Jesus is not contrasting what he is saying with the law. I don't think that's what's happening. I think he's contrasting what what he is teaching with how some people interpreted that and mis interpreted that some people use that statement, an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, which was given to judges to tell them how to make the punishment fit the crime. They were using that as an excuse for vengeance. And Jesus said you can't do that. But the New Testament if we're gonna say, well, the Old Testament does this and it's okay. In the New Testament. We can't do it. The New Testament has curses like this too. If I or an angel from heaven, preach to you any other gospel that I have preached, let him be accursed. Galatians one, verses eight and nine. And even saints in the presence of God in Revelation six, verses nine and 10 are crying, How long? Oh Lord, take you judge and avenge our blood on them who dwell on earth. Did you all? Notice anything about the words of Psalm 109? Verse eight, a moment ago, Psalm 109, verse a, let his days be few. And let another take his office. Some of you recognize those are words that are quoted by Peter, about Judas and his sin. In Acts one, verse 20. The point is the New Testament, even quote these in preparatory sections of the old Psalm 69, verses 22 and 23. Let their table be a snare to the old is quoted in Romans 11 and the New Testament rejoices at the fall of the wicked. There are few Hebrew words which have made their way into our vocabulary. One that has is the word Amen. Let it be so war, word for truth, word for faithfulness, things of that nature. Another English word, another Hebrew word, it's made its way into our vocabulary is hallelujah. Hillel is praise. And yah is a shortened form of Yahweh, or Jehovah when we talked about the other night. But the term hallelujah is use four times the New Testament, four times, all of them are revelation 19, one through six. And you know why they are singing? Hallelujah, they are saying Hallelujah. They are saying Hallelujah, because the great harlot Rome, has been destroyed. There's still a place for the righteous to rejoice at judgment upon the wicked.

Unknown Speaker  31:14
I think I am going to ask you to raise your hand here. How many of you have ever at some point in your life? Maybe you face personal problems? Maybe it was some other friend of yours? Or maybe you just shook your head in dismay at the wickedness of our world.

Unknown Speaker  31:42
And you prayed, Lord, come quickly. If you if you've ever pray those prayers, do we realize when we pray those prayers, that we're also praying for judgment to come on the wicked? For Second Thessalonians one, verses five through 10, the Lord will come in flaming fire taking vengeance on them that no not God and obey not the gospel. But those who are His will be gathered to Him. Several years ago, I was in a town in a meeting. It wasn't the town where I taught college classes, but it was in another town and and a person told me that in the first day of engineering class, and it seems strange to me in an engineering class, you can tell me if this is strange to you all. But a teacher said there's no right. And there is no role. Now, how would you like to drive over a bridge that he made? And you know what I would do on that first first day of class, I'd make a note of as he said that, if he ever marked an answer on my tests wrong, I would go and see what you said, there's no right and no wrong and you can mark this wrong. But our schizophrenic society will meeting times mocking any kind of standard and laughing any kind of standard, and there's no right. There's no role. And you even have prominent atheists who will proclaim this and they will preach this. And yet, when you find a deranged young man going into a school and shooting a bunch of young people, everyone discovers that there's wrong all of a sudden, everybody knows that's wrong. Evil is real, evil is real. And we should be outraged by it. Is there virtue, sometimes in being calm and be moderate? Yes. Are there situations that call for outrage? Absolutely. Through Your precepts, I get understanding, and therefore I hate every false way. We should be outraged by evil, but we do not avenge ourselves. Several these passages we have introduced before. Second Timothy four verse 14, Paul said Alexander Under the Coppersmith did be much arm. So as Paul's gonna go out and get even with him, No, Paul says the Lord

Unknown Speaker  35:08
will reward him in that day we do not avenge ourselves. Thankfully, I haven't faced too many challenges to this. I hope you have an either

Unknown Speaker  35:31
desire and we must always pray for God's desire to the glory of God, the desire V for God to be glorified. Why did these men pray in preparatory prayers? They said in verse 10, The righteous will rejoice when he sees this is Psalm 5810, and 11, Psalm 5810, and 11, the righteous will rejoice when he sees the vengeance, he will wash his feet in the blood of the wicked, and men will say, Surely there is a reward for the righteous, Surely there is a God who judges in the earth. What I'm trying to stress in these in, let me encourage you to take down all those passages to read them all. All of those passages. Say there's a burning desire for God's name to be glorified, for God to be honored and praised, behind these prayers. I think taking these problems to God, is exactly what we can do. Because God is all wise God is infinite in His understanding God may know who may be led to his truth later, God is not going to act in response to our prayers in a way that he knows is not right. But we can take our problems to Him, knowing that he is the only one big enough to help and strong enough to say, Now am I saying throw out the fact that we pray for our enemies that we desire their salvation. It's interesting to me that Stephens prayer Lord, do not lay this sin to their charge is followed in X eight and X nine by the conversion of Paul, to some degree, Paul's conversion is an answer to Stephens prayer. Now, we still pray those prayers. And I think we can pray them in the same prayer, Lord, have mercy upon those, as you have mercy upon me. Lord, bring down those who oppose you, and who cannot be turned, and who are leading people to evil. Now, you may disagree with that, and you're welcome to just think about it. And if you want to ask me something about it, you can, but we we've still got a couple of minutes to deal with. How do they use relate to Jesus? And I want you to see that all the persecution that David mentions in Psalm 35 was experienced by Jesus. All of it was experienced by Jesus and more, just as he was. They were his enemies without calls. So they hated Jesus without a colles John 1525 as false witnesses arose against Hillman ask him about things he did not know who experienced false witnesses who experienced that difficulty any more than Jesus did. They repaid Jesus evil for good. I want to tell you that passage in Luke 2251, this company of people have come to arrest Jesus. Peter uses his sword strikes off mouth because his ear, Jesus says, Put up your sword those that live by the sword will perish for the sole word and he heals the ear of the man who came to arrest heal.

Unknown Speaker  39:26
Don't you think? If you'd been in that crowd that had come to arrest Jesus, that would make you think. What was his cry? He went about doing good. Acts 1038 says, he went about doing good and healing those oppressed by the devil, and for that they crucified him. He mourned and grieved over those who wicked, Oh Jerusalem, Jerusalem that stones that kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to you how often I would have gathered you as a hen gathers her cheeks under her wings, but you would not. And he committed his case to God. And more could be said about how Jesus experienced all the mistreatment that David explains in describes in Psalm 35. And more for David was delivered, and Jesus was crucified. But Jesus did not call down a curse upon those who did evil. Instead, he prayed, Father forgive them. For they don't know what they're doing. God help us to be like that. Do you remember the passage? It's in Psalm 14, one in Psalm 53. One, The fool has said in his heart, there is no God. Do you remember that passage? fool has said in his heart, there is no God. You know, that's quoted in the New Testament. That's quoted in Romans three, verses 10 through 12. And what Paul's point is in Romans three, verses 10, through 12. His point is that we have all sinned, and fallen short of God's glory, all of us. Every person here, including myself, unfortunately, has at some point, made a decision acting as if God didn't exist, that we were not accountable to him, and we would never stand before Him in judgment. That passage convicts us all. Because we've all cast him out of our presence. And Jesus took the curse up on him that we deserve. Cursed is the one who hangs on a tree, Deuteronomy 21, verses 22 and 23. He says, And he took our curse for us. Jesus experienced the curse. He overcame death, by the fact God raised Him from the dead, but he experienced the curse to deliver us from the curse of sin, and death. Now, there are other parallels I can make between the Psalm and Jesus. If you want to ask afterwards, I could give you a couple of more, but I know we're running out of time. But I do want to mention one more thing. Look at verse. Verse 25, of Psalm 35. So I'm 3525 Do not let them say in their death, a ha. Our desire, do not let them say, do not let them say we have swallowed him up. Here David is begging just do not let my enemy say they have swallowed me up to you know that the word used in the Greek translation, the main Greek translation of the Old Testament, for swallowed up is is the same word used in the New Testament Greek in these two passages.

Unknown Speaker  44:13
When this perishable will have put on the imperishable, and this mortal will put on immortality, then we'll come about the same that is written, Death is swallowed up in victory as First Corinthians 1554 in Second Corinthians five and verse four, for indeed we while we are in this tent, we groan being burdened because we want to be because we do, we do not want to be unclothed, but to close so that that which is mortal is swallowed up by life. My point here, David Biggs, don't let them swallow me up. Jesus, in a sense was swallowed up that he died But he was raised. And in that act, he swallowed up death and defeated it. Oh death? Where is your staying? Oh grave? Where is your victory? I hope I've done enough to connect the dots. But may this lead us to stay in all of Jesus,

Unknown Speaker  45:21
let us pray. Oh Lord our God we have all been mistreated and marked at some point. And all of us have bought and mistreated you and acted as if you didn't exist. We thank You that You sent your son, your only son to absorb

Unknown Speaker  46:06
all the hatred, all the animosity that we had thrown your way and to deal with it, to open the door of salvation and live, how you can turn the disaster of our sins. To show the beauty of your love and the glory of your salvation. It is beyond us to figure out to you Oh God, be all the glory and all the praise in Jesus name. Amen. Lord willing tomorrow night we want to talk about Psalm 37 and wisdom Psalms and how they relate to Christ. Thank you
