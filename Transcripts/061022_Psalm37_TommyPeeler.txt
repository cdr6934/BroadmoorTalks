Unknown Speaker  00:01
Open your Bibles, if you would, to Psalm 37. Thank you so much for being here tonight. Thank you so much for being here this week, and for listening so closely, as we sought to explain the psalms that we've gone over this week. And to view them in the bigger picture of the whole Bible. Thank you so much, you have been a very, very good listening audience. As far as I can tell, and thank you so much for that encouragement, no better thing we can do together than the look at his word together. And thank you so much for just the privilege of being with you all, you all have capable elders who teach and capable preachers who preach, and thank you all for giving me the opportunity for it's been a blessing to be a part of that. And Kevin and Karen, have been very gracious host as well. And it's been good to, to be with them. There's a lot more I could and should say. But God bless you all. And thank you for all the kindness, the hospitality and the courtesy that you shown this week. And after we have our final prayer Norm said he was going to say a couple of things to the group. So that would be a little different procedure than the rest of the week. But let's look at Psalm 37. Let's look at Psalm 37. And Psalm 37, we would characterize as a wisdom Psalm, and wisdom Psalms deal a lot more with teaching men, teaching others than they do with praise to God. It's not so much an emphasis on praise to God or thanks to God, but the emphasis is on addressing men in their difficulties. Some classic examples of wisdom, Psalms, Psalm 37, that we're looking at tonight, and Psalm 73, as well. Both of them deal with the problem of the prosperity of the wicked. The writer says in Psalm 73, that he almost lost his faith at the prosperity of the wicked. But he recognized to that he has a blessing the wicked did not have what have I in heaven, but you in besides you desire nothing on earth. Also a theme in these wisdom Psalms, some of the themes are there's a strong contrast between the righteous and the wicked, and that's going to come out in Psalm 37. Particularly, it's going to come out in Psalm 73. The point of it the futility of putting our trust in reaches, that is something that is a main theme of Psalm 79. But there are different types of Wisdom literature. The book of Proverbs contains a lot of short, pithy statements that summarize truth, as proverbial or lower wisdom. And then Ecclesiastes deals with higher wisdom as it searches for the meaning of life. And Job is a higher wisdom is a sense that it is dealing with Why do the righteous suffer? Let me also mention here a kind of subcategory of wisdom Psalms, and that is torah Psalms, in like I said, they may be a subcategory in this bigger category of wisdom Psalms, but those emphasize the law of the Lord. Psalm one, the blessing man meditates in the law of the Lord day and night in Psalm 19, beginning with verse seven, the law of the Lord is perfect, converting the soul excetera in Psalm 119, the amazing Psalm and alphabetic acrostic, which goes through the whole Hebrew alphabet, praising the law of God. Now, any of the PowerPoints that I've given to you all this week, you know, David's free to send them out to everyone if y'all have a mass mailing scheme, if that will help you. Let it help you

Unknown Speaker  05:02
But let's, before we get into Psalm 37. And I hesitate sometimes on this, do you give these things before or afterwards, but I want you to give them before because I want you to see, I think that's about 14 times in Psalm 37, that you see the word wicked. And about nine times in Psalm 37, that you see the word righteous. There are other places in Psalm 37, that you see that idea, but it may use a different word may use like the evil doer for the wicked. It may use a different word for the righteous. This Psalm is going to contrast the character of the righteous verse, the character of the wicked. But I think the main point that is being contrasted in Psalm 37, is the destiny of the righteous verse, the destiny of the wicked, the wicked are said to be cut off, that's going to be found five times throughout the Sol, the wicked are cut all the righteous, inherit the land, and that also is found five times. Now you find other things that have that idea, but don't use the same word. For example, in verses wanting to do not fret because of evil doers. Be not envious toward wrongdoers, they will wither quickly like the grass and fade like the green herb. That's not the same expression cut off, but he shows us their final destiny, they're going to dry up, they're not going to be productive, they're not going to bear fruit. So as we go throughout notice the difference between the righteous and the wicked, a difference in their character, and a difference in their destiny. This is what we want to do. Like we did last night, we want to read Psalm 37. And no one has a longer reading. But I know too, there is great value in reading the Word of God, nothing. No part of the sermon is sure to be correct as the par or you're just reading the Word. So we're going to read the Word and we're going to offer as we read the word, little brief notes about some of the verses. I do want you in addition to what we have on the PowerPoint here to be asking this question for why is he writing this? What is he pointing out? What is he teaching? What's the main point? Who would be the audience he would be addressing? And what would be their circumstances? Now? Is that always easy to determine? Not always. Unless the rider just comes out and says it is sometimes the rider will say it. Many other signs the Jesus in the presence of his disciples that are not written in this book. But these that are written are written that you might believe that Jesus is the Christ and believing have lived through his name, John 2030, and 31. John comes out and tells us why he's writing. The writer of Psalm 73 will not be that clear, that direct and that focused. But I do think we can come up with a pretty good idea. As we look through this song, about his writing, why he's writing and what he's seeking to convey. One other point I should have mentioned, before we start reading, we stated before this is a wisdom saw. One of the things about wisdom literature, is wisdom. Literature is often written from the point of experience. For example, when you get to the book of Proverbs, you do not find the phrase that says the Lord In the Book of Proverbs, does that mean it's not inspired? No. It's inspired. But often the observations come through experience God is guiding him through experience to write these things. I looked, I observed the field of the sluggard. In Proverbs 24, you had the same thing in Psalm 37. One of the reasons I mentioned it, look at verse 25, Psalm 37, verse 25, I have been young, and now I am old, yet I have not seen the righteous forsaken or his descendants begging bread. Do you see the level experience he is saying, This is my experience. I've been young now I'm old. And this is my experience. I have not seen the righteous forsaken a verse itself that we could ask questions about, but let's go back to Psalm 37 verse one, let's read the text and make a few comments on it. And then try to draw some lessons from it. A Psalm of David, do not fret because of evil doers. Be not envious toward wrongdoers, for they will wither quickly like the grass and fade like the green herb all flesh is as grass and all the glory of man is the flower of grass, the grass withers, the flower fades but the word of the Lord abides forever. Isaiah 40 verses six through a verse three. Notice the imperatives trust in the Lord and do good. dwell in the land and cultivate faithfulness. Delight yourself in the Lord and He will give you the desires of your heart, Commit your way to the Lord, trust also in healed and he will do it he will bring forth Your righteousness as the light and your judgment as the noon day rest in the Lord and wait patiently for Him. Do not fret because of he'll who prospers in his way, because of the man who carries out wicked schemes.

Unknown Speaker  12:23
cease from anger and do cease from anger and forsake wrath. Do not fray it, it leads only to evildoers. Trust in the Lord can be your way to go, Lord, verse three, verse five, trust in the Lord with all your heart, lean, not in your own understanding, in all your ways acknowledge Him, He will direct your path, Proverbs three, five and six. Notice verse four, verse, verse four has been subject to abuse, delight yourself in the Lord, and He will give you the desires of your heart. The idea behind the US is not that you delight yourself in the Lord, and you're gonna have to find his car and you're gonna have to find his home, and you're going to experience all the luxuries of life. Now we have been very abundantly blessed. In most of us drove here tonight, if not all of us, and we have nice homes to live in. But the idea of this passage, delight yourself in the Lord, and He will give you the desires of your heart, may God your highest delight, your highest goal, your deepest aspiration, your most intense longing. And he will give you, himself to light yourself in the Lord. As Psalm 73 said, and we alluded to earlier, who have I in heaven, but you, and besides you, I desire nothing on earth. In verses 25 and 26, and Psalm 73, he recognizes he has a blessing that the wicked does not have verse nine, evildoers will be cut off. It's one of our key terms. But those who wait for the Lord, they will inherit the land notice the contrast in their destinies firsthand. You had a little while and the wicked man will be no more and you will look carefully for his place, and he will not be there but the humble will inherit the land and delight themselves in abundant prosperity. In verse 12, the wicked plots against the righteous and now As you sit him with his teeth, here's a big difference in character between the wicked person and the righteous person, the wicked plots against the righteous and Nash's at him with his teeth. Do you remember last night when we're looking at Psalm 35? The Bible says in verse 16, Psalm 35 Verse 16, like godless gestures at a feast, they gnashed at me with their teeth, gnashing of teeth. In the Bible like was done by the enemies of Steven against Hillman X seven, verse 54. When people gnashed their teeth in the Bible, they are filled with intense anger, intense defiance of God and of His people. What does it mean? It hell. There's weeping, gnashing of teeth. It is a place where God is hated. It's not a statement so much about the pain of the people in hell. It's a statement

Unknown Speaker  16:13
of their hostility to God. But in verse 13, the Lord laughs at him, for he sees his day is coming. The wicked have drawn the sword and bent the their bow to cast down the afflicted and the needy. to slay those who are upright in conduct their sword will enter their own heart and their bows will be broken. This is what we talked about last night, in the principle of Lex Tolley onus that they are punished in the way that they had sought to punish others. They are, they are shoot, they are bending their bow ready to shoot their arrows and who they end up killing in verse 14 and 15 is themselves their sword will enter their own heart for 60. Better is the little of the righteous than the abundance of the wicked than the above than the abundance of many wicked, for the arms of the wicked will be broken. But the Lord sustains the righteous. The Lord knows the day of the blameless and their inheritance will be forever. They will not be ashamed at the time of evil. And in the day of famine, they will have an abundance, but the wicked will perish. And the enemies of the Lord will be like the glory of the pastures they vanish, like smoke, they vanish. The wicked borrows and does not pay back but the righteous is gracious and gives notice that contrast in character. The wicked is borrowing the wicked is not giving the righteous is gracious and giving. Verse 22. For those blessed by Hill will inherit the land. But those cursed by Hill will be cut all the steps of a man are established by the Lord and He delights in His ways. When he falls, he shall not be hurled headlong, because the Lord is the one who holds his hand. I have been young and now I am old. Yet I have not seen the righteous forsaken or his descendants begging begging bread all day long. He is gracious and Linz and his descendants are a blessing. Verse 27, depart from evil, do good, so that you will not so that you will abide forever. For the Lord loves justice and does not forsake his godly ones. They are preserved forever, but the descendants of the wicked will be cut off the righteous will inherit the land and dwell in it forever. The mouth of the righteous utters wisdom and he's Tong speaks justice. The law of his God is in his heart his steps do not slip up the wicked spies upon the righteous and seeks to kill him. The Lord will not leave him in his hand or let him be condemned when he is judge. Wait for the Lord and keep His way and He will exalt you to inherit the land. When the wicked are cut off. You will see it. Verse 35. I have seen a wicked violent man spreading himself like a luxuriate tree and its native soil that he passed away and lo he was no more I saw for him, but he could not be found. Mark the blameless man, and behold the upright for a man of peace will Have a posterity. But transgressors will be all together destroy the past, the posterity of the wicked will be cut off. But the salvation of the righteous is from the Lord. He is their strength in time of trouble. The Lord helps the home and delivers the home, he delivers the home from the wicked and saves the home because they take refuge in him. While there's so much more there, that we can begin to scratch a surface. And I hope what we do tonight, and what we've done to this week simply spurs you to read these more fully, to study them more deeply. And to think through them more intensely.

Unknown Speaker  20:58
What's the point of writing this song? What is this song seeking to communicate? Now I want to tell you pretty clearly something that I think we can all agree is not the purpose of this psalm. Type that passage I mentioned right before we started reading, I have been young, and now I am old. I have never seen the righteous forsaken, or his descendants begging bread. Doesn't that sound like the kind of verse that Job's friends would have quoted? I had been young. Now I'm out. I've never seen the righteous forsaken, nor his descendants begging bread to obviously that's an inspired message right here. What's the difference between this and what Job's friends say? In the book of Joe. The purpose of this passage is not a lesson to us, to help us distinguish who is righteous and who is wicked. It's not telling us to keep records for ourselves, okay, I saw this person begging for bread, haha, he must be wicked. The point is not that that is not the purpose of the passage, nor is the purpose of verses like 3030 to the mouth, the righteous utters wisdom, His tongue speaks justice, the law of God is in his heart, he steps do not slip up the wicked spies upon the righteous and seeks to kill Him, the Lord will not leave him in his hand, or let him be condemned when he is judge. Could you look at that language and say, when the wicked person is condemned? Obviously, he's guilty, and he's done something to deserve it? No. Is there such a thing as innocent suffering? Sure, there he is. It is interesting. If you look in the book of Job, and you really try to think closely about why what the friends are saying is wrong. They're not wrong, because they connect sin. There is a connection from the first chapters of Genesis, Oh, God. But we can't always connect an individual's personal sin. With their personal suffering. We can't tell who is righteous and who is wicked, based on their life experiences and whether or not they have an easy life and whether or not they are financially blessed. We cannot make those decisions on the basis of that, but but the point is, if you look at some of the things that Job's friends say they say some things that are just like the book of Proverbs, let me give you an illustration. In Job 18, verse five, Bill dad said, the lamp of the righteous or excuse me, the lamp of the wicked is put out, the lamp of the wicked is put out, that's job 18 Verse five. Now that statement in itself is true. That statement itself is true. You know why? I know it's true, because it's found in Proverbs. In Proverbs 13, verse nine, the light of the righteous rejoices but the law Help of the wicked goes out in Proverbs 20 Verse 20, he who curses his father or his mother, his loud will go out in time of darkness. Proverbs 24, verse 20, do not be proverbs 24 Verse 24, there will be no future for the evil man for the lamp of the wicked will go out what is the difference between Bill dad statement in job 18 Five in those three statements in Proverbs, the difference is their intent, their purpose, the purpose of build, and in quoting that statement, is to say job is wicked, or he wouldn't be experiencing these things, his lamp wouldn't be going out His purpose is to identify job as wicked.

Unknown Speaker  25:56
Or the Bible has a different purpose. Now, let's go into another thing. That is not the purpose of this passage. Some people say, and I don't think this bears a careful reading. Some people say Oh, Psalm 37 Just promises too much. It promises that the life of the righteous will always be easy. Does it? Does it promised the life of the righteous will always be easy givers 12. The wicked plots against the righteous and Nash's hit him with his teeth. Sometimes people hate the righteous for no other reason, except that they are righteous. The same thing is stated in verse 14 In verse 16, the Bible says better is the little of the righteous than the abundance of many wicked, it may be in life, you may have to make a decision. You may have to make a decision between doing the right thing and having relatively little and doing the wrong thing and having great abundance. This passage shows that and he tells us if that is your decision. If that is your choice, then it's better to have a little and be righteous than to experience the abundance of many wicked. In verse 32. The text tells us the wicked spies on the righteous and seeks to kill him again a statement that the wicked persecute the righteous in verse 39, the Bible tells us that the righteous experience is a time of trouble. So the point is Psalm 37 Doesn't always tell us if your righteous your lie is going to be easy. Does it tell us that now? It does make things work out a little bit better in the end, than might always be the case and we'll talk about that

Unknown Speaker  28:18
in a second as well. What was the purpose? In the psalmist world and in our world sometimes wickedness pays wicked this pays off, doesn't it? Verse one. Why would you be told not to fret because of evildoers are not the envious toward wrongdoers?

Unknown Speaker  29:02
Unless there was something that looks like success. This song talks about the prosperity of the wicked. The Psalm talks about the abundance of many wicked is verse 16 points out and verse 35. Talks about the wicked violent man like a luxuriant tree, spreading its native soil. Now, I've spoken here about a lot of things. It's not the purpose of the song, or the psalm says. This is what I wanted to build up to. What I think the purpose of this song is we live in a world They lived in a world where it sometimes seems why the wicked prosper, and the weekend get ahead, and the righteous suffer. And this is telling us, in the midst of our world like this, when the wrong seems all so strong, to remember, God is the Ruler yet we the wrong is so strong, and the wicked seem to prosper and the righteous suffer. And worse than that the wit the righteous suffer at the hands of those wicked who are prospering. It is telling us in spite of this, don't be deceived. It is the way of the righteous that will inherit the land. It is the way of the wicked that will be cut off. And so keep doing good. Keep delighting yourself and God keep pursuing what is right and good and holy, because in spite of how things look, that is the path a blessing I'd hate to use this illustration if you by younger was here, in a way

Unknown Speaker  31:37
but recently, a few years ago, a man passed away in this country he lived to be over 90 years old. He made his living by introducing pornography into this country and promoting it and living an

Unknown Speaker  32:08
ungodly horrible life he was lauded by The Press He was viewed as some kind of hero by the media

Unknown Speaker  32:29
don't fret when the wicked prosper Don't fret. You see his house. You see his mansion spread out. You're gonna look pretty soon and it's gonna be gall.

Unknown Speaker  32:54
And there's not going to be any memory of the wicked person. In the midst of a world where wickedness seems to pay off and the wickedness have the respect and the wicked have the accolades and they're exalted. Don't follow that path, because that path is the path of destruction. They will be cut

Unknown Speaker  33:21
off. But he's the righteous who will be bled? Does it always look that way? Does it always look that way? In our world a preacher told me these two stories several years ago

Unknown Speaker  33:50
two men are Christians. They encounter almost identical circumstances at work. The first man

Unknown Speaker  34:02
the first man at his place of employment, see something that looks like dishonesty. He wants to make sure before he makes an accusation.

Unknown Speaker  34:23
Over time, he keeps looking he keeps watching. And it becomes undeniably true. Something he can't deny that this is dishonesty. He goes to the heads of his company. He points this out. They look into it. They find what he said is true. They publicly praise him and get rid of the wrongdoers. Sometimes you stand for God in everything works out. But in a second illustration, almost identical circumstances. Excel, this person who discovered dishonesty in the company was already so high up in the company, that he had a position in the company for which he could not be fired. And he saw dishonesty. And he wants to make sure that this was right before he made the accusation. And he looked at when he could deny it no more, he goes and presents the his higher ups what happened.

Unknown Speaker  35:48
And then you Oh. They begin to threaten him. He said, You can't fire me. He said, though we can't. But we have our way. And if you mind, his position, was just eliminated. And his enormous salary that he was blessed with at the time

Unknown Speaker  36:26
disappeared. Sometime you stand for God, and everything falls into place. And people praise you. And sometimes, you stand for why, and you're mad at the villain. And you lose everything in the process. What Psalm 37 says, is do good. Delight yourself in the Lord. cease from anger and forsake wrath, Commit your way to the Lord, trust in the Lord. Keep doing good in spite of how life appears, in spite of how it appears, because ultimately the wicked will be cut off. And the righteous will inherit the land. The psalm doesn't go into specifics of how all that's going to happen. But he tells us disobedience and wickedness is the road to disaster, and we would say damnation.

Unknown Speaker  37:40
Righteousness is the way to blessing and to eternal life. So this psalm addresses a world like our world, in the midst of our wicked world, in the midst of our ungodly world, and it's not it's ungodly here as it is some places.

Unknown Speaker  38:07
And some of us have been blessed to do difficult things and to not suffer much for him. Many of us have many in this audience. Even what you all were doing, Saturday handing out Bibles,

Unknown Speaker  38:39
will be illegal in some countries. And so we are greatly blessed, but in the midst of our world, for wickedness is rewarded, and righteousness is punished. Keep doing good. Now, why don't we make some of these promises here? Looking at verses 30 through 33, again 30 through 33. The mouth of the righteous utters wisdom, His tongue speaks justice, the law of God is in his heart his steps do not steal the wicked spies upon the righteous and seeks to kill him. The Lord will not leave his home in his hand or let him be condemned when he is judge. Joseph this week, the children have been studying accused of adultery. When he refused to commit adultery. He ends up spending time in prison. That's not maybe what you would expect from reading those verses. Let me tell you something else that's even worse than that. There was a man who was blessed by God, with an inheritance from God with a piece of land from God that was productive. He just had the misfortune of having a really wicked neighbor. And his neighbor said to him, would you give me your piece of land, if you will give me this piece of land, you give me your vineyard, I will sell you another piece of land, I'll give you another equal piece of land or, or I'll give it the amount in cash. And he said, I will not depart with the Lord's inheritance. Well, the problem with neighbor though is it is key that his neighbor was the king. It was King Ahab. And Ahab goes home sulking, and when he goes home sulking, Jezebel says, What are you talking about? He says, Hey, Boss, give me his veto. And she said, You're the king of Israel, I'll get that vineyard for you. And so she writes a letter, and she puts a chip seal on it in order to authenticate the letter. And the letter says that you put NightBot in the midst of a call a fast, and you put in a bath in a prominent spot, and you have a couple of worthless men stand up and say, Neighbor has cursed God and the king. And you take him out, and you stone him. And you know, they got always stoned and killed neighbor, they not only follow those wicked plans to perfection. They killed his sons as well, that detail is added in Second Kings 924 through 26. They killed him, they killed his son, so there would be no air. So the property would go to the key Ahab and Jezebel says Get up Ahab's dead, that vineyard yours. He was condemned when he was judged. But you know, what, Jesus, how he helps us with this. How does this relate to Jesus, for Jesus was condemned when he was charged as well. A matter of fact, what we just described about neighbors at the hands of Ahab and Jezebel in First Kings 21 verses one through 16. There are some things about his trial that sound a lot like Jesus trial. But Jesus was not delivered in the midst of all these false accusations. The wicked spied upon he'll the ultimate righteous one, and they succeeded in having him crucified. But you know what the rest are. Jesus teaches us what Jesus death and resurrection teaches us. Jesus death and resurrection teach us that even if vindication never comes in this life, it will go

Unknown Speaker  43:16
Joseph was vindicated in this life, at 30 years old, raised up to be the ruler of Egypt, his brothers come bowing before him, just as he dreamed several years before Joseph experienced vindication in this life. But nabe off didn't, his sons didn't. But how Jesus stretches this Psalm and expands the meaning of this psalm is he shows us that in spite of the fact that wicked may prosper for a whole lifetime, and the righteous may be afflicted for all their days, steal,

Unknown Speaker  43:55
the righteous will be vindicated and the wicked will be cut off I'm not going to change part with that pornography spewer, 90 year plus multi billionaire on the day of judgment

Unknown Speaker  44:21
I don't want to trade places with him I'd rather live a simple life at follow the Lord the wicked will be cut off the righteous will inherit the land. One of the verses we used in class I think we used in class the other day maybe it was Sunday night's sermon, but Psalm 3419 and 20. The righteous will have many troubles, but the Lord delivers them from his all from them all, he will not allow one of his bones to be broken. And we stated that in John 1936 Is Jesus died on the cross it he said it fulfilled the scripture that not a bone will be broken. And I think that fulfills the image of the Passover lamb from Exodus 1246, as well, but it also fulfills the idea of the righteous suffer Psalms, to think about the fact that this idea of Jesus and none of his bones being broken, is referred to here in the sense of what looks like a defeat. What looks like a defeat. But the resurrection of Jesus teaches us that even if we never see the rewards of obedience and righteousness in this life,

Unknown Speaker  45:57
thank God we will see them. Let us pray. Oh Lord our God, we live in the midst of an evil world.

Unknown Speaker  46:17
And most of us in this room, certainly I know I have had been shielded from the worst parts and the most intense suffering in it.

Unknown Speaker  46:30
And yet, even then we cry out sometimes how long Oh, lord. We've been shielded from much pain and from much suffering.

Unknown Speaker  46:42
But we've seen enough to know that the wicked seem to prosper and be praised. All the righteous seem to be afflicted suffer. Help us to continue to trust you, and to do right, in spite of how the world will help us to teach the young people and this church as it is filled with young people. May these young people in these classes and others that go through these doors regularly. May they see that righteousness is the path of blessing in spite of how the world might look at any given moment. Help us to remember that you will ultimately call the wicked to account and you will call the righteous to live with you eternally. To you God, be all the glory, all the wisdom and all praise in Jesus name. Amen.
