Unknown Speaker  00:01
I'm very glad to be here tonight. Thank you very much for giving me the opportunity to talk about some of the things that I think Paul would tell us today. I don't know that he would change all that much, I when you think about cities, most cities throughout history have been pretty much the same the the people and in most cities are going to have very similar problems. And when you think about the more metropolitan areas in the United States, the equivalent of those would be a place like Corinth or Rome and the ancient world. And so tonight, what I thought we would do is we would look at some of the things that Paul says in the letter of the Romans, and one idea in particular, that if he were here talking to us, I think he would tell us, it's a theme that shows up a couple of times in the letter to the Romans, is that there are no excuses. And when we, when we hear that, I often think of the idea of there being no excuse for for failure. Coming in, uh, growing up in a military family. That was one of the things, one of the answers that I would give to my dad is he would ask a question, and if he asked a question along the lines of why did you fail? Or why did you come short? The answer was no excuse. But that's not exactly the way that we're going to be talking about it tonight. Paul is teaching throughout the letters of the Romans, he's teaching this great theme that shows up this idea of being justified by faith. And he begins this letter to the Romans by telling them that he wants to share with them something that he would call a spiritual gift. And so my hope tonight is that we will get to do the same thing, I hope that I will be able to share a spiritual gift with you. And I hope that you will be able to share a spiritual gift with me. And I think we mean that in the same way that he would mean it, he started off the letter by saying that I would like to impart to you some spiritual gift to strengthen you. And immediately when we hear that we probably think of things along the lines of First Corinthians 12, speaking in tongues of raising people from the dead, and those types of things. The interesting thing about Paul, or the annoying thing, depending on how you think about it, is that he often tells you exactly what he means. And if you keep reading in the text, we're going to see that he's going to define exactly what he means. But as you get into this part, when you look in verse 11, if anybody ever asks you that would be like a Bible trivia question. Where is the only place where the phrase spiritual gift actually appears in the New Testament text? Is not First Corinthians 12. It's Romans chapter one. This is the only place in all the Bible where the phrase spiritual gifts shows up. And now you're gonna flip over to First Corinthians 12. Now that it's like you're 12 times, right? Actually, it's not the word that's there. It's just the word charisma. Or sometimes it's the word nematic costs. So you have spiritual people, or you have graces or gifts, but never spiritual and gift together, except Romans chapter one. And so what is the spiritual gift in Romans chapter one, I don't think Paul is saying, I want to come to Rome. So you guys can speak in tongues, or I want to come to Rome. So you guys can raise each other from the dead. I don't think he means any of that. I think he means exactly what he says in verse 12. He's gonna say that is. So Paul will do this a lot. He'll say something. And then right after that, he'll say that is or what I mean is, and so in case it was confusing, he's about to tell you what the spiritual gift is. And that is that we may be mutually encouraged by each other's faith, both yours and mine. So in other words, the spiritual gift isn't something that we might call a miraculous sign or a manifestation of the Spirit, the spiritual gift here in Romans, chapter one is just a gift. That is spiritual in nature. He's giving them something that is going to benefit them spiritually. And it's cool that he starts this letter off this way. He's never met these people, he doesn't know them. And so he's writing to them because of their faith. He has heard of their faith has been proclaimed throughout the world, and he wants to write to them and encourage that faith. I think he would do the same thing with us today. He would want to encourage our faith, he would want to give us a spiritual gift. And so that's why we're going to be looking in the letter of Romans were what is this spiritual gift. So Paul sits down and he starts writing this letter to the Romans. And apparently the issue or one of the struggles that they're having in Rome, is something that will be happening throughout the Christianity in the first century. And the second century, the third and the fourth, and the fifth, and we're going

Unknown Speaker  04:29
to keep going until we get to 21. So I'll just spare you that all the way up even to today. And it's this this struggle with justification by faith. This idea, this big concept is pretty much what the letter to the Romans is about. He's writing to them, explaining to them that they are justified that they have been justified by faith and they weren't justified by the works of the law. In other words, it's their faith in Christ that brings them all of the blessings all the spiritual blessings that are in the heavenly place. He says that we see in Ephesians chapter one, not, not what they do. And we struggle with that. Because the clearly there are things that we're supposed to be doing. But it's not the doing of them that brings about justification, or even blessings from God. And so when we start looking at this, what justification by faith is going to mean, in the very first two chapters of the Bible, there are some things that are in Romans chapter one, and two, he's going to tell us that there's no excuse for sin. In your life, if you were living as a faithful person, a faithful disciple of Jesus Christ, if you have been justified by faith, then there is no excuse for sin in your life. If you are living as a faithful disciple of Jesus Christ, there's also no excuse for you to pass judgment on other people. And those are the two things that we're going to spend the bulk of our time talking about tonight, these things were Paul will say, there's no excuse. There is no excuse for sin, there is no excuse for passing judgment. And these are things that I think he would probably need to say to people today. And the reason why I think he would need to say them to people is because I know that he would need to say them to me, he would need to take me aside, he would need need to say, Steven, you've been saved by the blood of Jesus Christ, he has cleansed you from all sin. You have been raised with him to walk in newness of life. What in the world is your problem? Why do you keep living like you did before? Why do you keep thinking the way that you did before. And on top of that, you go around judging everybody, you're, you're telling them where they're going? Yeah, that's not your job, man. He would tell me this. And he's gonna do that just in the first two chapters of the letter, the letter to the Romans. And throughout the rest of the letter, he's going to talk about some of the things that this will lead to that we can see very briefly, in the first two chapters, I think, and that this idea of being justified by faith leads us to not only the grace of God, but to in turn being gracious to other people. Instead of being judgmental, instead of being hard hearted, instead of being very aggressive towards others, it should lead us to being gracious to them. And it will lead us I think, this is the key understanding this idea, being justified through faith leads us to love not only to the love that God has for us, but into a genuine love for God, and a genuine love for other people, even our enemies. And so what I have found in my life is that when I don't get this, right, when I'm thinking incorrectly about this theme that the whole letter of the show the Romans is about, those are the times where I'm not loving to others. Those are the times where I'm not gracious to others. Those are the times where I falter in my own love for God. Those are the times when I falter in my love for other people when I forget this. And I forget that because I start making excuses for my sin. And I start making excuses for passing judgment. Well, it's okay for me to do this, because, and that's he's going to tell us that we don't get to do that. And so when we start looking at the text, this idea of justification by faith is actually brought up very early on in the Bible, it shows up in Genesis chapter three, God will tell Adam and Eve to do one thing, right, who will forbid them from doing one thing, don't eat the fruit of the tree of knowledge, good and evil. In Genesis, chapter three, he comes to Adam and he says, you listen to the voice of your wife. You listen to her voice instead of my voice. You didn't listen, you didn't obey. You weren't faithful. In Genesis, chapter 12, he's going to select this man, Abraham, he's going to promise him some things and then he's going to tell Abraham, you need to leave your kindred leave your family and go to the place that I'm going to show you. And right after God says that. It says an Abraham got up and left and he took with him his wife, Sarah and his nephew,

Unknown Speaker  08:56
Lot. He did nobody. He didn't listen to God's voice. And all throughout the story of the Old Testament, all of the accounts that you're going to see, they'll they'll go back to that same thing. It's going to be a reoccurring thing where people just don't listen to God's voice. They don't listen to what he said. While in Genesis, chapter 15, Abraham is struggling with what God has told him. And it will say in Genesis, chapter 15, verse six, and this is one of the key verses in the Bible if you had to name some of the key verses, that he believed the Lord and it was counted to him his righteousness. This is justification by faith. God promised Abraham something. And when Abraham believed, and it's more than just Okay, I agree to that mentally. It's this idea that alright god, you're setting the direction. And everything from this point forward is going to be based on the direction that you have set. Even the places where Abraham fails, right right after Genesis chapter 15. You have that story with with Hagar and Sarah, where now they're going to try and get the child at the For a way, I think that's because of Abraham's faith and says faith, actually, there's some misunderstandings there. But they're trying to get to the promise all over and over and over. But here's the idea, what God said, drives our actions. What God has promised, determines what we do. This is what it means to trust in God. And this is what it means to be justified by faith to the point we're over in Romans, chapter four, Paul is going to say it depends on faith. And it depends on faith in order that the promise may rest on Grace, and be guaranteed. You ever wonder if you're saved or not? Do you ever have that conversation with yourself that feeling like Oh, I was saved yesterday, but I did something really bad last night, I'm not saying today.

Unknown Speaker  10:47
Or maybe it was five minutes ago. And you kind of have this seesaw relationship between you and God, where you feel like you're in and then you're out, and then you're in and then you're out. We tend to do that when we forget that we are justified through faith, not through works. And when we start determining our status with God, based on what we do, if you do that you fail already. And so this idea, the fact that it depends on faith, that is what brings us to God's grace. And that is what guarantees this to everybody who shares the faith of Abraham. And this isn't something that you've decided, because it makes you happy. This isn't something that that is nice. It's not something that you do every once in a while. This is a life altering pivot type decision, you were headed in one direction, and now you're stopping and you're going in a completely different direction. That's Abraham's faith. Abraham was happy living where he was. And when God called him, he got up and left. Abraham was looking for an air from a different place. And when God said, No, that's not how we're going to do it. Abraham stopped looking in a different place. He changes his life based on what God says. And that's what we're called to do. Now, the thing about this is when we start talking about justification by faith, history bears out that it's very easy to get this wrong. And not just a little wrong, I mean, like a lot wrong. And the Bible bears out that this is very easy to get wrong. It's why the letter to the Romans is written, they were struggling with understanding this idea of being justified by faith. And so you can see in other places where the apostle Paul is gonna be dealing with the same issue. And over in Galatians, chapter one, he's going to warn them that when people preach a gospel, contrary to the one that he preached to them, that there occurs to their anathema they're cut off, they're completely without God. He'll say over in Galatians, chapter five, that they're severed from Christ, they have fallen from grace. Well, that's your bring up the question, what exactly is he talking about? Because if we're talking about being severed from Christ losing that relationship, what what does he mean this contrary gospel? And he's gonna tell us, right, Paul, he does that he says something and then later, he explains what it means. There are people who are going around and teaching that you're justified by your works by specifically by the works of the law, and then Galatians and happens to particularly be circumcision. And he's gonna say, No, that's not how it works. We believed in Christ Jesus, and that is how we are justified, it's by our faith in Christ Jesus, it's not by the works of the law, because through the works of the law, no one will be justified. And so this is the gospel that's being changed. It's not that they've gotten some minor detail wrong. It's not that they've left something out or that they've forgotten. So they are totally changing how you approach God. It's not through Christ. It's not through God's promises. It's through their own effort, and through their own works in their own flesh. And God says, No, that's not what we're doing. And so a very eye opening example, just to kind of throw something out there from my own life. That illustrates to me how how easy it is to get this wrong. And how quickly we can get off base from this idea of justification through faith is Romans chapter one and verse 16. When you look in Romans, chapter one, this is one of the, again a foundational texts in the scriptures. I'm not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes to the Jew first and also to the Greek. Well, the question is, when you get to this phrase, the gospel and then it says, four, it is the power of God. What does he mean? Does it mean? Does it mean this in a definitive way? Or does it mean this in a descriptive way? And what I mean is, does he mean that there are certain facts that you believe and when you believe those facts, those facts are the power that saves you? Or is he telling you the substance of the gospel? If he is telling you that the gospel the facts that you must learn the information about Jesus, if he is saying that is the power to salvation, then you better get all the facts right? You better get every single fact, right? You better not get all the facts, right? But you better do all the facts, right? You better believe them, and you better do them and you better not just do them and get them right once, but you better believe them and do them and get them right all the time. If he's telling you that the facts are what savior, that would be the definitive

Unknown Speaker  15:22
thing. Now, if he's describing what the gospel is, he's kind of telling us, Hey, this is what the gospel is, and try and read it this way. I'm not ashamed of the gospel, because it is God's power to save us. Or it is God's power that brings about our salvation. And when you hear it like that, think of passages like Isaiah chapter 63 And verse one, where we're told that it is God who is mighty to save, who is this who comes close and find garments enclosed in crimson? It is I, the one who is mighty to deliver. That's God. Or think about maybe First Peter chapter one and verse five. This is one of my favorite passages in the scriptures, where he's going to say that it is God's power that guards us through faith for salvation ready to be revealed in the last time. What Paul says in Romans chapter one is not that there is a set of facts that save you so get all these facts, right. That's not what he's saying. He's saying that the good news, the gospel, the good news is that God is both powerful to save you, and that God is willing to save you. And the reason why that distinction is important. And the reason why this is my example, is because one of those things focuses entirely on me. If it's the fact that save, then I have to get all the facts, right. I have to learn all the information. And I have to do all these things. And I have to continue doing all those things. But if this is telling us that God is mighty to save, and he's willing to save you, and that's the good news, then all of a sudden, I'm completely removed from the situation. And it focuses entirely on God, and who God is and what God has promised, and what God is willing to do. And those are the distinctions between being saved by works, and being justified by faith. One trusts in what God has promised and what God is doing and the other trusts on what I am doing. And that leads to problems leads to a whole host of issues. One of them being that we begin to make excuses for our sins. Because if your salvation depends on you knowing and understanding and getting everything right, then you can't have sin. So you're going to make excuses for the times that you fail, you're going to make excuses for the things that you don't get right all the time. And you're going to begin omitting yourself from passages that talk about places where we could improve. And you're going to begin judging people who don't get everything exactly the way that you think they should they don't get it right, you're gonna start judging people who disagree with you, you have to it's a self preservation technique, because they have one conclusion and you have a different conclusion. And it's the facts that save us, well, then they've got to be wrong, and they've got to be going to hell, and they have to be wicked and dishonest and horrible, because otherwise, then I am. But if you look at it differently, and if you see God is the center, and God is the power that saves and God is the deliverer, and God is the one who has made all these promises. Then you have the freedom to look at your life. And honestly say, I'm sitting here, and I need to stop. Not because I'm lost right now. But because this dishonor is the God who has saved me. This dishonor is my father who has adopted me into His family is dishonored the Christ who shed his blood on the cross to save me. This dishonor is my brothers and sisters who are striving to live holy lives in the Lord. You might wind up doing some of the exact same things, but the reason that you do them is different. And that's important. The reason that we do things is important. And so what he's gonna tell us is that there is no excuse for sin. And he's gonna say it in an interesting way. When you started going through Romans chapter one, and you look in verse 18, he's gonna say the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men, right? There's there's sin is not okay. And when you talk about justification through faith, people want to argue against that because they're saying well then that allows you to sin. In Romans chapter six, Paul will deal with that and he'll say the phrase Meccanoid toe May it never be. It is the strongest negative phrase that exists in the Greek language. Not only May it never be, but may never have started.

Unknown Speaker  19:56
That's kind of the idea. It is the most negative thing you You could think of saying, Never, absolutely not. Some translations say God forbid. So it doesn't give us a license to sin, it gives us the freedom to remove sin. Right? So there's the sun righteousness by this unrighteousness suppress the truth and so that what can be known about God is plain to them, because God has shown it to them for his invisible attributes, namely, his eternal power and divine nature. They've been clearly perceived ever since the creation of the world and the things that have been made. So there without excuse. And at that point, we know that's right. Those wicked unbelievers, those horrible centers, there without excuse, they should get all this right, right, they should be able to see that there is a God they should be able to see that there is a Creator and that he has bought them by sending His Son to die on the cross, and that he is willing to reconcile himself to them, and he is willing to wash all their sins away through the blood of Jesus, he's willing to do all that this is plain they should see it, what's their problem? And really, what he's arguing throughout there is he's arguing against a whole slew of things. He's gonna say that God gives people up three different times in this passage in Romans chapter one. although they knew God that didn't honor Him or give him a thanks, but they became futile in their thinking and their foolish hearts are darkened, and claiming to be wise, they became fools, and they exchange the glory of the immortal god for images resembling mortal man and birds and animals and creeping things, therefore, God gave them up. That's right, the wicked unbelievers. Verse 26. For this reason, God gave them up to dishonorable passions, it's all the sinners. Verse 28, and since they did not see fit to acknowledge God, God gave them up to a debased mind to do what ought not to be done.

Unknown Speaker  21:52
justification by faith levels, the playing field, and it takes away my excuse to sin. Mankind is really good at making excuses. Genesis, chapter three, God will come to the man and the

Unknown Speaker  22:09
woman will say why. Why are you hiding? We were hiding because we were naked. Who told you that you were naked? And God will say, did you eat from the tree? I

Unknown Speaker  22:23
told you not to eat? Animals say, Yeah, I did. But that woman that you gave me, she gave me the fruit and ate. It's her fault. And the woman will say we That's true. But the serpent tricked me. It's his fault. And there's these excuses for sin. God doesn't answer their objections, God just moves down through the line. And then God begins leveling curses at people, because death entered the world through sin. And all of this, all of this brings about all the problems that we are in today. And Paul is going to reach back to Genesis later in the book over in chapter five. And he's going to talk about Adam and the situation there with sin some more. But the idea here is that God is removing the excuse for sin. God has made himself perfectly plain. And the reason why we sin is because God doesn't force us to do right. He allows you to choose, he will give you up, he will hand you over, he will let you go and do whatever you want to do. And so every time we find ourselves sinning, we can't say, well, it's not really my fault, because it's totally my fault. Before I became a Christian, I believed something. I don't want to get into all the distinctions between original sin and bondage of the world and total, the proud I want to get into that stuff. But I believed something that gave me an excuse for my sin. I send because I couldn't help but God had made me in such a way that I was falling, I was depraved and my flesh was weakened to her I had no choice but to sin. And as long as I was in this weakened body, then I couldn't be held accountable for the sins that I was committing because of my weekends nature. That's not what the text says. The text throughout the Bible is that God comes to mankind and says, Hey, please do this.

Unknown Speaker  24:14
And mankind says, I'm hearing you. I'm gonna go ahead and go do my own thing. He saw the fruit. And then she reached out to take the fruit. And then she chose to eat.

Unknown Speaker  24:29
Adam saw his wife holding the fruit. He chose to reach out and take the fruit, and then he chose to eat. That See, take sin is a theme that appears throughout the Old Testament text. And Genesis chapter 16. With Sarah and Hagar. They see Hagar they take Hagar, they sin. Every time we fail in our life, there's not an excuse for it. You saw sin, you took sin and you ate it. You brought it into you. You became in a sense, sin. You made yourself sin. There's no excuse for it. And when we read through this passage and we start looking at all the things that these unbelievers do, and you read through this stuff, it's going to say they're going to have all manner of unrighteousness evil consciousness, malice. They're full of envy, murder, strife to see maliciousness. They're gossip, slanders haters of God, insolent, haughty, boastful, and vinters of evil, disobedient to parents, foolish, faithless, heartless, ruthless. And that's right about the time we like to look at everybody else. And not think about all the times that I've been malicious that I've been heartless that I've been faithless. He says in verse 32, though, they know God's righteous decree that those who practice such things deserve to die, they, they not only do them, but they give approval to those who practice them. And that's when we talk about the media, or the elites, or people in Hollywood and how they praise sin and thy Lord sin. And it took me a really long time to kind of get down to the fact that God isn't really addressing unbelievers in the letter to the

Unknown Speaker  26:25
Romans is he? It's written to Christians. It's written to people just like me, living about 2000 years ago. And he's telling them what they have done. It's not what people have done throughout time, we've all done this. And there is no distinction. There is no excuse.

Unknown Speaker  26:55
The Hebrews would have been making excuses likely when I read through this section, I often think of the Hebrews sitting there hearing this read for the very first time going, Yes, that was the deaths of Gentiles. Those dirty pygidium Gentiles, that's them. Those centers those people without God without the law, that's totally them. And then I started thinking about places like Jeremiah chapter seven. where God's speaking to Israel says, Do not trust in these deceptive words, the temple of the Lord, the temple of the Lord, the temple of the Lord. In other words, don't trust that you are somehow special or that you are somehow set apart and that your sins somehow don't matter. In the same way that the rest of the world sins do because God has given you some covenant, or some promises or that God has chosen to dwell among you don't think that that rules you out from the ravages of sand, don't think that that dismisses you from needing to live a holy and pure life righteous and all conduct. In fact, Jeremiah, chapter seven, the prophet will say, unless you live a holy life, I'm going to leave. And the exact same thing that happened to the Canaanites that you think you are so much better than it's gonna happen to you. And so when I read through Romans, chapter one, the thing that I'm being told is that all of these sins are mine. These are the things that I do. I may not do them in exactly the same way. But I still do these things. When we when we go through and we look at the history of Israel. You can see in Deuteronomy, chapter 29, where Moses is going to say there's going to be somebody here among you, has Deuteronomy, chapter nine verses 18 and 20. So there's somebody here among you who's gonna say to themselves, well, I don't really have to believe all this. I can just kind of go through the motions. And as long as I'm doing all the outward stuff the right way. It doesn't really matter what I think. It doesn't really matter that I haven't given my heart to God. It doesn't really matter that I don't love the Lord with all my heart with all my soul with all my strength. Nobody can tell if I'm doing that. So I'll just go along. I'll go to the festivals. I'll offer the sacrifices, but I'm really in my heart. I really want to worship bow. I really want to worship Mola. I really want to worship Dagon. But since that's against the law, I'll pretend to worship God and I'll keep all these idols in my heart. You're only 29 It says that you will be swept away bad things. Matthew chapter 23. This is precisely what the Pharisees were doing except I think the Pharisees are more like me than those ancient Israelites were perhaps in Matthew 23. Jesus is gonna say to the Pharisees, you're like whitewashed tombs outside, you appear to be beautiful, but on the inside, you're full of dead men's bones. Your works looked great, but who you are, that's the issue. Because you make excuses for your sins. You want to keep all your money so you develop traditions, this idea of Corbin where you can dedicate your things that the temple and then you get to keep them on, you don't have to help the people who are less fortunate than you in particular, your parents. I think you take that Pharisee. And you go back over here and you read through some of the things that are said they're haughty, boastful, inventors of evil, disobedient to parents foolish baseline. That pretty much just describes everybody. And I can fight against it. And I can disagree. And I can come up with reasons why my sins are different, and come up with reasons why they're excuses for what I've done.

Unknown Speaker  30:38
Or I can just agree, there is no excuse for this. And I have to get all of these things out of my life.

Unknown Speaker  30:45
And I have to stop sinning. I have to stop coming up with ways to get around what God has said, I have to stop being foolish in my heart, I have to take the words of God into my heart and allow them to change who I am. I have to allow God to direct my steps, I have to allow God to show me who I must be and what I must be

Unknown Speaker  31:10
doing. And then because I believe it, do it. I think Paul would spend a lot of time talking to me

Unknown Speaker  31:18
about that. The next thing is directly related to it. Because what we tend to do is when we're justifying our own sins, we tend to magnify the sins of others. But this idea of justification by faith, it says that we should be seeking obedience because of love, that we should be striving to live a maximum ly faithful, a maximum, a maximum amount of faithfulness in our life, that we should be staying away from sin not getting as close to sin as we possibly can, that we should be getting rid of half hearted devotion, and throwing ourselves completely into the work that God has planned for us from the foundation of the earth. Another way that I like to discuss this with my kids is when we think about who we are as a Christian, do you define your life in Christ as what you don't do? Or do you find your do you define your life as a Christian by what you actually do? If somebody were to say, what is it that makes you a Christian? Would you say, Well, I don't gamble. I don't rob banks. I don't murder people. And I don't generally walk up to people and punch them in the face the first time I meet them. So that's me being a Christian. You've pretty much described every atheists life to. So you've been thinking about what it means to be a Christian, it's not what you don't do. It's what you do. Do you go and help the poor? Do you go and encourage people share that spiritual gift with them to build up their faith? Do you go and find good works that you can do here amongst your brothers and sisters, out in the community out wherever you happen to be? What are you actually doing, to become, or to be a faithful follower of Jesus. And when we begin worrying about what we're doing, then all of a sudden, this next part doesn't become much of an issue. But this idea of owning sin, yeah, I'm a sinner. These things are awful. There's no excuse for them, they need to get out of my life, and I need to start doing the right thing. That will pretty much take care of the second part, which is don't judge. God has removed all all excuse for judgment. And we see that in chapter two and verse one, therefore, you have no excuse, oh, man, every one of you who judges for in passing judgment on another you condemn yourself because you, the judge, practice the very same thing. We know that the judgment of God rightly falls on those who practice such things into us impose on man, you who judge those who practice such things and yet do them yourself, that you will escape the judgment of God or do you presume on the riches of His kindness and forbearance and patience, not knowing that God's kindness is meant to lead you to repentance? But because of your heart and the penitent heart, you're storing up wrath for yourself on the day of wrath when God's righteous judgment will be revealed? And so basically kind of what he's just said, as you're so concerned with all the wrongs that everybody else is doing this, you're not doing the good you should be doing and you're committing the exact same sins. Though it might look a little different. And took me a long time to realize that that just because we sin in a different way, it doesn't mean we're not committing the exact same sin. You may talk about how are smart you are. But if I walked around showing you my muscles, they're pretty impressive. If I walked around showing you my muscles, we both struggle with pride. We're both sinning, we're just doing it different ways. If you control your temper at work, and you never exploded anybody, but then when you get home, you let your family habit. And then I'm the one who loses my temper at work, and I yell and scream at everybody, when I come home, I'm a peaceful person. We both struggle with anger, we just do it differently. And so all of a sudden, now I'm beginning to see a reading through this looking at myself that this whole idea of passing judgment, I don't get to do that. I'm not the judge. This doesn't mean when we start talking about this, it doesn't mean that we don't ever talk about sin. But what it means is what Jesus said over in Matthew chapter seven in verse one, which, incidentally, is the most famous verse in the Bible, you've probably had atheists quote this to you. You know, I used to think John 316, was the most popular verse. It's not. It's Matthew, chapter seven, verse one. Don't judge. So that's all people, quote. Don't judge so that you won't be judged. For the judgment you pronounce, you will be judged and with a measure you use, it will be measured to you. Why do you see the speck in your brother's eye but you don't notice the log that is in your own eye? Or how can you say to your brother, let me take the speck out of your eye on when there's a log in your own you hypocrite, first take the log out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to take the speck out of your brother's eye, Mike, my children think that passage is hilarious. We got a board one time and had him walk around holding the board in their face, and they were trying to it was funny. Jesus is a pretty funny guy.

Unknown Speaker  36:48
But his point is pretty serious. Don't judge or you will be judged. You're not fit to judge. I'm not fit to judge. And so when we get over to Romans, chapter two, Paul just laid all this stuff out. We're ready. So yeah, other people. And Paul says no, no, no, you. Me too. He would probably say about himself. I think he does that around chapter seven and chapter eight in Romans. And so there's this idea that we have to stop condemning others, it's not our job. Again, it doesn't mean that we don't try and talk about what's right. It doesn't mean that we have discussions, it doesn't mean that we don't teach people we speak the truth in love. You can see that in Ephesians chapter four, but our speech when it comes out, it's not just speak the truth and love. Right, people will quote that right after they say something horribly mean to you. In Ephesians, chapter four, verse 29, says no, let no corrupting speech come out of your mouth, but only that which is good for building up as the occasion as fits the occasion. I quote that to my kids a lot. Just because somebody has done something wrong, it doesn't give you the right to tear them down and destroy them with your tongue. That is an opportunity to help instruct them and build them up. That's evasions for 29. That corrupting talk is rust or decay, something that slowly wears things down over time. But that's not our job. Our job is to be builders, not tearing down the building up when somebody makes a mistake. Here's your opportunity. Let's get that mistake out of the way. Let's build something amazing here in its place. When somebody realizes there's a sin in their life, we can take the Bible and beat them over the head with it. Or we can say, Yeah, you're right, that wasn't good. Now, let's get that out of the way. And let's put something awesome in its place. Let's get sin out and let's put Christ in. Let's get the world out. And let's put God in. And let's become more like God every day in every way, in everything we say. Let's just become like Jesus has become more like the one who has bought us. When I first became a Christian, I was really good at passing judgment. And then there was an older man who had been preaching, I don't know 50 For 1000 years. And I got to sit in a class that he was teaching. And it was about the letters that genre first, second, third, John, and we wound off somewhere in James. And in James chapter four, we went through verse 11, and 12, it says, Do not speak evil against one another brothers and the one who speaks against a brother or judges, his brother speaks evil against the law, and judges the law. But if you judge the law, you're not a doer of the law, but a judge. There's only one law giver and judge, he who is able to save and destroy but who are you to judge your neighbor? And then I was reading through Romans and that man's words and that passage came to mind. And the way that he explains that I haven't really found a better way to explain it. Was that when you take the seat of the judge, you have pushed God

Unknown Speaker  39:53
out of his place. You are taking Jesus's spot on the judgment seat. You have removed God from the equation and put yourself on his altar,

Unknown Speaker  40:08
which is really powerful picture because that's what you do with an idol, right? You build an altar and you stick the idol on it. And then when you read through Romans chapter one, and it talks in verse 25. And it says that these people that he's been talking about God gives them up to the loss of their heart, the impurity of dishonouring, the bodies amongst themselves, and verse 25, because they exchange the truth about God for a lie, and they worshipped and served the creature, rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever, amen. That's what we do. When we judge, we push God out of the way, and we take his seat. And we worship ourselves. Instead of the Creator. We become idolaters, we make ourselves to be God. And I read the Bible a few times. And that's just never a good idea. And so we should leave the judgment to God to whom it belongs, we should leave Christ to sit on the judgment seat. And we should be content to build people up and help them and show them what they need to fix, and show them how to fix it and show and fix it with them. And invite them into our lives and help them fix ourselves and help help everybody build things up. So that the whole body is becoming what it wants to be or needs to be. So that the fullness of the stature grows into the mature manhood of Jesus, and we become more like Christ each and every day. When we get judgment out of the way, and allows us to deal realistically with each other. It allows us the freedom to love each other. And it allows us to accept correction from one another, and it will give us loving hearts. And we're going to go through some things very quickly some of the applications from this is that when we realize that all of this is true, and that there's there's no excuse for our sin, we can't fix it by ourselves, it's not excused. And that we need, we need God to save us, and that judging other people doesn't make us right. That's going to cause us to come back to God who alone can deliver us, it will cause us instead of passing judgment on other people, instead of trying to push people out of God's family, it will cause us to seek ways to bring them in, we'll go get the lost sheep and bring them back to the flock, we'll go find somebody who's never known the Lord and bring them to Jesus, we want to have fellowship with other people, it will cause us to seek reconciliation. If somebody has harmed us, we will no longer be content to just shove them out and say, well, they've got a problem with God. No, that's not what this does. That's not what faith does. That's not what love does. Imagine if Christ came to earth, and he saw the senators and he was just content to let them have a problem with God. He sought our reconciliation, actively went to go find us and bring us back to the Father will give us a heart that seeks peace will become the sons of God, like Jesus talks about in the Sermon on the Mount, no longer having to judge or worry about finding fault with others. But we all want reconciliation. And we want a peaceful life together all is God's children, to build one another up to build the body up to seek for unity with one another. And for those around us trying to bring everybody in to Christ. One of the things that I need to do more is help. It's easy to look around and see problems. They're easy to identify. It's hard to make it personal. And go do something about it. It's hard to see somebody struggling, and not just go home and say well, I'll pray for them. It's hard to see somebody in need and not just go home and pray for them. The whole passage and James be warmed and filled and they do nothing. But this idea of having no excuses for sin. If there's no excuse for it, then I can't leave it. I can't be content to have it in my life. And it's not because I'm worried that one sin is gonna condemn me it's not because I'm worried that I'm not living up to the standard. It's because I'm faithful to God and I want to love Him and be like him. And what this does is it causes us to love like Christ, it will drive us out and will become more like Jesus. And it's pretty interesting when you start looking at the ways that Christ talks about his disciples. He's gonna say that it's the love that we have with one another. By this all people will know that you're my disciples if you have love for one another. I remember reading that for the first time to waver, oh, it's not my doctrinal purity. That will set me apart as a believer that people are going to come and see the statement of faith that I've written and go wow, you must be a Christian. It's not it's not my my personal holiness. People aren't going to see me living a good life and say, Wow, you don't ever do anything wrong. You must be Question.

Unknown Speaker  45:04
I don't think that gives us an excuse to not do those things. I don't think Jesus is saying none of that other stuff matters. That's not what he means. What he's saying is the difference between his people. And the rest of the world is that we will love one another. And that we will draw close to one another. And there's no excuse not to do this. We've been set free, this idea of justification by faith and this idea of no excuse for sins, this idea of no excuse for judging other people, rather than shutting things up and making it easy to kind of, you know, shut the world out from yourself and be content just to make sure that you don't do anything wrong. And and excuse yourself, when it does, it forces you to get out and it sets you free to go do good. It sets you free to go love, it sets you free to go help. It sets you free from worrying about finding everything wrong with everybody else. And it sets you free to go be a helper to be somebody who loves to serve somebody who shows compassion, it sets you free to go out and try to live a faithful life. If you're like me, sometimes you don't go out and do work. Because you're afraid you're gonna make a mistake. You don't go share the gospel because you're afraid you might say something wrong. You don't go help somebody because you're afraid you might not do it the right way. Another danger here with this idea of justification by faith is that some people will take and say, well, there's no rules, it doesn't matter. That's not true. You will try and share the gospel exactly the way God what we want you to have it, you're not going to add anything to it, you're not gonna take anything away from it. But this idea of justification by faith sets you free to go share the Gospel. And if you make a mistake, you come back to the Lord and say, I messed up shouldn't have done that. Please forgive me. This idea of justification by faith where there's no excuses for your sin, and there's no excuse for passing judgment, it sets you free to go and help somebody. And if you make a mistake, you ask for forgiveness. It sets you free to go do Christianity. Instead of saying Shut up and donating Christianity. There is no donating in the Bible there is doing. And I think that's what Paul is talking about in those first two chapters where he takes away our excuse to sin. A takes away our excuse to pass judgment, laying us bare with nothing. You've got no salvation without Christ. And you've got no method of comparison to make yourself look better. The only thing you can do is come to the Lord and beg is forgiveness. And the way that you do that, according to what Peter says over in First Peter chapter three is by being baptized into Christ. He would talk about the Ark and Noah and how he saved through the water, he would say baptism is like this. Now the washing away of the filth of the flesh, but an appeal to God for a good conscience. So that's how you ask God to forgive you. And men and women throughout history men and women in the scriptures in the first century, when they would hear the Gospel of Jesus, they would ask questions like What must we do to be saved? The apostle Paul would answer over and Acts chapter 16, he would he would tell a man of Philippian jailer about Jesus. I think we talked to him about baptism to the point where the Philippian jailer in the middle of the night will be baptized, he and his whole household and there was much celebrating and on the Day of Pentecost, Peter speaking in that chapter to answer that question, What must we do? Repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. This promises for you and your children and all who are far off everyone in the Lord our God will call himself the answer is the same today. When you realize that there's no excuse for the sin in your life and, and there's no way to pass the buck off. There's no way to to compare yourself to other people and make you look better so that God will condemn them and not you. The answer for us are the same. What must I do? You must be baptized into Christ, for the forgiveness of your sins. And you will be adopted by God into his family will be brought in, your sins will be washed away and you will be set free to love. You're set free to grow. You'll be set free to develop your faith to learn what God would have you to do to really trust it. And to walk not by sight. But by faith. That's the invitation was first given 2000 years ago. It's still here today. If there's something that you need, if you've been struggling with this, your brothers and sisters are here, we'll pray for you. We will encourage you to build one another up. Thank you very much for being here has been greatly encouraging to me. It's been a gift to me. I hope that this has been helpful to you and if there's anything you need again, please come while we stand and while we sing our song of invitation Shut
