scripture reading. And for the opportunity of getting to be with each and every one of you. It just gives me an opportunity to say a special thank you for your love, or your fellowship. And for holding my hands up. We've had a relationship together for many years, you've supported me and going to the Philippines. And I don't know how many different trips, I've made 33 trips over there. 17, trips to Zimbabwe, 14 trips to South Africa, numerous trips to Vietnam, to China, Indonesia, Malaysia, and the list goes on and on Central America, South America throughout Europe. And your prayers means so much to me. And I appreciate your willingness of allowing me to stand in the pulpit tonight. I do solicit your prayers. And tonight, as we are part of this wonderful summer series that you put together, as we try to discuss from the book of John, I have chosen the theme here it is finished, taken from the 19 chapter. Now, when Jesus was on the cross, there were seven statements that he made. Now sometimes I have had the good fortune. See if I can find there you go. I've had the good fortune of being able to preach the gospel meeting, the seven lessons. Tonight, I only have the opportunity to do one. So if we take the seven statements and divide them, there were those statements that were made before the darkness. The first one when Jesus said, Father, forgive them, they don't know what they do. And then the second statement, talking to that thief beside him, today, you will be with Me in Paradise. And then with a third one. And to me this one is an emotional one. Can you imagine looking down from the cross at your mother, and then looking at one of your good friends, and to say, Woman, behold thy son, and intimacy that is there with his friend. And then to say to that friend, behold your mother. And so these statements all were before the darkness. And then the darkness comes in. And during the darkness, we see that he cries out a quote that we find in Psalms chapter 22. My God, My God, why hast thou forsaken me. And then we have the quotes after the darkness. And this is what he says, I thirst. And then the next one is when he says, the one that we're using tonight, I don't know why this keeps going back and forth, it is finished. And then the final one, when he says, Father, into my hands, I commend my spirit. Now, as I said at the beginning, I truly enjoy doing the whole series to be able to preach all seven of the statements. But tonight, I want us to focus on this one. It is finished. Because I believe that here is the heart of the gospel. Gee, Jesus knew why he left heaven. And from my little finite mind that's hard to comprehend. I read in a book one time for us to be in heaven and leave there to come to Earth would be like God asking us to live in the belly of an earthworm. But Jesus left that home with his father to come here below to live among pain and sickness and trials and death. But down here he is hanging on that cross. And He knows that he has completed all of the work that the Father had given him to do. Here's a quote that William Barclay had in his book. He says when we compare the four Gospels, we find the most illuminating thing.

Unknown Speaker  04:57
The other three Matthew Mark and Luke, do not tell us that Jesus made this statement, it is finished. That's only here in John. But they do tell us that he screamed, a loud scream from the cross. And you can see that in Matthew 27, Mark 15, Luke 23. Now on the other hand, John does not speak about the great cry. But John speaks of these words it is finished. And I am persuaded, as William Barclay is trying to argue in his book, that the great shout out and the words it is finished, are one and the same. It come from a Greek word. And Jesus died with a shout of triumph on his lips, he did not say it is finished in a weary defeat. He did not say it is finished to give up or to say, I have failed. He said it as one who shouts for joy. For one that feels that there has been a victory. He seemed to be broken on the cross. But he knew that his victory was one. So when we look at that Greek word, it means to bring to an end, to have completed something to fulfill something they are just defines it in his book, to bring to a close to Finish to end. It's like a servant, that has completed the task that the master has given. It's like a receipt, where that you owe so much. But now they take the rubber stamp, and they mark it paid in full. Well, I read these words from my savior on the cross, It is finished. Knowing that it is paid in full, I look at that as a completeness and victory. Now, there may be some of you here that might choose to run and various marathons. And you know, that excitement of seeing the finish line, that ribbon up there in front of you the exhaustion that you feel. But then they finally break through that ribbon to cross that finish line. And to say I have finished. That's what the words here are, is similar to the words the apostle Paul, as he was pinning his last book that he was ever going to write. And in his last chapter there, he said, I'm ready. I'm ready to be poured out that was language like from the old tests, but with the liquid offering.

Unknown Speaker  08:12
But to paraphrase it, I'm ready to die. I've lived a good life. It is finished. I have fought the good fight. I have finished the race. I have kept the faith. The sad thing is, there are many of you that could stop and think of somebody

Unknown Speaker  08:42
that you know that used to be faithful to the Lord. Maybe even someone that used to be a member of this congregation. Someone that used to be regular in attendance. But they've left the Lord. I believe the saddest words that I can read in the New Testament is that man named Dimas. When we look and to chat and to books in the Bible, the apostle Paul referred to Dimas as his fellow soldier, his fellow laborer, a fellow gospel preacher, and then later than we read where he says Deimos has forsaken me. The Dimas has gone back to the world. And as I said, many of you could think of someone that is made shipwreck of the Fae that has gone back into the world. But when someone dies with this confidence I have fought the good fight. I have finished the race have kept the faith knowing that many of you have been praying for me and my family and these recent weeks. Last Thursday night, my daughter drove down from Indiana and had the grandchildren. And when Dolores was still conscious, she was able to look at the grandchildren said Nanos bags are packed, and I'm getting ready to go. I wish that every child of God could have that kind of confidence to say, I'm going to finish the race. Now what had Jesus finished? Well, he had finished a life of perfection. We look at what the writer tells us and Hebrews chapter four, we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses. But one who in every respect has been tempted as we are, yet without saying, Now, if there was someone here tonight that had lost their house and the tornado and if I came up to you and say, I know how you feel. You would have the right to look at me and say, No, you don't. Only this week, if I try to counsel with someone and studied the Bible, and if they've lost their spouse, only now can I say, I know how you feel. In the past, I had been able to grieve with those who lost a child, I know how you feel. Someone that had lost a grandchild. I know how you feel. But you see, when we look at this, when you have your trials, and you have your tribulations and you have those bad days, and you have those days where the devil just won't leave you alone and it's a fight. Jesus can say, I know how you feel. We read Matthew chapter four, and the devil Haiti with those three temptations. I know that you're smart enough to already know this, but will you indulge me to say it anyway?

Unknown Speaker  12:37
There are only three ways that you can be tempted. The lust of the eyes, the lust of the flesh, and the pride of life. That is how the devil tempted Adam and Eve in the very beginning. That is how those three avenues was how the devil was trying to tempt Jesus and Matthew four.

Unknown Speaker  13:04
And that is how that in John's epistle he tells us that's how he will tempt us today. And Jesus can say, I know how you feel. In Hebrews chapter two and verse 10, for it was fitting that He for whom and by whom all things exist, and bringing many sons to glory should make the founder of their salvation perfect. Through suffering, chapter two verse 18, for because he himself has suffered when tempted, He is able to help those who are being tempted. So this life of perfection, to be tempted like we are tempted and yet to be the only one that is going to the end to say I never seen he had completed he had finished a life of perfection. But also the law of Moses has now finished Hebrews chapter eight verse seven, for if that first covenant had been faultless, there would have been no occasion to look for a second one. He takes away the first one so that he can establish the second one is sort of disheartening to try to study the Bible with somebody and they want to pick and choose like there's some kind of a smorgasbord err well, I'll take this first. I liked that one. But I want to go back in the Old Testament, I want to I want to pick up instrumental music the Old Testament can find that the New Testament Well, I wonder why they don't pick up while they're the Old Testament. Why don't they pick up Animal sacrifices. Why don't they pick up the dietary restrictions, I would not have made a good you, I'll tell you that. Because they couldn't eat cat fish, it couldn't eat pork chops. But I'm glad that that old all has been taken out of the way. That was one of the things that was finished. The same way. Then when we look at Colossians chapter two, he took it out of the way. He nailed it to the cross. Hebrews chapter seven, for when there's a change in the priesthood, there is necessarily a change in the law as well.

Unknown Speaker  15:43
If you are a Christian delight, you are a priest. Now the only way you're not of the tribe of Libra.

Unknown Speaker  15:55
So how could we have a different priesthood unless we change the law. And so when we look at all the possibilities, when Jesus uses that statement, it is finished. The Law of Moses was included in. And now let's talk about the scheme of redemption. It wasn't an accident. It was purposed. As Paul says in Ephesians, chapter three, this was according to the eternal purpose that He has realized in Christ Jesus our Lord. I feel sorry for people that belong to some church that teaches that false doctrine of premillennialism. They teach that Jesus came to the earth to establish the kingdom. But they killed him before he got it done. So just as a last minute thought, he said, I know what I'll do, I'll give you the church. And then they teach that Jesus is going to come back someday, he's going to go to Jerusalem, and he's gonna go through the city, dump the trash over there. And he's gonna find David's throne, and gonna clean it up. And then Jesus got to sit on that throne, and then He will establish the kingdom. Now, when we look at how that kingdom and church are used, and the New Testament,

Unknown Speaker  17:35
it wasn't an afterthought. It wasn't a substitute. Even before God made Adam and Eve, he already had it in his mind. Because this was the eternal purpose. That he knew what his plan was going to be. And he knew how that Jesus

Unknown Speaker  18:03
will offer for us a way of being redeemed. It was prophesied is Daniel chapter nine, verse 24, says, to finish the transgression, to put an end to sin, and to atone for iniquity, to bring in everlasting righteousness, to see you both vision and profit, and to anoint a most holy place. And one of the verses that I love, when John was standing there with two of his disciples, he looked off and then he pointed. Behold, the Lamb of God. For 39 books, in the Old Testament, the message had been, someone is coming, someone is coming, someone is coming. They could freely use the word about the Messiah, the king. And now John, the cousin of Jesus, has been out there in the wilderness preaching. And with John standing there with two of his disciples, he pointed to Jesus. This is the one that can take away the sins of the world. And so, Jesus willingly, willingly accepts there. I have confidence that this church sometimes sings the song in that book, he could have called 10,000 angels. He could have said at any moment stop at that Senator Bob Buchanan is not worth the blood of Jesus. Let him die. Let him go to hell. You see, Jesus loved me enough that he stayed on the cross. I have three grandchildren and the little grandson he and I used to play a game all the time. Is that Grandpa bought? How much do you love me acid otitis. I love you this much. I ain't enough. Alright, I love you this March. Still not enough. I love you that you can sort of see where this going. He wasn't content until my arms were stretched as far as I could stretch him. I love you this much. And then when his little had take off, run and jump, and then catch you in my arms. I have a sign that stayed in my office for many years who said I asked Jesus one day, how much do you love me.

Unknown Speaker  21:02
And he stretched out his arms to show me how much and that's when they nailed him to the courthouse. It was not the nails that kept him on that cross.

Unknown Speaker  21:16
He could have gotten off of that cross at any moment, he got a call the legion of angels. But for you and you, you all the way around this room and to me. His love kept him on that cross. But now on this cross, the work has been accomplished. This is the moment of his glory, not his enemies. The verbs are active, bowing his head. He gave up his spirit. As some Bible scholars suggest that there are more than 300 prophetic scriptures that are completed in the life of Jesus. Everything from where he was going to be born everything from his lineage, everything from the fact that his mother was a young virgin, everything from the method of his execution. These things were beyond his control. And when you look at 300 prophecies, these could not have been accidentally fulfilled. We're talking about the Son of God, with his own words recorded in the gospels. Jesus reveals that he had a priority and doing his father's work. He knew why he left half and he knew why he was here. And he said to them, My food is to do the will of Him who sent Me and to accomplish his work. John, chapter six, For I have come down from heaven not to do by own wheel. But the wheel of Him who sent Me. This is the will of Him who sent me that I should lose nothing of all that He has given me. But raise it up on the last day. And Jesus reveals that he had a purpose in his life and that he had a purpose in his death. What was his purpose?

Unknown Speaker  23:43
What's your purpose? Jesus wanted always to glorify God. Is that your purpose? Jesus wanted to teach his apostles how many people of Utah in the last year? How many people have you invited to this summer series?

Unknown Speaker  24:09
How many people have you tried to sign up for a Bible Correspondence Course? How many people have you offered to hand them a religious track and say, Please read that and then I'll get back with you next week and we can discuss it. There was a man many years ago from India that came to the United States. And he got him a job in the Smithsonian Institution as a janitor.

Unknown Speaker  24:37
Maybe some of you have met my friend Harry Prasad. While in there, sweeping and mopping, on the back of the commode was a religious tract. And he took it home and he read it. And there was a phone number on the back. It says if you read this, please give me Uncle

Unknown Speaker  25:02
Harry became a Christian. And Harry became a gospel preacher. Just because of that little religious tract. You might feel that you're not qualified to do much teaching. But do you think you could hand out a track? You think you could leave one on the counter at the post office? You think you could leave one with your tip on top of it

Unknown Speaker  25:34
for the waitress at the restaurant? Are you looking for someone to bring to the Lord. Jesus also had the purpose of sending teachers out into the world. Even if we have the truth, no one's going to be converted. If we keep it.

Unknown Speaker  26:07
It only takes two things to make a Christian. Listen to me carefully as I close. It takes two things to make a Christian the power of the gospel of Jesus Christ and an open heart. I cannot look at someone on the street to the sidewalk and determine what kind of a heart they have.

Unknown Speaker  26:37
We sometimes judge people by the outward appearance. Now do I approve of and modesty and that lady's short skirt? No, I don't. Do I prove that this one is a prostitute? No, I do not. Do I prove that this was a drug addict? No, I do not. Do I prove that this man has already busted up five marriages and fornication all over the county? No, I do.

Unknown Speaker  27:13
But every example that I just gave you describes people that have been part of my life. One lady that ran away from home, started using drugs became a prostitute. She was the madam and one of the largest houses of prostitution in New York.

Unknown Speaker  27:48
I'm happy to tell you not only is she a Christian today, but she's married to a gospel preacher.

Unknown Speaker  27:54
And is one of the finest Bible teachers that I know. A man up in Louisville, Kentucky, asked to be baptized. And as soon as he came up out of the water saying Hallelujah, my sins are gone.

Unknown Speaker  28:12
Now take me to the police and turn me I'm a fugitive murderer murdered a man. Listen to me, brothers and sisters. It doesn't matter how dirty they got. It doesn't matter how ugly we consider their sins. The reason that Jesus went to that cross is so that they would have a chance so that they could be saved. That they could denounce their fornication. They can denounce homosexuality, they could denounce their drugs. They could denounced that they were a thief. They could denounce the pornography. They could denounce their murderer.

Unknown Speaker  28:59
And they can start all over again. His purpose in life was to share God's glory with the believers. While on his way to Jerusalem. Jesus reveals to his disciples the reason for his predictions of death.

Unknown Speaker  29:24
He was to give His life a ransom for many. I had a big debt, but I could not pay. So Jesus paid it for me. The Greek word for ransom is defined as a means of loosing.

Unknown Speaker  29:48
So the essential character of his death was to pay the price for me to pay the price to free the lives of others.

Unknown Speaker  30:06
God hates sin. Sin separates us from God. But God is saying, I love you. And I want you to come back to me. I love to do word studies. And this word, religion is really an interesting that prefix re, just simply means again the section Leon that's where we also get our word, ligament. Now some of your that are in the medical profession, you could give us a speech, the ligaments bind together those muscles.

Unknown Speaker  31:08
Now let's put these two together. Again, legally on binding, binding together again. Bob, what are you? What do you mean? Again? Are you looking at how many precious precious precious children are in this building the light. They're innocent. They're pure. When I was asked to do the funeral for my little granddaughter that only live for 17 hours, I use the words of King David. I can't bring that child back. But I can go to the child. Those children die in innocence, impurity, those child's go to be with the Father. But you see, we reach an age, we reach an age that we make a choice to sin. We make a choice to do what God doesn't want us to do.

Unknown Speaker  32:22
And we separate ourselves from him. But now he offers a pure religion to be bound together again. We can come up out of that watery grave of baptism,

Unknown Speaker  32:42
regardless of how, how many sins that we've committed to know that by the power of the blood of Jesus, through God's grace, I had enough faith to try to submit that I could be baptized to touch that book. Romans chapter six, verses three and four says that I am baptized into Christ. And I've heard many Bible teachers and preachers emphasize that point was for some reason, some don't emphasize baptize into his death. I have to touch the blood. And we do that through faith, as we are buried in that watery grave. I go in as a sinner. I come out and Jesus has paid the ransom. He paid the price that I couldn't pay. But I can be saved and have the hope of heaven. Jesus gave His life satisfying the wrath of God. That's why he could say from the cross It is finished. Now in closing if I stood here the rest of the night and held my hand out right like this. Is that a handshake? Now what would it take to turn this into a handshake? You're going to have to reach up and take hold. I want you right now. To use your imagination and picture Jesus with his hands stuck out. And Jesus saying I know that you're a sinner. I know what you've done. I know that you feel that your life is just a bunch of broken pieces.

Unknown Speaker  35:08
But God is saying, I love you. Give me all the broken pieces. And let me put you back together again. You say he's got his hand extended, here's my love. Here's my forgiveness. Here's my grace. Here's my redemption. But you've got to grab hold. Now, in closing, let me say this. Any weak person can be a center doesn't take much to be a center. That didn't take much to go out here with a gang tonight, let's go to a bar and get drunk.

Unknown Speaker  35:56
Doesn't take much to meet some lady of the motel tonight, if you've got a few dollars, doesn't take much to try to steal something from the company where you're working. Any weak person can be a center. But it sure does take some power and some strength and some faith. To say I'm not going to do those things. I'm going to be different for your students, grade school, middle school, high school college.

Unknown Speaker  36:34
God is saying I want you to become my child. And I want you to be different. There will be temptations. Somebody might make fun of you. But God wants you to be strong. But I'm here to tell you that's going to take courage. That's going to say strength. So as I step out of this pulpit, let me ask you,

Unknown Speaker  37:07
you think you have what it takes? Do you have enough trust enough confidence in the creator of this world? That you say all right, God, I'm ready to obey. I put it off long enough. I've wrestled with my conscience. I have turned down that invitation week after week. But tonight, you say I'm finally strong enough. I'm finally brave enough. Now if you're nervous to walk down one of these three aisles if you just stick your foot out and get started, I'll run back and meet you and walk down

Unknown Speaker  37:50
with you. But you've got to have the courage to say I'm ready to repent. I'm ready to confess that I believe Jesus Christ is the Son of God.

Unknown Speaker  38:08
I'm ready to let one of these men tonight Lord me down into that water so that my faith, I can contact that blood of Jesus.

Unknown Speaker  38:18
I'm ready to be raised a new creature and to spend the rest of my life fighting the devil.

Unknown Speaker  38:29
In a weak person can be a center that is going to take a courageous man or woman to say I'm ready to be a disciple of Jesus.

Unknown Speaker  38:40
Do you have what it takes? If there's any way that we can help you tonight Let us know what together we stand to sing this

Unknown Speaker  38:48
song.
