Good morning, if you want to be opening up your Bibles to First Samuel chapter 17.

Conrad Harkrider  00:21
We had our we concluded our VBS, a couple of weeks ago, and we had a great series of lessons on the life of David. The kids classes talked about how he was a king, and a friend, a warrior, a psalmist, and a man after God's own heart, and in the adult class, Matt harbor led us through a great series of lessons from the book of First Samuel. And so I'd like to spend the rest of our time this morning, looking at one of the most well known accounts from the book in First Samuel, chapter 17. I want to start by asking you a question. Think about this for just a moment. Is it possible for one man to make a difference? This world is a big place, there are a lot of people alive today. Is it possible for one person amidst all of humanity, is it? Is it even possible for one person to have an impact? Some of you have met my father many of you have not. My father is a good man, not a perfect man, but he is a good man. When we were growing up, Dad was always the coach of our sports teams. And I remember when I was in sixth grade, he was coaching my little league baseball team, and we were competing for the championship, not the Williams sport championship, but they're in San Antonio, Texas, our little league. And that year, I was one of the pitchers on the team. And I had a very unusual offspeed pitch. Most kids didn't throw a knuckleball. And so dad would call the pitches from the dugout, anytime he wanted me to throw that pitch, he would give a signal. It's very subtle, he would take a pin and place it into his shirt pocket. And so before I stepped up onto the mound, I would look over at dad, and he would be touching his wrists and patting his head and rubbing across his chest. And none of that meant anything. The team would study his erratic behaviors trying to figure out what he was doing. But him and I were on the same page. I respect my dad, not only because he was a good coach, but what I've seen in his character. as I've grown older, he is dependable, hardworking, committed to his family. And now I have see looking back that he has made a difference. He's had an impact on the lives of his sons, his children, his family and his grandchildren. The story of David begins when Samuel comes to anoint Him as King. But really were introduced to the character of David in First Samuel, chapter 17. First Samuel 17, the setting is a great battle. And although David is just one man, we see that he can make a difference in the lives of the men around him, for the nation of Israel, and ultimately for God's people for all time. In First Samuel 17, the Philistines have come out in full force against Saul and his army. They've come out to a valley and there are two mountains on either side and Saul and his army are on one side and the Philistines are gathered on the other. And verse four of First Samuel 17 describes the Philistine champion Goliath. He is literally a giant of a man. He comes down into that valley in between the two armies and he offers up a challenge to the men of Israel. He calls out for them to bring someone down and to fight with him. He is over six cubits tall, carrying all of this heavy armor. He is an imposing figure before God's army. Let's read together in First Samuel chapter 17, beginning in verse eight. It says that he stood and cried out to the armies of Israel and said to them, Why have you come out to line up for battle? Am I not a philistin And you the servants of Saul, choose a man for yourselves and let him come down to me. If he is able to fight with me and kill me,

Conrad Harkrider  05:13
then we will be your servants. But if I prevail against him and kill him, then you shall be our servants, and serve us. And the Philistines said, I defy the armies of Israel this day. Give me a man that we may fight together. When Saul and all Israel heard these words of the Philistine, they were dismayed and greatly afraid. Throughout the book at First Samuel, and this was something that Matt helped point out to us. There are a number of descriptions and details that are given from the life of Saul and the life of David. And those details are not just meant to stand separate are in isolation, but rather to help the reader to draw comparisons between these two men. First of all, when Saul is chosen to be king in First Samuel chapter nine, Samuel comes to him, and he sees this man and he is described in First Samuel nine and verse two, he is more handsome than all the people who are in Israel. It says that he was taller, ahead taller than any other man in the country. From the outside, he absolutely looked. The part. David, on the other hand, is, comes from very humble beginnings. He is the son of an older man named Jesse, a shepherd from the little town of Bethlehem. He's the youngest of eight brothers, in a Jewish family and the oldest brother was given distinction. He received a double portion of the inheritance. But David is eighth in line, he's way down the list. When Samuel comes to Jesse to anoint the next king of Israel, David is not even invited. He's not even given a chance to stand before the judge of Israel because he's off taking care of the sheep. There are many contrasts between Saul and David. And in this account, notice what is said in verse 11. It says, When Saul and all Israel heard the words of the Philistine, they were dismayed, and greatly afraid. Saul and his men hear the challenge from the Philistine and they are terrified. Verse 16, tells us that this went on for a period of 40 days, Goliath would come down into the valley and offer up these challenges. And no man would answer the call. No man, including the three older brothers of David who had joined themselves to solve army. No man, including the tallest man in Israel, Saul, he was apparently unwilling to go fight the tallest man among the Philistines. But in comes David. David is not in the army. He's not one of Saul's trained warriors. His father, instead has sent him off to take care of the sheep. His father calls for him and tells him to run an errand. He says, I want you to take some bread and some cheese to the your brothers and their commanders. And I want you to get an update from the battlefield and bring back word about how they're doing. Look at verse 20, of chapter 17.

Conrad Harkrider  08:44
It says, So David Rose early in the morning, left the sheep with a keeper and took the things and went as Jesse had commanded him. And he came to the camp as the army was going out to fight and shouting for the battle for Israel and the Philistines had drawn up and battle array army against Army and David left his supplies and the hand of the supply keeper ran to the army and came and greeted his brothers. David gets up early in the morning. He leaves the sheep with a keeper contrary to what his older brother would accuse him of later on. His brother says that he left the sheep. But David is not acting irresponsibly. Here he listens to his father and goes in to the camp. Notice that David was a man who made a difference because he volunteered for service. Here we see David voluntarily going out into the service of King Saul. Notice verse 22. It says David left his supplies in the hand of the supply keeper and ran to the army. David is not reluctant he He is not afraid he's not trying to get out of this quickly as possible. He doesn't just run the errand and then head back to the sheep, he goes closer to the battle lines, instead of further away. Again, notice the contrast here with King Saul. First Samuel chapter 10. And verse 22, tells us about when Saul was going to be appointed as king. And it says, so they inquired again of the Lord, there is, is there a man still to come? And the Lord said, Behold, he has hidden himself among the baggage. We're not sure why Saul was hiding, Was he being modest or shy? Did he not feel worthy of this honor, perhaps, perhaps it was a lack of trust in God. Maybe he was unwilling to accept the role that God had now placed in front of him. But notice the contrast with David. Instead of hiding among the baggage, he drops the stuff off and heads out to be with the other men. He is eager, he's excited to join the army, he rushed towards the challenge, instead of shying away from it, David made a difference because he voluntarily went out to fight for the Lord. In our world today, when groups and organizations are looking for some help, it's not uncommon for them to try to incentivize people to couple their request with some type of benefit. So if you give $10, then you'll get a free T shirt. Or if you enter into this, support this cause then you'll be entered into a raffle for a $500 gift card, or anyone who comes out today there, they'll receive a free lunch from a local barbecue place. And we think to ourselves, you know, that is a worthy cause. I think I might actually go and check that out and see what's what's going on. We've gotten into the mindset that our time and effort is only worth sharing. If there's something in it for me, what is in it for me? When I was younger, I was staying at the house while my mom went out to the store. And I noticed that there was some dirt on the carpet, probably my dirt. And so I went to the closet and got the vacuum cleaner out and I cleaned up the mess. And by some unknown force, I continued to vacuum and ended up vacuuming the entire downstairs of the house. When my mom got back home, she was shocked. And also a little scared. She said, Has someone been in the house? Is there a did you call a cleaning service? What has happened? Because maybe for the first time in my life, I had voluntarily done a chore? Do we have an attitude like David, where we see a need an opportunity

Conrad Harkrider  13:16
where there is something that needs to be done, and we hurry to offer assistance. We don't have to be enticed. We don't have to be persuaded. We don't have to be coerced. We simply volunteer our help and support because that's the right thing to do. In second Corinthians chapter eight, Paul speaks to the jinn about the generosity of the Christians. And he says, For they gave according to their means, as I can testify and beyond their means of their own accord, begging us earnestly for the favor of taking part in the relief of the saints. And this not as we expected, but they gave themselves first to the Lord and then by the will of God to us. The Macedonian Christians were themselves struggling and dealing with hardship. And yet look at what their actions look at the type of impact that it had on Paul. He's after seeing their eagerness. He is overwhelmed with their generosity. What a difference it can make, and certainly it did for David. When a man or woman of God volunteers for service in helping others. When David finally gets to the battle line, he quickly realizes that this situation is not good. Goliath has come out again to make his taunts verse 24, says that when the men saw him they were Are dreadfully afraid. Everyone is fleeing away from the giant. But notice what verse 26 says, verse 26, says, Then David spoke to the men who stood by him saying, What shall be done for the man who kills this Philistine and takes away the reproach from Israel? For who is this uncircumcised Philistine, that he should defy the armies of the living God? We see here in verse 26, that David made a difference because he acknowledged God's presence. Notice that he doesn't even refer to the giant by name. And in fact, nowhere in the Scriptures do we have record of David ever speaking his name, he simply calls him or refers to him as this uncircumcised Philistine. David, instead of being awestruck, and amazed by his size and his stature, he's not cowering at his threats. He's not thinking that this guy is enormous, and there's no possible way that he can be defeated. But instead, David saw something that was even greater. David acknowledged that God's army that the men of Israel, they had God's presence that God was with them. Goliath was not just taunting Saul and his men. But as David points out, he was defying the armies of the living God. Look at what verse 45 says, Then David said to the Philistine, you come to me with a sword and a spear, and with a javelin, but I come to you, in the name of the Lord of hosts, the God of the armies of Israel, whom you have defied. When David goes out to meet the giant, he's not carrying a sword, or a spear, or a javelin. He doesn't have any weapons of iron, but instead he goes out in the name of the Lord of hosts, David recognized that his strength and his power came from the Lord. You know, when we're facing spiritual battles in our life, when we come face to face with the enemy, whether it be some type of temptation, or sin, or setback or challenge, do we remember who it is that is standing beside us? Do we remember who is on our side?

Conrad Harkrider  17:44
We don't go into the conflict alone. As David says, Here, the Lord of hosts was with them. And he provides us the strength and the means and the power to overcome in Second Kings, verse chapter 16. You remember the story when Elijah praise to the Lord, and asks that the servants eyes would be open so that he could see all of the chariots and the horses of fire that lined the hillside. On the outside, it may seem like we are the only person that is standing up for what is right, that we're the only person that's trying to make the right choice to do the right thing. But ultimately, we are not alone. There are other brothers and sisters that are trying to serve God faithfully. But even if they're not with us, the Lord is standing beside us, He is with us, to give us strength. And that's what we see in David. He knew where his strength came from, he knew the source of his ability to overcome. He knew that he would be successful because of the Lord. David recognized God. When we think about acknowledging God's presence, it's not just knowing that God will be with us and will help us but it's also giving praise and glory to God when we are successful. When we do overcome, does God received the glory and the recognition for our successes, it's easy to think about my hard work, my planning, my education, my skill, my effort in all of this. But whatever success or victory or triumph we might attain in this life, none of it would be possible without the Lord. And so we need to give praise and honor and recognition to the one who is do so think about this. Someone says Congratulations on your promotion. You say God has truly blessed me or congratulations on The finishing school on your graduation. And you say without the Lord, none of this would have been possible. You have a beautiful family

Conrad Harkrider  20:12
we respond with God is good he has provided so much. We know those things, but we often don't express them. We don't give credit verbally, to the one who has given us all things. But David acknowledged the presence of God. When Saul hears about this man who is showing such great courage, he calls for him. And David comes and tells Saul, your servant, will go and fight. Look at verse 33. Verse 33, says, And Saul said to David, you are not able to go against this Philistine to fight with him, for you are a youth, and a man, and he a man of war from his youth. But David said to Saul, your servant used to keep his father's sheep, and when a lion or bear came and took a lamb out of the flock, I went out after it and struck it and delivered the lamb from its mouth. And when it arose against me, I caught it by the beard and struck and killed it. Your servant has killed both lion and bear, and this uncircumcised Philistine will be like one of them, seeing it, he has defied the armies of the living God. Moreover, David said, The Lord who delivered me from the paw of the lion, and from the paw of the bear, he will deliver me from the hand of this Philistine. And Saul said to David, go, and the Lord be with you. So I'll tells David, you're you're not able to fight this man. You are just a boy. And he has been a warrior since he was a boy, in boxing or wrestling, there's this concept of the weight class. And you have to be under a certain weight in order to compete against another opponent, 172 pounds, or whatever it is, and usually the the contenders are right up to that limit. And what Saul is saying here that the reason they do that in boxing is so that it is a fair fight, so that one person doesn't have an undue advantage. And what Saul is saying to David here is this is not an equal matchup here, you are not able to go out and to fight against him. You are too little. But even though David was a young man, he made a difference. Because we see here he remembered God's faithfulness. David remembered all that God had done up to this point in his life. He tells saw about the time when he was watching his father's sheep. And there was this threat not from a snake or a possum or some small animal that can be contained. But this is a ferocious beast, a lion, or a bear. And did you see what he said in verse 35. He said that when one of them would take one of the lambs in its mouth, he would grab it by the beard. He's not up in the tree stand with the rifle, taking this thing out. This is hand to hand or hand to paw combat, up close and personal. But yet David was able to overcome. In verse 37, he says that the Lord delivered him from the paw of the lion and the bear and he is going to to deliver him from this Philistine, David basically says, This is not my first time I'm not a newbie at this. And just as he was able to kill the lion and the bear, because of God's faithfulness, and because God is with him, he will be able to defeat the Philistine.

Conrad Harkrider  23:59
Do we trust in God's faithfulness? How many times does God have to provide? How many times does God have to answer a prayer to help us through before the next time we face a difficulty or challenge will believe that he's going to take care of us that he's going, he's going to see us through? It's easy when we face a challenge, to doubt, to question to question God to think how's this going to work out? What's going to happen in all of this, but what we see in David is that he would look back on his life. He looked back and saw all of the things that God had already done for him how he had protected him, how he had helped him how he had strengthened him. And David trusted that this obstacle would be the same it would be no different than what God had already done. As long as we seek God, He will never leave or forsake us. We can trust in Him. The one who has the power to heal the blind, to raise up the lame to raise up the dead he can provide power and strength to us today to overcome whatever we face. David made a difference because despite all of the other men who are there that day, who forgot about what God had done in the past, in his own life, David remembered God's faithfulness. David goes down to the brook. He chooses five stones, puts them into a shepherd's bag, not a warrior's satchel, but his own bag. David was not trying to be someone else. He wasn't trying to pretend, or put on another image or appearance. But he took what what he had and put his trust in God. David goes down into that valley and with one sling of the stone, he lands a hit in the forehead of the giant just below that bronze helmet that he was wearing. And Goliath falls to the ground. What we see here that happens next more than just killing that one Philistine, David made a difference because he ignited courage in others. David spurred, he ignited. He generated courage and faith in the other men that were around him. Look at verse 51. Verse 51, says, Therefore, David ran and stood over the Phillips Philistine, took his sword and drew it out of his sheath and killed him and cut off his head with it. And when the Philistines saw that their champion was dead, they fled. Now the men of Israel and Judah arose and shouted and pursued the Philistine as far as the entrance of the valley, to the gates of Akron. These are the same men of Israel and Judah, who just moments before we're cowering, we're hiding. We're dreadfully afraid. And now they have risen up with a great shout, and they are pursuing their enemies. And what's interesting is, it's not as if David has taken out 1000s He's, he's totally hampered the army of the Philistines. There's only one man that has been taken out that's been killed. But yet now the men of Israel and Judah have been emboldened to go and to fight to pursue their enemies because of one man's faith and trust in God. It produced courage in others. Do you realize that the same thing happens today when we are willing to stand up for what is right? When we are willing to have courage and put our faith and our trust in God? When we do the right thing? There is a ripple effect. Faith is contagious. And we see it all the time with our brothers and sisters. When we see someone else who is serving someone who is giving someone who is helping, that has a positive effect. It rubs off on those around them. When Brooklyn was younger and first learning to swim, we were doing everything that we could to try to get her to jump off the side of the pool into the water. And we explained it to her. We showed her we tried to talk to her about it. She had the floaties on we said mom and dad are going to be there to catch you didn't matter. She was not getting in that water.

Conrad Harkrider  28:47
We went to visit the cousins. You know what the cousins were doing? They were jumping in off the side. Within five minutes, no more problems. She's jumping in the water. I told my wife I said to the cousins eat vegetables to do they do they clean their room clean up the toys. This was positive peer pressure at its finest. When you step out in faith, when you speak up that has an impact when you serve God not because it's easy or convenient. But because it's the right thing to do. You're paving a trail you're making a path for others to follow. David didn't just make a difference in his own life and make things that make things better for himself. He helped those around him. Second Samuel chapter 21. Many years later, after David has been established as king, the text says and there was again war at GAF, where there was a man of great stature, who had six fingers on each hand and six toes on each foot 24 in number, and he also was descended from the Giants. And when he taunted Israel, Jonathan the son of Shemaiah, David's brother, struck him down. David wasn't the only one in Israel who slayed a giant. Because of his courage and what he did that day, many years later, his nephew, his brother's son, would rise up and strike down one who taunted the armies of the living God. One man can make a difference, not just in his day, but for generations to come. We're going to close this morning with a song of encouragement and invitation to invite any who might be here who need to respond to the gospel, our choices, what we decide to do today can have an impact and affect for many years to come. And the greatest decision that we could ever make is the choice to serve God to give our heart to him to follow him and submit ourselves to His will. If you're subject to the Lord's invitation, please come down to the front as we stand and sing this song.
