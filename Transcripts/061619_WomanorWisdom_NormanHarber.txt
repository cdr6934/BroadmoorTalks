Go ahead and turn in your Bibles to Proverbs chapter 31. Good to speak for you once again. Some of you might be thinking isn't proverbs 31 about the wife? And is this still Father's Day? And that's what I asked myself yesterday when I realized that today was Father's Day. Actually, I've been thinking about doing a lesson on proverbs 31 for quite some time. And I didn't realize that when I was being scheduled that it would be scheduled on Father's Day, but maybe towards the end of the lesson, we can see some applications to fathers. So, at the very first I'd like to just go ahead and read the text, Proverbs 31, beginning in verse 10, an excellent wife who can find she is far more precious than jewels, the heart of her husband trust in her and he will have no lack of gain. She doesn't good and not harm, and all all the days of her life. She seeks seeks wool and flax and works with her willing hands. She is like the ships of the merchant. She brings her food from afar. She rises while it is yet night and provides food for her household and portions for maintenance. She considers a field and buys it. With the fruit of her hands, she plants a vineyard. She dresses herself with strength and makes her arm strong. She perceives that her merchandise is profitable. Her lamp does not go out at night. She puts her hands to the distaff and her in her hands hold the spindle. She opens her hand to the poor and reaches out her hands to the needy. She is not afraid of snow for her household and all her household are clothed in scarlet. She makes bed coverings for herself. Her clothing is fine linen and purple. Her husband is known in the gates when he sits among the elders of the land. She makes linen garments and sells them she delivers sashes to the merchant, strength and dignity are her clothing and she laughs at the time to come. She opens her mouth with wisdom and the teaching of kindness is on her tongue. She looks well to the ways of her household and does not eat the bread of idleness. Her children rise up and call her blessing. Her husband also and he praises her. Many women have done excellently, but you surpass them all. Charm is deceitful and beauty is vain. But a woman who fears the Lord just to be praised, give her of the fruit of her hands and let her works praise her. In the gates. You have probably seen this section of scripture titled The worthy woman or the virtuous wife or the noble wife, the woman who fears the Lord, the wife of noble character, the capable wife, and some that I've come across in my study the competent wife, the valorous woman, or the woman of substance. But perhaps you haven't heard this passage described simply as Lady wisdom. And we'll speak about that a little bit later in the lesson. But let's let's investigate this a little bit. I'm going to break this lesson into two parts. And the first part I'm going to take the the view of this passage as the more traditional view that it is talking about an actual woman it is a wife. But a couple of background notes, we do need to realize that this is written in a structural way that was made for memorization. It is that it is located at the very end of Proverbs is kind of a exclamation point, let's say but it's written as an acrostic. There on the screen, that's the 22 verses in English but in in Hebrew, we you see it as it says on the screen. Now Hebrew, of course is written right to left. And since it's an acrostic, each line is written with a subsequent letter starting with the subsequent letter of the Hebrew alphabet. So putting the the Hebrew alphabet on there the Aleph, which you you see right here, you see that at the on the right hand side of the first line and then bait the the second letter starts the second line and so forth. And so it was used as a tool for memorization. But also it demonstrates an acrostic demonstrates the totality of the subject, it's practical wisdom from A to Z, you know, we would say so in in this case, it would present present a totality of of the subject. But in this passage, we do see a list of what she does, what her what her tasks are. And

Unknown Speaker  04:56
just because this was convenient, I went to mark Copeland's website executable outlines and just pulled off his outline of this passage. I know you can't read that very well, but, but just note what how the ideal wife is described. And he breaks it down into nine points. She's trustworthy and filled with enduring love. She has practical skills, she's industrious, she's compassionate, she has strong character, she speaks words of wisdom and kindness. And she diligent diligently seized her family's needs, and she fears the Lord. So I'm sure we've all seen outlines like that, of of this passage. And these do describe the qualities of a good spouse is as Mark says, they're at the end. And there's nothing that's really unreal about this, this could describe a real woman, these are real task. These are real duties that a real person could perform. And in support of that view that these verses describe a real woman. There are other verses in Proverbs that refer to a wife, already an excellent wife is the crown of her husband, but she who brings shame is like rottenness in his bones. Chapter 12 Verse four, he finds a wife finds a good thing and obtains favor from the Lord chapter 18, verse 22, house and wealth are inherited from fathers but a prudent wife is from the Lord chapter 19, verse 14, so those are passages about a real life. Why can't chapter 31 beginning with verse 10, be about a real wife as well, because the writer has already spoken of the value of a good woman. Well, as you might suspect, there are a lot of writers out there scholars and commentators who have written much about this, this poem, and it is called a poem by many. But one writer, Ellen Davis wrote this, which I thought was pretty insightful. The present poem was probably created not to honor one particularly praiseworthy woman, but rather to underscore the central significance of women's skilled work in a household based economy. The fact that the poem ends on a strong, strongly imperative note, and that being let her works praise her in the gates may suggest that women did not often receive public recognition for their role in maintaining the well being of family and community. It is likely the poem was composed in the period after the Babylonian exile, when, with the collapse of the great national centers of government and religion, the home became the central social and religious institution, the place where Israelite identity was established. She goes on to make some good points in addition to that, and she she does say, and I think I agree that it might be difficult for today's woman, especially in America to appreciate or relate to the Pope on. It is agreed generally that that woman who women who work at home now in our culture in our society are given little public admiration in our society. We have profoundly different cultures now than when this poem was written in different functions and technology and so forth. The cultures are just so different. And now our home is primarily a place of not production, but consumption. How many of us in our homes produce anything? Now there are some homes with home based businesses, I get that. But what what do most of us produce besides garbage? What comes out of our house? Now, that's very different than the way this country was 7500 125 years ago, when the home was more productive type of center. But few of us try to be self sufficient, like producing our own food, and clothes for that matter. So that actually affects the way we view this passage. It seems to be saying that true happiness or contentment has found, at least for the most part, in being self sufficient. Look at verses 11 and 12. And your text in verses 28 and 29.

Unknown Speaker  09:22
If you think about that, it's true that any person who requires little beyond what they produce themselves, is utterly free of anxiety about the future. That just makes sense. I can provide for myself, I'm not worried about that. But many of us are anxious about our jobs sometimes, or the stability of our economy that upholds our jobs. Or we're anxious about our way where our next paycheck is coming from. I think there's something something to that to the way we view this passage. So it might be saying it's wise to work in such a way to be free of anxiety. Structure plays a big part in understanding certain texts. And that is the case here. Many commentators say that verses 19 and 20 are a connector to the first part and the second part of verses 10 through 31. I may just say, Proverbs 31. But what I mean in verse is verses 10 through 31. That in verses 19 and 20, you have a bridge of the first part to the second part. So I've highlighted there and I'm going to lift that out. It says she puts her hands to the distaff, which is a type of spindle, and her hands hold the spindle, she opens her hand to the poor and reaches out her hands to the needy. Now, some have taken that and seen a chiasm there, that the first part, her hands that she extends to the distaff. And then the last part, her hands, she extends to the needy are related. And then the two enter point points her palms grasp the spindle, and her palms spreads out to the poor. Well, that's the bridge, the first bark part being the the time speed she spends with her home. And then the second part of the poem being the part that she spends in the world or more social aspect of her work. And there's something to that. So it's a transition from her home business to the business of helping the needy. In a larger outline, there are four sections that verses 19 and 20, correspond to verses 30, and 31, which is like a CODA, or an ending to the poem. And then there's two nine verse sections, verses 10, through 18. And verses 21 through 29. In other words, the first part and the second part, so it would look like this, you have verses 10, through 18, or the first part 19, and 20, are a bridge or a pivot. And then the second part, verses 21, through 29, and verse 30, through 31, or the coda or the ending, which kind of correspond back to verses 19, through 20. And I'll say a little bit more about that as we go. But it has been outlined this way, as well by Bruce Waltke, who wrote who writes a very good commentary on Proverbs, He breaks it down into three points, her value, her activities and her praise. And basically the middle part there, where he talks about her activities are just what we talked about her cottage industry, verses 13 through 18. And then the bridge he calls it a Janus or a scene, and then her show social activities and verses 20 through 27. So when we see it broken down, I think that helps us understand what the the point of the of the poem is. In this outline is it's simplified, but basically says the same thing that in verses 13 through 19, she works hard and provides for her family and verse 20, through 27, she uses her wealth, and her wisdom to bless others. So the point being that the woman is the embodiment of wise living. And what's even more interesting is that we can break down those two sections, or analyze them even further, verses 13 through 19, and 2327. That's right, there's two more chiasm, there's a double chiasm here, you knew you weren't going to get through this lesson with that a lot of chi isms. But they I didn't know about it until I got into the lesson. So I got into studying it. So the point being of the of the first section, a chiasm being where the central point or the main point is at the center of the text, and then you have corresponding points that flare out or in a symmetrical pattern from there. So the main point of the first section is that she profits and invest from her work. And in the second part, the focus is that the husband is respected at the gates. That's that's her purpose. So it's interesting that that these break down even to central points even in themselves. So the it's fascinating to me that the writer went to such lengths to make these points for us to investigate and discover on our own

Unknown Speaker  14:21
a slightly different view. That some take is that this a superwoman does that no woman could possibly do all of this. It's an impossible standard. As someone said, she's a Pinterest board come to life. And another writer said, Now in case you need to recap, this hypothetical woman in Proverbs 31, is skillful in a lot of different things. Scratch that she's skillful in Everything. According to the chapter, she wakes up super early, has great biceps buys property, whereas a lot of purple cares for her kids cares for the poor, keeps her home warm at night and doesn't eat carbs. She does everything. And another commentator said there's nothing left for the husband to do. Because she does everything. And some of those are tongue in cheek, of course. But if you think about it, it's not a complete list. Because what said about her religious life, really not much. What is how was she and her religious life? What is really said about the way she raises her children, not really much to about that. And there's really not a lot said about the husband wife relationship. So it's not really a checkoff list, a to do list. And that being said, I think we can make the point that God has uniquely created each woman. You're not all seamstresses, and you're not all sales women. You don't all import your food from afar, and you don't have servants. And you aren't all farmers, or real estate, real estate tycoons. And you don't all rise up early, and go to bed late every night working. And in fact, you're not all moms, and you're not all wives. So how could you possibly measure up? So if you don't measure up, are you not living according to the biblical standard. And I suspect some women have studied this passage and have come away with that feeling coming, you know, fun and little short. But I think that's the wrong way to approach proverbs 31. Because God doesn't want Christian women who check off the list. Instead, God wants Christian women to choose wisdom in their life. And choosing wisdom is going to look different for each woman depending on their culture, their position in life, their abilities, and their age, and so forth. So it's not a prescriptive list. And that means tasks to be performed by, you know, by women. But it's more a descriptive list, praise of the wise woman. In fact, if you analyze the poem, there's only one command there's only one prescription, or prescriptive praise given in the text and that's given to the man. It said, praise her in the gates. An interesting point is that the term worthy woman or translated excellent wife, in some places, in some versions, actually translates to the term Woman of Valor, which in the Hebrew is an I'm pronouncing it wrong, is shit. Chi eel, it's yet chi yield, something like that, a woman of valor, which we might say means carry on, warrior woman. Or we might say You go girl. The term valor here usually is applied to the male soldier. So it's interesting that it's used here of the woman. It's not used that often. It is used to other women in Scripture, but not that often. So some say this is written in what's called the heroic mode. The current culture of the time did not value women. So the writer in his goal of demonstrating wisdom in action also elevates the status of women, by using a woman to show that real heroism is displayed at home, and godly moral character rather than just by men on the battlefield. So women you can show moral character or valor in your everyday life. So it's not what you do, but how you do it if you do it with wisdom, and Proverbs 31 is is to be used as a celebration of wisdom working in your life. Another example, along these lines is Ruth. Just reminding you of her of her life of her situation, she was a destitute foreigner. Her daily work involves gathering threshing and winnowing wheat. Most of her story she was neither a wife nor a mother. And her her life looked nothing like the life of the woman depicted in Proverbs 31. She didn't spend her days making clothes for her husband. At the beginning of the story, she had no husband she was widowed. Her children didn't rise up and call her blessing because she was childless. She didn't spend her days exchanging fine linens with the merchants. She didn't keep her home immaculate. She worked all day in the sun gleaning leftovers from other people's fields, which was a provision made for the poorest of the poor. But guess what Boaz says of Ruth before she gets married before she has a child, and before she becomes a wealthy and influential woman, he said, and now my daughter do not fear I will do for you all that you ask for all my fellow townsmen know that you are worthy woman, that's the same phrase that is shut chi Yele. Woman of Valor. So Ruth is identified as a woman of valor, not because of some checked off list, but because she lived her life with incredible bravery and wisdom and strength. She lived her life with valor.

Unknown Speaker  20:39
So this seems to be a poem of praise of women. provided for for all women to follow or could it be something else? Might it be something more than what we're we're seeing here? Is that a worthy woman? Or might it be lady wisdom? So let me let me present an alternate view. Maybe you've heard this, maybe you haven't? Let me first present some objections to the standard view. So this section is commonly understood as a text defining great feminine qualities. But if that so some are saying that's a little perplexing, because it doesn't make sense in context. After all, what is this a closing to this is a closing to the book of Proverbs, which is all about wisdom, Solomon's epic work of wisdom and morality. So why would he choose to in this book by writing his ideal vision of womanhood? This section is the only acrostic in the book of Proverbs. So why use this highly recognizable pattern to describe women when the rest of the book seems to be dealing with wisdom only. So it seems it would make more sense to use this method of memorization for the topic of wisdom, not women, per se. So a brief breakdown of Proverbs. Many have noted that the topics that you find in the first nine chapter of Proverbs are very similar to what we see in Proverbs 31. In fact, they form and include do which are bookends to the middle part of Proverbs and includes the Oh, as a literary stylistic device that marks the literary boundaries of a subject are a unit of material. So chapters one through nine, and 31 are the framework around the rest of the proverbs. And if you remember chapter, if you just open your book, open your Bible to the middle of Proverbs, you're just going to find seemingly random Proverbs, not a narrative, not like a story, like you see at the end of Proverbs, and at the beginning of Proverbs, but you see more random proverbs. Whereas if you read chapters one through nine, they do read like a story. They read like a narrative, and chapter 31 reads like a story, or narrative. And just to note that, look at the change from chapter nine. And you might notice in your Bible, I've got some of it on the screen. But here's the end of chapter nine, when the woman Foley or Dame Foley, su sometimes called, is described a woman Folly is loud, and she is seductive, seductive, but knows nothing. She sits at the door of her house, and she takes a seat on the highest places of the town, calling to those who pass by who are going straight on their way, whoever is simple, let him turn in here. And to him who lacks sense she says, stolen water is is sweet, and bread eaten and secret is pleasant, but he does not know that the dead are there, that her guests are in the depths of shields. So that reads like a story. That's the end of chapter nine. That brings us to the end of the first nine chapters. Now look at chapter 10. abrupt ending just says, the proverbs of Solomon chapter 10, verse one, and then look what you get. Kind of random Proverbs, A wise son makes a glad father but a foolish son has a sorrow to his mother. The next one treasures gained by wickedness do not profit, but righteousness delivers from death. And it goes on like that for 20 chapters until you get to the end of the book. So that's just to demonstrate how it changes abruptly and then changes back. Once you get to chapter 31. There are topical connections that are illustrated on the screen. I've got two or three slides here. That were some have have noticed that what we read up in detail in Chapters one through nine, are repeated in chapter 31, and a brief synopsis. So topics like security of her house, you know that's described of wisdom. And in chapter eight, verse 34, but also in chapter 31. Preparation and diligence you remember the passage about you know, go to the ant you sluggard and learn from the aunt. Well, the woman is described as being a hard worker as well in chapter 31 And verse 13, through 27. Both are resourceful lady wisdom and the the woman of chapter 31. Both are prosperous, both are kind to the poor, and so on. So there is this connection, a tie in of topics between the first chapter, first nine chapters and chapter 31. Hannah Rasmussen in her article on this, this passage, says the ideal life looks strikingly similar to the Father's personification of wisdom,

Unknown Speaker  25:36
both talk about how Prophet is good. Both are described as difficult to find the wife of chapter 31 and wisdom. They both offer security or provide food, they're both known at the city gates, and so on, you can so you can see the similarities between the first nine chapters in chapter 31. And then I put this up there because I know you can't read it whatsoever. That's pretty small, is it but author Glen Pemberton has done a extended study of the of this, this topic, where on the left, he has 14 topics that are in Chapters one through nine that are repeated in chapter 31, some of those I had on the previous screens. So that's all to say that people are noticing this, scholars and people smarter than me that they see that connection. So there is also a little bit of gender bias in Proverbs we might say, because it seems if you read chapters one through nine, it seems like it's a book written by men for men. Remember all the sayings of the Father to the Son, the Y sayings of the Father to the Son, don't, don't follow the lady of folly don't don't follow the the ways of the prostitute and so forth. But the way that he instructs his son is by use of the female gender and several different ways. And of course, wisdom is often referred to as she in Proverbs, as in this example, chapter four verse seven, get wisdom get insight, do not forget and do not turn away from the words of my mouth, do not forsake her and she will keep you love her and she will guard you the beginning of wisdom of this is this Get wisdom, and whatever you get, get insight. Prize her highly and she will exalt you, she will honor you, if you embrace her, she will place on your head a graceful garland, she will bestow on you a beautiful crown. And and over and over again. You see, wisdom and folly for that matter described as in the female gender. So in chapter 31, that motif is repeated in a tangible example, used as the wife female gender. So other examples I put on the screen and Foley is also personified as a she as well. In Proverbs one through nine, Mr. Pemberton has also noted that there are five women used in teaching young man. First, the young man's mother speaks alongside his father, the writer speaks about the young man's wife and chapter five, then the writer speaks about that strange woman that the young men is not to follow. And the writer speaks about a woman named Wisdom, what I've been calling lady wisdom. And then there's that woman Foley. So over and over again with different examples, the the female gender is used in a way to teach the young man about wisdom. So, again, a brief breakdown of the, the chapters in, in Proverbs so in Chapters one through nine, you have a father teaching his son about choosing wisdom over folly. And then we might say in in the middle chapters, chapters 10, through 30, or the first part of the 31. You have in detail, what it means to to choose wisdom over folly, described in detail for the young man. So then when you get to the end of Proverbs, the ending you were asking the question, well, what choice did he make? did he choose folly? Or did he choose wisdom? While the writer saying he chose wisdom and married her? The sun is still the intended audience even in chapter 31. So chapter 31 is a synopsis of wisdom, not so much about the woman But about the choice that the young man has made. And the author brings glory to the ordinary and mundane task of life to illustrate wisdom, and action, the woman of chapter 31 is an allegory for wisdom. She is wisdom personified. And so here is the final appearance of Lady wisdom who has made her appearance over and over again in the first nine chapters. But here's her final appearance at the end of the book, reaffirming the promises to those who pursue a relationship with her I

Unknown Speaker  30:32
should have said this earlier, but I'm not really addressing the first nine verses of Proverbs 31. I'll leave that to someone else at another time. Those who are chapter 31 is actually two poems, written by King lineal as taught to him by his mother, verses one through nine in verses 10 through 31. Although some think that verses 10 through 31, were written by another author. There are structural similarities and thematic similarities between the two. But I'm only focusing on the second poem in chapter 31. So I think there's something to this possibly, that this is just a continuation of the teaching of the young son and the choices he's going to have to make. While there's another outline that's been suggested for verses 10 through 31, that, when you were, if you were to summarize and abbreviate the verses as as we have them on the screen, if you're to look at those, and if you eliminate the, the top two points, and eliminate the SEC, the bottom point, and you'll see they're very similar. If you just look at the list, which of those doesn't really seem to belong, or looks different. And it seems to be that the point is, that is made that the husband gets respect, the rest of those are dealing with what the woman does, but at the very center, you have public respect for the husband. So and then if you, you would notice that there are parallel similar thoughts on either side of that, so you know, where I'm going, there are coverings for the bed, the wife wears linen, and she sells garments and sashes, the children are clothed in scarlet, which is parallel to the wife clothed in dignity, no fear of snow versus no fear of future. So each of these points, and we've been over some of these before, they seem to be parallel, but centered on this thought that there is public respect for the husband. And so one, at least one author, or one commentator has made the point that this is a the whole passage is a chiasm centered on the public respect for the husband. So the Cayambe is chiasm is actually pointing to the man. So the heart of this poem is that's seemingly about a wife is really the husband. But why would that be? Well, and just what we've said, the type of woman that young men should pursue, as a wife, that's wisdom. That's, that's your that's the outcome of wisdom. If you want to be successful, if you want to be respected. You choose a godly wife or wife that fears God. So we're being told the ending of the story of Proverbs that the young man chose wisdom, and he chose well. So remember the instructions of the Father to the Son in the first nine chapters, follow lady wisdom, not Dame Foley. And here at the end, if you want to be successful in life, choose wisdom as your wife or a wife of wisdom. And one commentator said the husband is esteemed and respected by his peers, and Picard, in part because she created a world for him in which he could be everything God wanted him to be. So you see how the tables returned a little bit? Maybe that's a little bit different than the way we've thought about this passage. But if you take that view, you can still see this as instructional to the wife. Because then perhaps wife should be asking, Can my husband trust me to be a good steward of the home? Are the ways that I talk and act and dress? Are they respectful to him? Do my activities benefit or take away from my husband and as we read in Proverbs 12, for an excellent wife, who is the crown of her husband, but she she who brings shame is like rottenness in his bones. So, in this perspective, the writer is making the point that wives should do all they can do to help their husbands, be all that God would have them to be and that God would be glorified through his plan for marriage. Now saying all that that's not to say that a woman is merely an appendage for the man who exists solely for the honor of the man, I believe the passage still elevates the status and honor of a woman. Why would why would the writer choose a woman to illustrate wisdom unless he had great respect for her. But the woman is shown to have intelligence, energy, character and compassion. And she's not just an accessory by no means. So the man is taught to choose a mate that will bring Him joy and not misery. And that's the choice between wisdom and folly that he's given in the earlier chapters of Proverbs.

Unknown Speaker  35:33
So, note that the opening and closing verses seem to indicate that it's the man being instructed if you read those verses, an excellent will, an excellent wife who can find she is far more precious than jewels, the heart of her husband, trust in her, and he will have no life gain. I mean, that could be said, that can be addressed to the man. And in the end, Charm is deceitful and beauty is vain. But a woman who fears the Lord is to be praised. You know, we think that's, that's written to the woman. But that can be written to the man that the woman you're choosing, don't be deceived by charm and beauty. That's what chapters one through nine we're about to. But look beyond that a woman who fears the Lord is to be praised, give her the fruit of her hands and let her works, praise her. Let's get basically said to the man, and not to the woman. And I've read in my studies that in Jewish Jewish culture still today, it's the men who memorize this passage, this poem, and not the women. And they sing it as a song of praise to the women in their lives. It's pretty interesting in them. So I've spoken of the of the young man and two ways that he chooses wisdom over folly, or he makes a wise choice in choosing a wife. So which is, well, perhaps we, we may think of chapter 31, as an exhortation to the young man to find not only lady wisdom. But if you do Mary, find a literal living and breathing wise woman to share your life with. So maybe there was a reason to preach us on Father's Day. Maybe in hopes of becoming a father, the young man should seek out a woman of wisdom. So, as we wrap up the lesson, we learn about, you know, with any view we take, we're still going to learn about wisdom. And that's the point. We're being instructing about wisdom, wisdom is right living, it's good decisions. It's honorable choices. The Proverbs 31 poem presents a pattern for all people to follow both women and men. And that's the point of the entire Book of Proverbs summarized here. In a few verses. The word the woman was a role model for all Israel to follow. wise women aspire to be like her wise men seek to marry her. And all people aim to imitate the wisdom she embodies in their own life. And proverbs 31 could be looked at as a mirror to see the type of person that you should be or I should be. So are you someone who is wise at life, both for the male and the female. So don't worry, if you read this chapter, and you think I just, I just can't measure up to that. I can't live up to that it's a guide to wise living, that everyone can aspire to. So maybe we shouldn't be too quick to emphasize one view over another whether it's about an excellent wife or it's about a man seeking a wife. Let's just let each person make the best application to their own life. And it may be that the author leaves it deliberately ambiguous whether this poem is describing wisdom or the ideal wife, really, the two are not mutually exclusive. It's wise to pursue a wise wife. In fact, marrying this kind of woman would be a strong indicator of the young man's wisdom. But the application for us as readers as the audience seems to be clear. A young man will be rewarded for valuing and seeking wisdom, which involves fearing the Lord working hard and devoting his life to a woman who does the same. Hannah Rasmussen said this. In her article on this passage, she said the book of Proverbs, thus concludes with the message with which it began, seek wisdom and you will be rewarded. It ends with a vivid memory aid for the student of wisdom and alphabetic acrostic, describing the female embodiment of wisdom that the man should literally and metaphorically pursue and embrace more broadly applied the Proverbs 31 Woman encourages both men and women to value seek and praise wisdom throughout life.

Unknown Speaker  39:54
I think you summed it up pretty well. And we all remember that too. Using wisdom begins with fearing the Lord. The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom. And the knowledge of the Holy One is inside. That's the theme of the book of Proverbs. And it's repeating repeated multiple times in the book. So proverbs 31, is that the worthy woman or Lady wisdom? Well, maybe we'll just leave it with being the worthy woman and Lady wisdom. Perhaps we should take them together, they positively reinforce each other. The the wise human wife has great value when she chooses wisdom, and wisdom is humanized, when she's made part of everyday life. And the young man should pursue wisdom. And that's really whether he marries or not, he still should pursue wisdom. So a final word to the the women in the audience. So to all the women who are feeding babies, and are changing diapers, maybe longing to have a baby, or are honoring their husband by their life. Or if you're unmarried, if you're honoring God and others by your single life. If you're teaching and studying the Word of God, if you're going to work to help pay the bills, if you're helping the sick and needy, if you're being a full time caregiver, or if you're just being an example, to the young, through your presence. Like tonight services, you're all women of Valor is shit. Chi eel, carry on warriors carry on with wisdom. And according according to what we studied tonight, your life is worthy of poetry. Because the writer wrote about you. I hope that's been helpful. Feel free to disagree, and feel even free or to agree with me later. It's been an interesting study. Maybe you've never heard that maybe you have hope it's been helpful. You may need to respond to the invitation tonight that invitation is always open. You don't have to respond right now at this time. But if you need the prayers of the congregation, you can take one of the members aside and talk to them privately. If you want to be baptized, you don't have to do it right now. This is a good time but if not, if you'd rather do it later, you can talk to somebody and talk about your your spiritual state with somebody privately and we can baptize you at some other time. But just know that the Lord's invitation is always open and if your subject come now is where you stand and sing
