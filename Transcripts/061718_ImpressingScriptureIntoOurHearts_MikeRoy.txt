It's always such a great opportunity when we can come together and worship and praise our God. That's why he made us He made us to honor him to serve him to worship Him to to obey his will. And when we do that, we give Him the honor and the praise that that we that he deserves. Now, I'm thankful in our country that we honor our fathers and mothers a couple times a year, at least officially we do. As it relates to the family, raising children and teaching them to love, serve and obey God is the most important thing that we'll ever do as parents. There's nothing that compares with teaching and training children to love and serve God today, we think the father, so I thought I would just use this. This day is a way to challenge us to think about our responsibility. And even in the bigger picture, appreciate those songs, and they lead for us this morning. They remind us that first and foremost we are to love God with every fiber of our being is somebody who said that it's relatively easy to become a dad. It's very difficult to be a father, to raise to lovingly teach and train our children, we work in connection with our wives, obviously. But I've chosen a text this morning from the Old Testament that addresses the issue of teaching and training children. But I will say before we teach and train our children to love and serve and obey God, we have to teach and train ourselves and oppress God's Word in our own hearts and minds in such a way that we are controlled by his word. And our children see that. And so I recognize it's our responsibility as as fathers especially, to provide the spiritual and moral direction of our family, we raise children with fathers and mothers and everywhere that's possible. But we recognize it in Scripture, God has placed the responsibility of providing leadership and guidance in the home on the shoulder of the fathers. Like the the mindset of Joshua is expressed in Joshua Chapter 20, verse 24, in verse 15, when he said, But as for me, in my house, we will serve the Lord. And so, so far this morning is that your mindset is that are resolved that we're going to serve God and put him first in our lives. And so this morning, I want to look at this text. In Deuteronomy, chapter six, verses four through nine, if you've got your Bibles open, you might turn them we'll have that on the screen as well. But there's lots of messages that come from this text in Deuteronomy, chapter six, and these few verses, but there's a an image there I want us to think about, and it reflects the need for us to practice certain things in our lives. And one of the things that comes out of this text is Moses is telling the people of Israel as they prepare to go into the Promised Land, what they need to do is impress God's Word into their hearts and minds. And then they can do that for their children or another way we to wrap God's word around their hearts and minds. And so we're going to focus in some ways, on disciplining and training our children to love, honor and serve God. But before we do that, we have to do that ourselves. We have to take God's word and impressed that into our hearts and minds. So let's look at this Texas morning. And then go ahead and talk about that. I just going to be looking at some other scriptures to support some principles in this in the the lesson this morning. But this is mainly the primary text that I want us to look at this morning. In Deuteronomy, chapter six, in verses four through nine, Moses said, Here, O Israel, the LORD our God, the Lord is One, you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul with all your might. And these words that I command you today shall be on your heart, you shall teach them diligently to your children, and shall talk to them when you sit in your house when you walk, by the way, when you lie down, and when you rise, you shall bind them as a sign on your hand and they shall be as frontlets between your eyes. You shall write them on the doorposts of your house and on your gates. There's so much in this brief text to talk about that we're just going to focus on these few verses, and look at some lessons that God is conveying to us. So the first thing I want you to see there, in verse four, is a simple statement that we might read pass too quickly.

Mike Roy  04:54
Moses is speaking to Israel and this is the charge he gives them the instruction that he gives him he says here Er, O Israel, the LORD our God, the Lord is one. So the first point I want us to understand this morning that Moses unequivocally affirms that there is only one God. And obviously, we need to give him the reverence because of that fact. But he stresses that, and that's, that's the first thing that he says to these people in this context. He wants them to hear this message. The Lord our God is one there is only one God. Some people believe that this verse stresses the unity of the Godhead, and maybe that's true. But this verse also affirms that there is no other God and there is no other God than the Lord of heaven and earth. And God's people needed to learn this as they go into a land and a culture that was given to idolatry, that one of the greatest sins of Israel, and challenges that they faced with the sin of idolatry. And they were bowing down to every stick in stone in graven image in Idol of gold and silver, that was the major downfall. And before we dismiss idolatry is a temptation in our lives, we recognize that we all may have idols that we have to keep ourselves from. But this is the message that that Moses is giving to the people of Israel, it's repeated. Just a couple chapters back and chant and chapter four. Again, Moses is trying to prepare these people to take the promised land. And most what he says in verse 35, he said to you, it was shown that you might know that the Lord is God, how come they didn't know that, and he kept stressing it. And he said, that there is no other besides him out of heaven, he let you hear His voice, that he might discipline you. And on earth, he let you see his great fire. And you heard his words out of the midst of the fire, and because he loved your fathers, and chose their offspring after them, and brought you out of Egypt with his own presence by his great power, driving up before you nations greater and mightier than you to bring you in to give you their land for inheritance as it is this day, Leo, verse 39, no there for today. No there for today and lay it to your heart that the Lord is God in heaven above and on earth beneath. Right. And then he says that there is no other VISTA first message the point that Moses is making to the people Israel, that there is only one God, and there's no one in heaven or on earth that compares to him in holiness, in power and strength and grace and mercy. And so, we we need to recognize that principle that we when we look at this brief facts, that there is only one God, and we understand that and we would Amen. This point this morning, right? We all agree that that God is God, there's no God like him. But we need to realize the implications that follow from that. I'm told that this section of Scripture, I'm not don't have Hebrew down is called the Shanna or Sheena. And that this was the first passage of Scripture, that Jewish families would teach their children every morning and every evening in an Orthodox Jewish home.

Mike Roy  08:19
So again, it reminds us of a simple and powerful truth. And we all recognize that is that there is only one God. Our world is filled with all types of gods and concepts of gods and idolatry. But we understand that there is only one God. And so if we go back to the text in connection with that, I want to suggest, secondly, that we must love this great and awesome God with every fiber of our being. So you go back to our text. The second point really coming in verse five. Moses tells these people, you shall love the Lord your God, with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind. It's easy to be religious, it's easy to go to church, and we might even memorize certain things, but when he's talking about here is that we love God, with every ounce of strength that is in our minds in our bodies. This is a total dedication to God, as Mark talked about this morning in the class. This is a commitment unlike anything else. And so that's the second point I want to stress from Moses message here is that yes, there is only one God, He is great. He is awesome, as we were saying just a few minutes ago, but we have to love Him, serve Him, trust Him and obey Him. With every fiber of our being with every breath that we take. That's the type of attitude that we need to have as we serve God. And this is the message that Moses is challenging these Jews to internalize as they think about Going into the promised land. It's interesting in the New Testament, remember when the Pharisees, the lawyer came along, and he's trying to trap Jesus and verse 34, when the Pharisees had heard that he had silenced the Sadducees. They gather together and one of them a lawyer asked him a question to test Him. The Lord didn't want to know what the truth was. He knew what the law said about what's the number one commandment and all the Bible of Scripture. He knew what that was. But he's trying to trip up Jesus to catch him in some way. And so he said, Teach your wit, which is the great commandment or the greatest commandment, that law. And in verse 37, Jesus said to me, shall love the Lord your God, with all your heart with all your soul, with all your mind, and with all your mind, this is the great and first commandment. So when Jesus was asked this question by this lawyer in the first century, this is the text that Jesus quoted in Deuteronomy, chapter six, verses four through nine.

Mike Roy  10:58
So we understand what this means, then, since there is only one God, He is worthy of all glory, and praise and honor. But what God is looking for from each one of us, is sincere love and devotion, praise and honor. That's why God gave us lips and mouths, and ears and all that, so that we can shout his praises. And in the end, he wants us to love him. And again, it's easy to sometimes go through motions and kind of slide away from something so foundational, but that's the second message I want us to learn from this text that yes, there is only one God. And we give him everything that we have is so different from the culture that we live in the third point I want you to notice from this Texas morning, go back. And due to Deuteronomy, chapter six, verse six, that we are basically to take God's word and impress it into our hearts and mind we have to wrap God's word around our mind. So verse six, when Moses is telling these people, and sharing these foundational principles, you said, and these words that I command you today, shall be on your heart, you know, we read past that don't think a lot about that. It may be like we should. But this is this is a lifelong activity, taking these commands that God has given to us, and putting them on our hearts, in our hearts, to wrap our hearts with these principles, and, again, this plain teaching of God's command of God is something that is easy for us to overlook, and let that slip past us. So the challenge then is to take God's word, one reason we stress, reading, getting on some type of reading program Bible reading program here, Broadmoor so that we can put God's Word in our hearts in our minds and ultimately be transformed by this. But this message is echoed throughout Scripture for what God is looking for, not people who are just sort of like robots can go through the motions and attend a worship service or even maybe, say some things, even quote some some of his words, but but he wants those things to be internalized in our hearts and in our minds. Notice, and, again, that's the emphasis that God's word needs to be in our hearts. In the New Testament, we see this message that is repeated in James chapter one. And verse 21. James says, this says this, Therefore put away all filthiness and rampant wickedness, and receive with meekness the implanted word, which is able to save your soul. So God tells us to put aside filthiness, to pull aside wickedness and sin gets get this stuff out of our hearts out of our minds. And then in contrast to that, to receive with humidity or meekness, the implanted word, the only place that God's words can have an impact on us is in our hearts and in our minds, taking God's word, and put that into our hearts. And so the idea of visualizing Heaven and Hell, in the approaching Day of Judgment is doing just that, taking God's word and putting that in our hearts and mind and in such a way that it changes who we are. So, again, we recognize the greatness of God, the holiness of God, His mercy, His justice, all of that. We need to understand him that we must love Him with every fiber of our beings and we must impress his word into the deepest recesses of our hearts and minds. So this is not a superficial thing. This is something that is very, very deep. Again, you look at the Old Testament in Psalm chapter 119, and verse, verses nine through 11. The psalmist says,

Mike Roy  14:52
How can a young man keep his way pure? How do we live a life of purity? In an age of impurity, we all battle with God Keeping improper thoughts out of our minds on a regular basis, how can a young man keep his way pure by guarding it according to your word, God's word as the ultimate answer and defense against every temptation. putting God's Word into our hearts and minds is what we need to do, firsthand. The psalmist says, with my whole heart, I seek you, let me not wander from your commandments. Then he said in verse 11, I have stored up your word in my heart, I think that the King James version I have treasured your word in my heart that I might not sin against you. You want to win the battle with sin I do. The way that we do that is storing up God's Word in our hearts and minds. And and I still do some things in old fashioned way. Sometimes take a scripture and put it on an index index card, and I just read it. And maybe visualize this is one of my motivations. Second Timothy chapter two, this one I picked the Brandley verses eight through 10. Remember Jesus Christ raised from the dead descended from David. This is my gospel for which I am suffering, even to the point of being chained like a criminal, but God's word is not chained. Therefore, I endure everything for the sake of the elect, that they too may obtain the salvation that is in Christ Jesus with eternal glory. This is the NIV sometimes the words will take on new meaning. But this will we're talking about taking God's word, storing it, treasuring it in our hearts above everything else in our culture, in our activities. And when I look over my life, there have been times in my life when I have struggled and stumbled and given to sin, or some temptation. And when that happens, I know why that takes place, is because I have not had God's word stored in my heart is as deeply as it should have been. I think that's true for all of us when we stumble, when we give it the sin, or whatever it may be, it's because God's word isn't impressed into our hearts. And we need to be doing that. On a regular basis. God, God wants us especially we will be pummeled children in just a moment. But the first thing my first responsibility as an individual, as a Christian, as a husband, as a father, or appreciate the first obligation is for me to take God's word and stamp it in my heart before I can teach that to anybody else. And that's what he's saying here. And Deuteronomy chapter six, to take that into impressed that into my heart and mind to wrap scripture around our hearts and minds. So when Jesus faced intent, temptation, read about Matthew chapter four, we're not going to read through this this morning. But in Matthew chapter four, when Satan tempted Jesus on this particular occasion, with real temptations and easy way out, escaping out of the cross, every time Jesus was tempted with scripture, he responded with tempted by Satan, he responded with scripture. This is an example for us. This is a, a pattern for us to follow. So again, when you look at the word of God, and the third point that I'm making from this text is that, yes, there is one God, we need to love Him with every fiber of our being. But at the end of the day, in the conclusion of worship, and everything else, you we each take God's word, and we press that, we forced that into our hearts and mind. Now, like this passage in Joshua, chapter eight. So again, this is the point of the Israelites taking possession of the land, and Joshua is encouraging them to be faithful to their God. It says in verse 34, that afterward he read all the words of the law, the blessing and the curse, according to all that is written in the book of the law. And look at verse 35.

Mike Roy  18:54
It says, Joshua is speaking to the people of Israel, there was not a word of all that Moses commanded that Joshua did not read before all the assembly of Israel, and the women and the little ones, and the sojourners who lived among them. You know what Joshua was doing over here. Joshua was impressing scripture into the hearts and minds of God's people. And so it's impressive to me, this not just for the adults is for everybody. And so we recognize when we look at the scriptures in this text, and in Deuteronomy, chapter six, one of the things that we need to do is impress God's Word into our hearts minds. So let's go back to the text this morning. And just couple other things that we want to say this morning. In verse seven, following the statement of verse six, that these words that I command you today shall be on your heart. Then in verse seven, he says, You shall teach them diligently to your children, and shall talk to them when you sit in your house, and when you walk by the way, and when you lie down, and when you rise, and so, again, go God is teaching his people through Moses, the importance, the importance of putting God's Word into our hearts and minds, not just of ourselves, but also of our children. And, and that's something let me see if I get up there in just a moment. And I, the point I'm making here is that this divine command is in connection with the fact that there is only one God. And we are to love him with all of our hearts, mind, soul, and strength. So, if we want our children to do well, on life, we understand that that's true for all of us. But more than anything, we want to save our children's souls, we want to lead them in holiness and faithfulness to God. And we do that not by telling them God's word, or showing that to them, but by by our example. And we can set that that priority priority with them and, and so this verse reminds us when we diligently teach our children, that means that we've got to give our children a higher priority than sometimes that we do. And that means in our mass, media, culture, and computers, all that that type of thing, sometimes we have to turn off the TV. It's an old message nice. Because priestess years ago in Alabama, it's still true. Sometimes you have to turn off a television, there's more to life than soccer, or making money or cooking. Today in our country is turned on PBS 1000 cooking shows, Jesus said, Man shall not live by bread, alone, but by every word that falls from the lips of God, the mouth of God. So turning off the television, turning off our computer, computers can be very helpful. But they can also be a source of great temptation. And we need to understand in this context that we ended, we want to diligently teach our children, everything about God in His ways. And I think it also means that giving our children are making their spiritual growth, a higher priority than academic achievement, and college or athletic excellence. We all want to win races and all that type of thing. But But grounding them in God's Word in the truth is really the challenge that that we need to rise up to. So

Mike Roy  22:14
the the message from this passage and do not my chapter six, is that we diligently teach our children. Other translations, I think, think they are sometimes helpful. This is the NIV in verse seven, impress them on your children, are we impressing God's holiness on our children, His love, His mercy, His character, His grace, all of that type of thing. And when you look at the, we'll go ahead and take these passages together. And this is the NIV. And so he says, talk about them when you sit at home, which when you sit at home, when you walk along the road, when you lie down, and when you get up, tie them as symbols on your hands and bind them on your foreheads. That's the frontlets there, write them on the doorframes of your houses, and on your gates. And so it's a reminder that we need to take every waking moment to impress God's words, on the hearts and minds of our children. And, and I am thinking in terms of these opportunities, that means that when you're driving your car walking down the street, that we need to take advantage of those opportunities. And, and maybe, sometimes we get into car we want to, sometimes we might want to preach to our children. But since we got a captive audience, I think that the challenge there is we have those private moments to share your personal convictions and God tell them what God means to you, in your in your own life. And I want to say this, some preaching, sometimes we, we recognize our failures, and our inadequacies, and none of us are perfect in raising children. And when I was began preaching in North Alabama, for almost 35 years ago, whenever that was Carol would remind me when I do lessons on raising children before our kids were born, said, Listen, we don't have any kids yet. So you know, be careful what you say, Well, that's true. But the reality is God has given us a standard. And we can follow that standard. And even though we all fail, in various ways, and as parents, but we need to be determined to do our best so that we can ground our children in the truth and a point I'm really trying to make this morning is I see young families here at Broadmoor and hearing stories of activities in your house while you're having the children in the house you the Bible is being played on some digital device or sometimes take post it notes and put them all over the house. You know, the real adversary is the devil, not us, you know, all types of things, little reminders that we need those types of reminders. And the last verse over here, write them on the doorframes of your houses on negation. Many of you have scripture over the entry to a room in your house. It's wonderful. And that's what what God is telling his people to do through Moses. So we recognize them, especially, this is a day that's been set aside to acknowledge the role of fathers. This is our great responsibility that we have a great opportunity to teach and train our children, to love God to serve God and to do His will. Let me just review this morning before we wrap up the lesson this morning. So from this text this morning, and Deuteronomy, chapter six, verses four through nine, you're gonna say that Moses affirms unequivocally that there is only one God. Secondly, we must love God with every ounce of strength that we have with every fiber of our being. We don't just say that. But we have to do that. Thirdly, we saw that God commands us to impress scripture into our hearts and minds, we do that first for ourselves. And then we must diligently teach God's word to our children. And then basically, and one of the messages that comes from this text is that God's word must so permeate our lives, and the lives of our children. It affects everything that we do, say and think. And that's the message that, that Moses is giving to these people, as they prepare to, to go into the Promised Land. And so this morning, as we prepare to sing the invitation song, we ask ourselves that question, am I impressing scripture, into my heart, in my mind, in my soul, we recognize that there is only one God right? And because there is only one God, what Moses tells us to do, is that we need to love Him, serve Him and obey Him with with all of our heart, mind, soul and strength. And that's manifested through some type of obedience to become a Christian. And maybe there's someone here this morning who hasn't obeyed the gospel of Christ, to tell you how you become a Christian according to the Word of God, you believe that Jesus is the Messiah, you must be willing to repent of your sins, that confession of faith in him before others, and then you must submit the God's commands to be immersed in water. At that point, your sins are washed away. If

Mike Roy  27:11
you haven't done that, we urge you to do that. Or if you just need the President's congregation, did you face challenges and struggles we invite you to come while we stand in saying this invitation song.
