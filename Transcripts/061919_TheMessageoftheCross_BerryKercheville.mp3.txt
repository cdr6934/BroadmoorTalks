Unknown Speaker  00:00
I don't think I can speak without some wire around me. That's weird. Nice to see you all, it's such a pleasure to always be with you. So many of you I know. And that's always special be able to see you even though we're just across town from each other, I

Unknown Speaker  00:19
don't run into you a lot. So that's always nice. And it's just nice that we're brethren together. And I love that part, especially when, when we take the Lord's supper together. And you're like me, they're different things that you might concentrate on each week. Sometimes I'm reading and thinking about the resurrection. And I love to read John 20. Or maybe I'm reading about the two on the road to Emmaus. And then discovering that they're actually talking to Jesus and the great sermon that he would have preached that day, taking the prophets and showing everything that had been spoken about him. And then there's obviously times when we read about the crucifixion itself. And if you're like me, I try to see it, I try to visualize it in my mind. And it's, it's just not 3d, if you will, it's just not something that is easy to do. Maybe we've seen it in movies, maybe a little bit or, or we try to visualize what's what's happening. But it's, it's not very real to us, because it isn't part of our culture or society. And it's just so far away that there's a lot of it that I think is dialed down for us. And can you imagine someone being able, or maybe just God, being able to just take us and say, I want you to go back, I'm gonna, I'm gonna take you back time, machine wise, I'm gonna take you back to 33 a day. And I want you to watch from the moment Jesus is arrested in the garden. Until and through the crucifixion, I want you to be there. I want you to see what others saw. I want you to see what the disciples saw. I want you to see what the multitudes in the crowd saw. And when you begin to picture that all of a sudden, I'm, I'm thinking, no, no, I'm not sure I want to do that. But you can imagine watching this take place, it's not a somber moment. It's a pretty raucous crowd. Everybody is shouting and screaming and mocking and scoffing and, and you watch these men get nailed to a cross, and then lifted up.

Unknown Speaker  03:11
And the Lord says, sit down and watch. Minutes seem like hours. It is unimaginable to think of just even six hours. And you watch these men on the cross, writhing in agony.

Unknown Speaker  03:37
And except for the few believers are there and some of the women in the distance. Not many people really care. It's nuts another day, in the life of the Roman Empire. Within a few minutes, you want to leave, you don't want to see it. But you're forced to stay. You have to keep watching. After a few hours, you begin to beg God to let him die. You can't believe what he's going. And we look at that. And obviously, we say truthfully, and certainly so that he did that for our sins.

Unknown Speaker  04:25
And that is, of course, so special, unimaginably special. But one of the things that we miss, and why

Unknown Speaker  04:37
is there something beyond that? Jesus didn't die on a cross simply to forgive us of our sins. He died on a cross to send us a message. Paul refers to it that way. First Corinthians chapter one. You'll notice in your Bibles in First Corinthians one and verse 17. We see those very words by Paul. He says, For Christ did not send me to baptize, but to preach the gospel not with words of eloquent wisdom, less the cross of Christ be emptied of its power. For the word of the cross, and some of the older versions use the word message, for the message of the cross is folly to those who are perishing, but to us who are being saved. It is the power of God. Where it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise in the discernment of the discerning eye will court. Where is the one who is wise? Where is the scribe? Where's the debater of this age? Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world for since the wisdom in the wisdom of God, the world did not know God through wisdom it please God through the folly of what we preach, to save those who believe. Now, you might immediately think Well, certainly to the world, and this is something Paul emphasizes to the world, a savior on a cross is absolute foolishness. It's absolutely, it's just falling. But there is still more to it than that. Because when he talks about presenting this, he actually says you can empty when you teach this, you can teach it in such a way to empty the power of the cross. And then should let you start a lesson. Am I when I would maybe share the gospel with somebody or talk to somebody would I do so in such a way to empty the power of the cross? Empty the power from the message itself. As a matter of fact, we see that very thing, in happening and Coren that the preachers they've hired, if you will, the preachers who are making money off of them are going about preaching in such a way that this is what Paul is saying, These men are teaching in such a way as to empty the power of the message. They're emptying the power of the cross. And that's what we wanted to explore this evening. Because it is a fascinating picture and thread that Paul follows through First and Second Corinthians that is so easily missed. There is something that we do if we do it incorrectly, in which we will destroy the message even though we believe in Jesus. And even though we believe He died on the cross, we can take that very message and empty it of its power. How would that happen? What does that really mean? Let me suggest a few things. First off, let's start with some basics here we often oversimplify the message of the crops, we just do not think of it exactly the same way we ought to. In other words, if someone asked us what's the message of the cross, I'm sure you'd be like me, the first thought is to say, well, the message of the crosses, he died so that we didn't have to live without God forever. And he he sacrificed for our sins. He was a ransom price for our sins, He paid the highest price, he could pay his own life, we would talk about all those things, obviously. But there is more to it than that. And this is what Paul's message is, for example, when you think about just the cross itself consider Jesus could have died hundreds of different ways. If if you want to give me a choice, there's a lot of choices I can have other than a cross. What about you? Yeah, I vote for just about anything, not the cross. How about Give me that. You know, like, Socrates, give me the little vial of hemlock. Let me drink. I was reading about that. A while back. His friend came in and handed him the vial in the room where he is and said Just drink it and walk around the room a little while. And when you feel your legs getting heavy, just lay down and you'll gradually everything I'll just get numb and you go to sleep. It'll be fine.

Unknown Speaker  09:36
I'm thinking cool. What's wrong with that? That's okay. How about Stoney? Yeah, y'all think stoning over that, you know one good whack to your head and you know it's done. Did you choose love to stone? So couldn't we have chosen Stoney? No. The Lord chooses the crooks And he makes a big deal out of it, doesn't it? He makes a big deal out of it even beyond himself, he makes a big deal out of it, even concerning disciples. And that's what's interesting. So when Paul talks about life in Christ, he says in Galatians, 220, I am crucified with Christ. He doesn't just say, I died. I am crucified with Christ, he uses that word that would bring to our minds, something far more than just laying down and going to sleep and die. That's how Paul spoke of the way he lived. And no surprise, you remember over in Matthew chapter 16, verse 21, to 25. Remember that great scene in which Jesus finally tells the apostles, we're going to Jerusalem, I'm going to be arrested. They're going to take me and they're going to try me, and they're going to kill me. And after three days, I will raise it. And of course, the the apostles never heard the raise up. That was always like, they were really shocked about the diaper. That no Jew ever dreamed that a messiah would die. So they're shocked about the die part. And they don't even hear the raised part. When they do hear the raised part. They just look at each other. What is that? I don't know what that means. So here is you're gonna die. And of course, what's Peter did right after Peter had proclaimed Him to be the Christ, the Son of God, you're it. You're the you're the Holy One of Israel, you're everything. He takes him aside, and begins to tell him exactly how it's supposed to be. And we chuckle at that, and go, Yeah, good job beat. What in the world is in your mind? You just called him God? And now you're correcting him? Jesus answer is really amazing. Because what Jesus says is, look, you're doing things for you, and what humans want. And I'm doing what God wants, and then calls everybody around him and says, If anyone will follow me, let him deny himself and take up his you all know it. crops. What? Yes, Jesus is clearly pointing out, hey, there is no such thing as a messiah, without the cross. And there is no such thing as the disciple of a messiah without the cross. One of the really unique things about the book of Isaiah, is that you begin to discover as you're reading all the prophecies about the coming Messiah, especially in chapter 40, through 66, and you're reading all these prophecies, and suddenly you begin to understand about halfway through that, that he has transitioned from talking about the Messiah, his work, and also matching that with the disciples of the Messiah, the offspring of the Messiah, and how they will do everything the Messiah does. Watch for that sometime when you read Isaiah. Nothing that the Messiah does, isn't matched by the disciple. Every disciple does exactly what is Master does. You say, whoa, whoa, whoa, not Isaiah 53. You know, the famous suffering serpent song? He's not talking about us doing that? Yes, he is. If you don't deny yourself and take up your cross, you cannot be my disciple. We match it in every way. Everything the Messiah does, we are called to do. And Isaiah 49. Paul, Paul actually quotes Isaiah 49 Verse six, where it says that Jesus would be made a light to the world to bring salvation at the end of the earth. And Paul turns around and quotes that next 13 He says, yep, that's what God has commanded us to do. You got what commanded us? In context, that was just the Messiah. No, Paul does everything the Messiah does we do.

Unknown Speaker  14:27
And you see, keep seeing that. So the message of the cross, the picture of seeing this one on the cross, is not just He forgave our sins, but He chose a death to show us how we are to live. Where to live out that very message so many present to you two ways that the cross is emptied of its power. First, obviously in our text, Paul points out that it is emptied by the way it is present did and that's exactly what the Corinthian false teachers do. As a matter of fact, you would notice most of First Corinthians and sprinkled into Second Corinthians mention of the way they were emptying the cross by the message that changed it in verse ways, they tweaked it in various ways. And we'll look into how that how that looks in just a second. But the way they presented it was very critical. And you see this even in our text right here. When he says in verse 17, of First Corinthians one, Christ did not send me to baptize, but to preach the gospel, not with words of eloquent wisdom. Otherwise, it loses its power. So how I'm going to say this, how I'm going to speak this is going to be very, very critical to whether or not I'm emptying its power. So have you ever done this? I, I have, in my early years, in my zeal to get somebody to become a Christian, you get to talk to me, oh, you know, if you become a Christian and make you a better mom, or dad, it'll make you a better worker, you know, you're cataloging them a better life, you're just all again, you know, you You're such a good person anyway, there will be a whole lot of things you have to change or, or give up, you just fit right in to Christianity, blah, blah, blah, a bunch

Unknown Speaker  16:28
of junk. No, that's not how it is. That's not how it is. You don't become a Christian, guys, it's gonna make you a better mom or dad.

Unknown Speaker  16:48
And let me take, you don't change a little bit. You die. You don't. And there's not a person, not a good person, not a great person, not a wonderful person in the world. That isn't jump without Jesus Christ. That's all there is to it. And we cannot preach that message. But this is the kind of message that was obviously going on at Corinth because of the way you see Paul talking about that message and how the Corinthians were learning to live soft, it was a soft light. It was a life in which there was not much sacrifice to it nor expected, and certainly not in the teachers, the chapter two, but first Corinthians one through five, notice the words and when I came to your brothers, he's showing the contrast with how he taught, I did not come proclaiming to you the testimony of God with lofty speech or wisdom and impress you with my great oratory. I decided to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ and crucified. In other words, everything I taught, everything I gave you, was woven around the principle of the message of He's crucified, you're crucified. And I was with you, verse three, in weakness, and in fear and much trembling in my speech. And notice this and my message. Were not implausible words of wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and power, then your faith might not rest in the wisdom of men, but in the power of God didn't want you to have faith based on you're really wowed by how I could turn a word, and how I could show the fanciness of what it meant to be a grid. He says, I just gave it to you straight. In fact, in chapter two and verse 13, so much so Paul makes the argument, we use this verse for verbal inspiration. That's not its original intent. He's using this to say, look, we didn't even use our own words. We were so intent on you seeing God in the way God revealed God, that we didn't even use our own words, we use just the words of the Holy Spirit, which isn't great instruction to us that as we teach, as we preach, as we go about relating the gospel of Christ, that we tried to do it in the way the Holy Spirit revealed it because he artistically put this together in just the perfect way. So that it touch the thoughts and intents of our hearts. And when we mess with that, chop it up like fast food, miss the content, miss the message, do not see how the Holy Spirit put it together, we lose the power of this. It's a great warning. I mean, we all every preacher should preach topical sermons. There's topics to be talked about. But that is not the major way the gospel should be taught. That is not the major way any of this be taught. The Holy Spirit put this all together 66 Great Books I would picture as 66 jigsaw puzzles put all together in a giant jigsaw puzzle that gives us a perfect picture of God and Jesus

Unknown Speaker  20:25
and why? So that I can truly see him? To know him so that I can love him. Okay cannot love somebody you do not know. Now, where are the holes in your jigsaw puzzle? We all have hopes. Some of us have giant holes of a giant holes in my passport.

Unknown Speaker  20:54
How about the prophets? Is that a giant hole in your puzzle? Sure, how about Chronicles? Why? Why would I read Chronicles already had kings written to different people for a different purpose with a different message during a different part of God's picture.

Unknown Speaker  21:13
With every hole that I have, in my jigsaw puzzle, I have an imperfect picture of God. And with an imperfect picture of God, I fall in love with a God that does not exist. It is important that I truly see him and every part of Scripture shows a different angle of the manifold wisdom of God. And the Holy Spirit is put that together in a unique way. Paul even tells Timothy in Second Timothy three and verse 14, and 15. To continue. That's the words you use, continue talking to a Christian continue in the sacred scriptures Old Testament. Because they will make you quote wise unto salvation through faith in Christ Jesus. You had asked me years ago now what part of the Bible make you wise unto salvation through faith in Christ, he says, New Testament, and vases are the oldest. Some of us are older can remember when folks used to say, well, in a while we read the Old Testament, we're not under it. We chuckle at that now. But how sad to miss the ability to see so much of the picture of God and have a hole in our jigsaw. So this is the way the cross gets emptied, is it gets empty by how it is presented. And it's extremely dangerous just considered these words. In John chapter six, most of you know about this text. But you remember, the Jesus has fed the 5000 the day before. And now he the next day, they come for breakfast, and he's like, nanananana, you didn't see the sign you'd understand. I'm the bread of life that has come down to heaven. And they're murmuring and grumbling about him and he finally just looks at

Unknown Speaker  23:21
him and goes, Look, you thank you grumbling about that. If you don't eat my flesh and drink my blood, you have no lifing.

Unknown Speaker  23:28
They understood exist, you know, at first you kind of think, well, they probably didn't hurt somebody. So no, there's always understood that life is in him. And in order to live, you have to take him and consume it. Dieticians nowadays will say you are who you eat, where you are that way too, with what you eat spiritually. You become what you ingest. And Jesus is saying you have to take it all in. He's not talking about the Lord's Supper. He's talking about a life that is consuming the way he is and the way you live. And anything short of that he says you don't have life. And anything short of that is empty. The cross its power. One of the things that I've been fearful of and I know this is being corrected in a lot of places glad I think it is here sir.

Unknown Speaker  24:33
But you know our heritage has been to battle. Bots teach needed to be battle. Started battling back in the early 1800s. battle battle battle battle, every new false doctrine came up battle battle. We'd gird our loins. We got to the point we forgot. Living as a Christian is more than battling. In fact, more important is to be recreated in the image of Christ. And there's only one way that happens. You cannot study the Bible to discover what's the right side of an issue.

Unknown Speaker  25:20
And we Christ, it just doesn't work that way. You don't study the Bible to find out what's moral and immoral. And somehow that's going to make you Christ like, it just didn't work. We have to get back to understand, yes, there's a time, obviously, to teach against those things that are bought. But that's the first principles. It's not moving on. To that which actually creates us in the image of God. Second Corinthians 318, to be able to look unveiled Into His Glory and be transformed from one image to another.

Unknown Speaker  26:03
That's the goal. At my age, I have become Yeah, hit this point, you know, just a few of us here understand this. But you hit this point where you go,

Unknown Speaker  26:20
Dude, I just got a little while left. This, and then and then it's like frustration? Ah, wait a minute. I got so much more to study. I'm not quite ready yet. I'm not there yet. I want more time. Not more time, because I want to see my wife and my grandkids and all those kinds of things. Yes, that's nice. I wanted more time, because there's so much more that I need to learn and reflect and change to be like him, because there's parts of me that I'll be embarrassed. Because I haven't quite got it yet. And I know, as Paul said, haven't rapper handed but I keep pressing. I know, I know. I'm sure will feel that way to the day we take our last breath. But it's still frustrating. We don't want to empty the message of its power. Do you know, even this message is seen in our baptism? I did this is where we need to be careful about what we say to children about baptism, because they're ready to do it. Too young. Because they're just thinking in terms of Whoo, man, you know, I get scared at night, but I might, you know, not be saved. So let me be baptized just because I'm scared of fire. And appropriate that baptismal death, is sending a message. It's a message of commitment that my life is crucified. That's not a kid thought. That's not a concept that children understand as a concept that adults can understand. And it's very picturesque. And we need to remember the picture that is there. Not simply, the reason that we do it, there's a second way that we empty the cross of the power, and that's the way we live it. And this is a critical part of the thread that goes through First and Second Corinthians that I think is often missed. He actually starts this in first Corinthians chapter four. And I'm gonna, we're just gonna take a little journey here for about four, four main texts, or so we take a little journey. And I want you to see this, how Paul uses this. And he starts in in First Corinthians goes off, and we usually look at first grades and we go, Oh, you're talking about all these doctrinal issues and stuff? Yes, but there's an underlying pattern. There's an underlying theme here, that he starts in First Corinthians and picks up in Second Corinthians, and it's about the things that he and the others with him go through to illustrate and this is critical, to illustrate what it means to actually live the cross and not empty it of its power. So in First Corinthians chapter four, notice his words beginning there in verse eight. Paul says to the Corinthians already need a lot of irony here already, you have all you want. Already you have become rich. Without us, you have become kings, and wood that you did rain so that we might share the rule with you. For I think God has exhibited us apostles as last of all like men sentenced to death, because we have become a spectacle to the world to angels and to men. We are fools for Christ's sake, but you are wise in Christ. We are weak but you You are strong, you are held in honor but we in distribute to the present our we hunger and thirst. We are poorly dressed and buffeted and homeless. And we labor working with our own hands. When reviled, we bless when persecuted we endure, when slandered we intreat we have become and are still like the scum of the world, the refuse of all things. To notice these words, I do not write these things to make you ashamed, but to admonish you as my beloved brethren. Paul, you most certainly wrote those to make them ashamed. You can't be not ashamed breeding that his point is, I didn't primarily write it. So not but state and in primarily write it. So do you be ashamed, I primarily wrote it to admonish you about how you're looking at your Christian life. You just live in a soft life, and you think it's all about sitting back. And here we are out here. We're the scum of the world, presenting the cross of Christ. But notice the next thing for though you have countless guides in Christ, you do not have many fathers, for I became your father in Christ, you just do the gospel. What is his point there? His point is, children act like their father, I had become your father, you may have guides, you may have teachers, you have a father, I have become your father, I have shown you the way you need to live. And when you see how me and those with me are living, you need to understand this isn't soft. We come to Christ carrying across.

Unknown Speaker  31:49
So he is really trying to get them to see this. And then verse 16, these crazy this crazy, amazing sentence. I urge you then be imitators of me. Oh, my, how many years I read those little words out of their context, because they were so perfect. To just tell somebody you know, whatever doctrinal things, you see Paul teaching, he's telling you to imitate that object, Lord, sup? How to withdraw from somebody how not to have a division that your child edited. That's not the context. Context is we die. You imitate me. You imitate what it means to carry the cross of Christ. You show the message, and have you live. Take a look over in Second Corinthians. And you will notice Paul, following up on this very principle in a number of the Texas secondaries won't even have time to look at all of them. But look at chapter two and verse 14. And Paul continues this thought, he says But thanks be to God who in Christ always leads us in triumphal procession and through us spreads the fragrance of the knowledge of him everywhere now. That's ESB rendering and it's a little ambiguous there. I want you to hear the NIV rendering of this. He says who always leads us as captives in Christ triumphal procession. NLT puts it very plainly, but thank God He has made us his captives, and continues to lead us along in Christ triumphal procession. Now He uses us to spread the knowledge of Christ everywhere like sweet perfume. This is a picture of a Roman commander or king going out and conquering another country or city and taking the spoils and taking the captives of the city and taking all of those who are on the other side and taking them back to his home city and then marching them through the city in a great victorious triumphal procession. The priests of the gods would be in the streets offering incense to the gods for the victory and thanksgiving for the victory. You would have music and celebration as the captives would be led in this triumphal procession through the street. At the end of the procession, some of them would be chosen you see King David doing this on one of his tribal processions. Some would be chosen to be killed in all out of the gate. The apostle Paul says, Thanks be to God, that He has made us his captives in his triumphal procession. And as we marched toward death, the world smells the fragrance that comes from what we live and how we live. And the gospel is spread through us through the life we live.

Unknown Speaker  35:34
ever seeing yourself as a cat, in Christ's triumphal procession, being led, what an honor that he took us kept being led before the world as a spectacle to the world.

Unknown Speaker  35:53
But as those who buy our lives, just like that incense, spread the fragrance of him every person, the fragrance is a fragrance of life to life. They see that that's what they have to be like brothers, the fragrances death to death, they will in no way give their lives up to death in order to escape your cap in Christ's pride, triumphal procession. Be imitators of me. Looking at the next text and chapter four and verse seven, he again gives such a list. He says in verse seven referring to the gospel message is is but we have this treasure, in jars of clay, to show that there's surpassing power belongs to God and not us. We are afflicted in every way. This is like a broken record. This is like deja vu all over again. We're afflicted in every way not by not crushed, perplexed, but not driven to despair persecuted, but not forsaken struck down but not destroyed. Always carrying in the body the death of Jesus. So the life of Jesus may also be manifested in our bodies. I don't know why our translations continue to use manifest. Never use that word never except you're reading the Bible. So the word in the air NRSV is visible. Look at that. Look at that we who live are always been given over to we live are always carrying in the body, the death of Jesus or the life of Jesus may be made visible in our bodies. For we who live are always being given over to death for Jesus sake. So the life of Jesus also may be visible in our mortal flesh. So death is at work in us but life in you How is Christ visible in your leg? You ever hear preachers say I know Yeah, I have to give me a break. Just I know people ought to know that you're a Christian. And my thought is well, I guess they supposed to know it because I don't custom to tabacky or something like that. I don't know. No, I don't think that's the way they're going to know. You're gonna have to get to know it. Because you die. Because you lay your life down. You lay their life down for their souls. You are a captain in Christ, triumphal procession. And the fragrance of your life as a captain is spread everywhere. That's the picture. And then Paul refers to them as jars of clay in which this great treasure is in. In ancient days, valuable treasure Razi put in plain clay jars, you know, you know how junk that is? When they excavate someplace where did they find piles of broken pottery? Because it just they broke all the time. And Paul says, that's what we're carrying around. We, all of us, we and they, and yes, the inspired man carried it in a little different way than we do but we carry it as in jars of clay.

Unknown Speaker  39:19
Why do you call it a jar clay because we're nothing. break us. And the treasure is see how we broken he described, carrying in the body the death of Jesus, he described afflicted in every way but not crushed, perplexed, but not given despair, persecuted but not forsaken struck down but not destroyed.

Unknown Speaker  39:45
We're willing to have our lives broken, so that the treasure can be seen. Have you ever said, Well, you know, people talk about evangelism are just not good at Had I tried that and I'm no good at UCR you just think an epic wrong. You're thinking of it like knocking on a door or you're thinking of it like, I gotta have just the right words. You're thinking of it like when Moses was told to go deliver Israel out of Egypt. And Moses said, I can't do it. I can't talk. I can't, I can't, I can't. And God said, actually, that's the perfect guy there. 40 years ago, you thought you could and you were not the perfect guy. But when you think you can't, now you'll know I'm the one

Unknown Speaker  40:33
doing it. In sending a band of angels, we're perfect. Because we're just junk. We're just junky play clay jars. We don't say it right? We don't say, I'm scared. You're scared. We're all scared. But I was scared when I asked Teresa to marry me. And she said I blathered on for almost an hour.

Unknown Speaker  41:01
I don't remember what I said. I know it was pretty awful. But I had to get it out. She said yes. Wow. Love will cause you to do a lot of things, even when

Unknown Speaker  41:19
it's not presented well. Your clay chalk purposely made to be broken, so the treasure can be seen. Look at chapter five, verse 11. Paul says, Therefore knowing that the knowing the fear of the Lord, we persuade others, but what we are known, what we are is known to God and I hope it is known also to your conscience. We are not commending ourselves to you again, but giving you a cause to boast about us. So that you may be able to answer those who boast about outward appearance. Now you can see the way these preachers according to word, and not about what is in the heart, for if we are beside ourselves. It's not for God, it is for God. And if we are out of our mind, it is for you. I wouldn't like you just stop and notice that right there. Paul is so nuts. When the Corinthian teachers look at him, they go, that's crazy. What's crazy, the way he lives, his life. How he suffers how he lays his life down so others can live how he gives himself please God, that's nuts. That's foolishness. the foolishness of the cross is being illustrated by Paul and those with him and how they live. And he says, That's just crazy. Absolutely crazy. And so what do you see there in the text? If we're beside ourselves, well, it's over God. In verse 14, for the love of Christ, this is what controls us constrains us, the love of Christ controls us, because we have concluded this, no one has died for all, therefore all have died. And he died for all that those who live might no longer live for themselves. But for him, who for their sake, died and was raised if there was any question as to whether Paul when he talked about giving ourselves up being jars of clay or being captives in the triumph of possession, if there's any doubt that he was referring to every Christian and not just himself right here, he takes all that away by simply saying he died for all that those who live might no longer live for themselves. That's exactly right. And therefore, he said, from now on in verse 16, we regard no one according to flesh, even though we once regarded Christ according to flesh. We regard him thus no longer Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he's a new creation. We always read verse 17, I've done it, you've done it. Yeah, put that out. When you're baptized, let's sing, you know, we're a new creation. It's not exactly the context. Paul is saying look, because he died, therefore, we die. Therefore, from now on, we do not see people according to the flesh, that is the we do not look at them from a fleshly perspective anymore. If I could ever get that really, in my mind, it would help me a lot. Because if you're like me, you see somebody even though you don't know them, you just observe them and you make snap judgments. Appearance talk, what they have in your shopping cart, whatever, just snap judgments. And he says we don't perceive anybody according to flesh anymore. We don't judge them that way. We see them from a spiritual point of view, and we die for we're a new creation in Christ. We look at everything differently now. Final text here chapter six verse three. Have you noticed that again, but we put no obstacle in anyone's way so that no fault may be found with our ministry. But as servants of God we commend ourselves in every way by great endurance and afflictions, hardships, calamities, beatings, imprisonments, riots, labors, sleepless nights hunger, by purity, knowledge, patience, kindness, the Holy Spirit, genuine love by truthful speech, and the power of God with the weapons of righteousness for the right hand. And for the left, though, through honor and dishonor, through slander and praise, we are treated as imposters, and yet true as unknown, and yet well known as dying and behold, we live as punished and yet not killed as sorrowful, yet always rejoicing, as poor yet making many rich as having nothing yet possessing everything. We have spoken freely to you, Corinthians, our heart is wide open. You're not restricted by us, but you are restricted in your own

Unknown Speaker  46:18
affections your own less. You know, what's holding you back, Corinthians. It isn't anything we did. We showed you the way. What's keeping you as back in chapter 520? He said, what's keeping you from being reconciled to God? Yeah, you've been baptized, you're not reconciled to God. And the reason you're not reconciled because you're not living the way God called you.

Unknown Speaker  46:46
And he shows it again in another list. And says, you know, what's holding you back? Your desires. That's what holds me back. That's what holds you back.

Unknown Speaker  46:59
I like my company. Sacrifices hard. Getting out of my comfort zone is not easy. Kept carrying in the body, the death of Jesus the life of Jesus might be, we could also follow up with chapter 12. Remember that long list Paul gives again, but all the things he's going through? Why would he boast about that? Why would he boast about his weakness? The answer is clearly because that's how Christ lips. That's how a disciple of Christ lips. Here's the Corinthian preachers boasting about don't we look great? Isn't our speech wonderful? You know, Paul's kinda ugly. And Paul goes, Okay, you want to boast, this is really dumb, but let me boast. And he talks about all the horrible things that happens to he's not talking about that to say, what we're looking at me how bad it is. He's saying. This is what a disciple of Christ looks like. We've had a mistaken idea that second Corinthians about a defense of Paul Paul actually says in chapter 12 And verse 19, I am not been giving a defense of myself. I am not giving a defense of myself, I am showing you what a disciple of Christ looks like. What a powerful message. So three things. The message of the cross is a picture of disciples who give themselves over to death.

Unknown Speaker  48:43
So others can. It is interesting. One of our major mistakes is to lob verse grenades at people and think that somehow is going to draw them to Christ.

Unknown Speaker  49:05
It will not. What draws them to Christ is the pure gospel carried in a container that is willing to be broke. For many people to be taught, it can take hundreds of hours of you giving your life and investing your life in them getting close enough to them, so the salt actually flavors the object. Our salt shakers are in the cupboard and they're not out. We need to touch the salt to give it the flavor. There's only one way the gospel is taught. And that's by carrying in the body The death of Jesus so his life can be seen. Secondly, it's really only by living the message that the power of the message actually has its effect is in Corinthians three Paul even say you are a letter from Christ. Written on your hearts. Jesus has come and he is scrolled on your hearts changing you to reflect His glory. You carry the message, but you have to reflect the message. And you don't reflect it just because you're a good guy. You're reflected again, because you'll actually lay your life down for someone. Now, here's the real message. Becoming a Christian will ruin your life. It's a great ruin. But it will ruin your life, because it'll be no longer you who live but the crucified Christ living in you. Take up your take up your victory, and walk through the streets as a captive in Christ's triumphal procession. Take the jar of clay that you have and carry the treasure and break the jar open. The treasure can be seen. Truly lay your life down so others can laugh. That's what our calling is. And I think we're all fearful. Hopefully we're all fearful that we lose that calling that we lose that identity or across the nation. We see churches living simply for themselves. We cannot live that way. We're born to be broken. Born to show the great treasure. We're gonna sing a song and if there's any way we can help you and your search for the Lord, be glad to to do so. Just please step forward. Let your wishes be known. Well together we stand with what we say
