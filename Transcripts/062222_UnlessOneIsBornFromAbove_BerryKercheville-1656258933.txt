All right pleasure to be with you. It's been a while, we had some kind of weird disease that went through everywhere and I didn't get sick. So nice to be back with you always pleasure to renew some acquaintances, people I don't see very often, and really enjoy coming and being with you. If you open your Bibles to John, chapter two, John, chapter two will be where our study will begin. And, as you can see, we are going to look at this part of John on unless you are born from above. I have to say, in introducing this, I think that a lot of times we have not given this text the attention that it really deserves. Maybe we have gone over it and took took just a quick view and, and said, Well, you know, born of water, that's baptism born of the Spirit. Well, that's something I don't know, but who cares. And, and, you know, I don't want to worry about that one. And we just go on. And yet, this is a very, very significant part and beginning and opening, opening up the theme, actually, to the Gospel, as John is early on in his letter, and he gives us some information that I, I really believe has been neglected over the years. And I hope that we can get that that message to us tonight, it'll be something that I know, if you're like me, you will have to chew on it a while I've spent quite a while to in on this text. And there's just some really cool things that we can get out of the text. One of the things that you'll notice, as far as just the pattern that is taking place so far in John, is I'm sure most of you are aware, you know, John begins with the beginning.

Unknown Speaker  02:00
In the beginning was the Word and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. And we we all go, Man, that sounds like Genesis. And yes, it does. And in fact, there's a reason for that. Because just as in the book of Genesis, God is telling us about a creation. So John, in his Gospel is introducing to us a new creation. And we have all kinds of things that are popped up that are a new creation that are pictured after the creation of Genesis, you have new light, you have life that comes through Jesus, you have a picture of new wine, in chapter two, you have a picture of a new temple in chapter two, you have a kingdom that is different than the kingdom that we saw before. And if you have a new kingdom, and it is not likely Israel kingdom, then you also have to have a new birth. In order to be in that kingdom. Everything starts with these new bonuses, even at chapter four, you have new living water, and it keeps right on going and that as this creation, this spiritual creation that God wants in US begins to develop. I would like you to notice just beginning here in chapter two, verse 23, through 25, the setup for the conversation with Nicodemus, listen carefully now, when he was in Jerusalem at the Passover Feast, many believed in his name when they saw the signs that he was doing. But Jesus on his part did not entrust himself to them, because he knew all people that needed no one to bear witness about man, for he himself knew what was in man. So we're getting ready for the text here. Here's what we first need to understand. John is doing something he does the mathematically through the gospel, John is differentiating between disciples, there are disciples that are truly truly believers. In fact, Jesus even uses that phrase in John 831, and 32 of those who truly are His disciples, they abide in His Word. But there are those throughout the gospel, John, that are truly His disciples, we see people in Chapter 12 The priests to believe in him but will not confess his name. We see the same thing here in this, this introductory part where these are people who believe in the name of Jesus, they believe in His power, and yet, Jesus is not believing them. Take a look at how the Holman Christian Standard Bible translates that text. Many trusted his name, but he did not entrust himself to them. The same Greek word that many believed in Him as our but versus would say, but he did not believe in them. It's the same Greek word. And what is being said here is they may have believed in him, but Jesus knew they were not what a true disciple should be. We're not unaware of the idea of somebody being a believer, and yet not really a believer, somebody beings, who calls himself a disciple, but really not doing what a disciple ought to do. And that's the one of the things that we need to notice in this text. Furthermore, you will notice that when you're reading in the discussion with Nicodemus, here in chapter three, that Nicodemus then is an illustration of these people before Nicodemus is not a disciple. Yet, Nicodemus comes and he's interested, and he is a believer of sorts, but he is not a disciple. He's not in the kingdom. And Jesus makes that very, very clear to him. And when you see these words, born again, as Jesus uses in chapter three, verse three, Truly, truly I say to you, unless one is born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God. If you read the New Revised Standard, or the net virgins is actually born from above, the marginal ratings are some of the Bible's will say born from above. That is that the difficulty of translating is it means both. And the Greek it means born again and born from above, is a birth that comes through the power of God and not a birth that comes from the power or strength of humans. And by John introduces that for us, in John one and verse 13, where he actually says, that those who receive Him and are born and he says, not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, meaning the flesh doesn't have the power to accomplish this, nor have the will of man, nor you can't do it just because you want to, but of God, Peter would say in First Peter chapter one that you're born again, of an imperishable seed, it is it is a seed, unlike the fleshly human see, it's an imperishable seed. It's a seed that causes you to live and abide forever, as the word of God does, as the seed does, as opposed to the fleshly seed that does not abide forever. So you see the necessity of this rebirth. That's the key. As a matter of fact, in verse six of chapter three, Jesus actually says, to Nicodemus, that which is born of the flesh is flesh. In other words, that which is born of the flesh can do no more than to produce flesh, you can't get any more out of it. Therefore, what is necessary is that which is born to the Spirit is spirit. The only way to really be reborn is to be reborn of the Spirit and be the have the spirit in you being reborn, that's the only way this is going to happen. And that's the only way it's going to last throughout eternity. That's the idea we want you to notice to have this, the spirit equates with the power of rebirth, the flesh equates to weakness, and the lack of ability to be empowered, to be reborn. So it is not something that I can just say, I decide to be reborn, he actually says this has to come from God, this birth, this rebirth comes from the power of God and cannot be done by you or I or any other fleshly human being, we have the power that is limited that is simply the flesh. In fact, what this implies is a couple of really important things. The whole Jewish system then is superseded by a greater kingdom and a greater way of entering that kingdom. Now, if you would think for a minute the way Nicodemus would have looked at this,

Unknown Speaker  09:14
what's Nicodemus thinking? Well, Nicodemus has been circumcised, He keeps the law. He doesn't eat unclean foods. He observes the Sabbath. He keeps the various festivals, and if he is anything like the typical Pharisee, there's exceptions, but if he's like the typical Pharisee, or the typical Jew, he sees his connection to salvation, mainly as being a physical connection to Abraham. You see this primarily in the book of Galatians and Galatians. Paul attacks this, this that has been brought in to the Galatian brethren, that is not just Christ, you have to have you have to have Christ and the law And then Paul exposes that by showing them that even those of you who teach circumcision do not keep the law. Following the Roman letter said the same thing in Romans two Oh, you use pat yourself on the back, you know the law, you're a teacher, the law, you you have you have all these advantages and yet you say do not commit adultery. Do you commit adultery? You say, do not steal, do you steal? You're acting just like anybody else. Just because you keep the law and have this formula that you have put down, I'll make it make you aware that the Jewish line of thought when when Paul says lower than Romans and Galatians, and he refers to that you cannot be justified by the works of a wall. A lot of times what we see in that is, well, yeah, because the law shows that you're a sinner. And that's what Paul says, and all that. But when he says works, the law, the Jew is prom is primarily not thinking about everything that the law says. That's how they excuse themselves. Look, I'm connected to Abraham. through circumcision, I keep the marks of Judaism, clean and unclean foods, etc. I tend the Sabbath, I do the festivals. I got my Get Out of Jail Free card. That's quite evident. That's the way they were thinking because in Galatians, chapter five, Paul clearly says if you accept circumcision, you must accept the rest of the law. We're not doing that. That was not the way it is. That's where we need to be careful. We need to be careful that we do not picture our salvation as completing a particular formula in which we're relying on our obedience for our salvation. Do you look at it this way? Do you want to step before God on the day of judgment? And say, now, Lord, before you say anything,

Unknown Speaker  12:06
I'm obedient. I will bait you. I want you to judge me on the basis of how I obeyed

Unknown Speaker  12:12
anybody going for that one. Shoot me in the head, dude. No, that's not why I'm going for that. But no, it is. It is the difference in the ninth chapter. I mean, the 18th chapter of the book of Luke, verse nine through 13 is the difference between that Pharisee who walked in the temple and started praying, lifting his eyes up to God, and bragging about all that ENDA. And the sinner stands a far off when either look up dev and strikes his breath, and says, God be merciful to me, a center and Jesus said, He's justified. The other is not, as he this is the center of this born from above. This is what is really putting Nicodemus in an uncomfortable spot. Because if you're Nicodemus, you're thinking right now, wait a minute, I came here to see you. And you just said, I'm not in the kingdom. Are you crazy? What are you talking about? I am done the formula. I've got this down pat. And Jesus says, I don't care what you've done. The only way you're going to be in the kingdom is born from above period. That's the only way that's going to happen. Now, that's got to be something that is shocking. To any person, Jew or other religious individual. I don't care how dedicated you are, I don't care if you're a teacher in Israel, you have to be born from above. That's the only that's your only chance. And unless you are, you will never see the kingdom, you will never be in the kingdom. Those are the kinds of things that need to strike us first and foremost about this text, because that's when we need to ask ourselves, have I really been born again? Have I really been born from above and don't talk to me about I got in this water over here? Because that's not the accident. That's, that's not really what he's thought dealing with here. In fact, just to introduce this. We have Nicodemus here as being induced and introduced as an unsaved believer who has done a bunch of commandments. And Nicodemus verse 10. Jesus, I want you to see that in verse 10, Jesus says to him, Are You the teacher of Israel, and yet you do not understand these things? What conclusion should you draw from that? You are a rabbi in Israel. And you don't understand what I just said, about being born of water and the Spirit. A rabbi in Israel ought to understand what it means to be born of water in the spirit. What does that tell you about being able to understand what Jesus said? I've got to go to the Old Testament, right? I'm going to have to go to the old test, because that's what Nicodemus would have. No, he hasn't. He doesn't have acts 238. Folks, he doesn't have Mark 1616. He doesn't have all those. What he has is the Old Testament. And Jesus says, I am shocked at you. A person who is a rabbi in Israel who would know the law and you do not understand born of water in the Spirit. That's inexcusable, Nick, you need to do better than that. There's really the idea of the text. So let's go from there. And let's begin to develop the idea of what the primary message here is in this is text. Nicodemus seems to understand something about having a new start in life. You'll notice that then in, in, in the passage when in verse four, Nicodemus says, How can a man be born when he is old can enter a second time and his mother's woman be born? Now sometimes we chuckle about that. Well, I you know, Nick, he's a little dense. No, no, that's a pretty smart guy. Because what he's understanding is, is that Jesus is saying, the way you are right now doesn't work. You need to start over, you need to start all over, you know, you and I, we kick that around. Sometimes, we'd be talking, especially us old timers, we'd be talking about way back when and you know, and the dumb things we did, and we say, or sometimes I wish I'd go back and do that again. And do it right. And Nicodemus would say, Yeah, but what are you gonna do climb back into Mama's womb and start over? How could we have a new start? How can we get back to that? And that's why Jesus then gives this answer. It's not it's not born of flesh. That's not That's not the idea. It's actually born of the Spirit.

Unknown Speaker  17:08
That should make us draw one conclusion here. The message of this text is not you got to get baptized in order to be saved. That's not the message of the text. Now, please make sure you hear me carefully. A person must be baptized to have their sins forgiven and be saved. Okay? This text is not what that's talking about. This text is not referring specifically to Nicodemus, you got to be baptized for the revision of your sins. And I'm going to show you they're gonna show how bad it is. And we're going to see this, it is not something that you and I can accomplish by this rebirth simply by obeying a particular command. It goes beyond that. So let's look a little more carefully. illustrate that this way. I think most all of you would be acquainted with seven chapter book of Luke, verse 3736, down through verse 51. You remember the story of when Jesus went into Simon, the Pharisees house, remember that? And remember, a woman of the city a great senator, she's such a bad senator, as we could say, She is such a bad son. Everybody knows about her. Everybody knows what she's doing. And she comes in remember, falls at Jesus feet, weeps and kisses his feet and washes his feet where their air and Simon is looking at her, and drawing the conclusion that she's a disgusting, unclean individual, and she's making Jesus unclean by touching him, and that he ought to know better. And you remember Jesus reply, and the end Jesus actually says, Simon,

Unknown Speaker  18:56
the one who is forgiven little, loves little. Have you seen what this woman has done? Did you see your time? You didn't do anything. When I walked in this house. You were not impressed with me. You didn't You didn't give

Unknown Speaker  19:15
me a kiss. You didn't give me oil to anoint my head. You didn't do anything. She had to cease kissing my feet. She hasn't seized on precious annoying anointing of oil on my feet. She wiped it with the hair of her head. She's weeping profusely. She loved much because she was forgiven much. Ask your question, which one of them was born from above? The good rule keeping church going synagogue attending temple attending Simon, or the sinful woman, which one was born again? That's an easy question, isn't it. And it doesn't matter how many rules Simon obeyed. Because this woman through her entire reliance and dependence upon her salvation on Jesus Christ, it doesn't mean she didn't follow up with obeying God, she certainly would have. But it does mean she was not relying on self, on the power and the will and the exertion of the flesh. She was relying on God, and it was Jesus who changed her heart. And it was Jesus who caused her to see your sin. It was Jesus who caused her to weep the way she did, and have her heart opened up. And Simon sat there stoically unimpressed with the guests that he had in his house. It's an amazing difference. And it ought to be notable to us was received missing many examples of that in the Gospel, John, and I'll let you to that. But that's the thing that we need to understand about this in order to get the idea of the message. Entering the kingdom then is again, not by the will of the flesh, it's by the power of God, we've got to figure that out. We've got to understand how that works. So I'm gonna take a little journey with me, please write a journey in the Old Testament gets most of these not all of these on the screen to just save us some time. I'd like to begin where you spend a bit of time here in Deuteronomy. I'd like to begin with Deuteronomy chapter 29. And I want you to notice what Jesus said to Israel through Moses, because Jesus God said to Israel through Moses, Jesus did too but and Moses summoned all Israel and said, to them, you have seen all of the Lord did before your eyes and the land of Egypt to Pharaoh, and all his servants, all his land, the great trials that your eyes saw the signs and those great wonders. Now, you just stop right there. What did they see? Signs and great wonders? What did they see in John chapter two, that caused them to believe in Jesus signs and great wonders? Same thing, it's very, very parallel. Now what is what is it? He says, and he saw the saw the signs and great wonders, but to this day, the Lord has not giving you a heart to understand or eyes to see or ears to hear. Just like in the days of Jesus, Jesus comes and does signs and wonders and all these things. And as you read the gospel, John, you're going to see some people go, Wow, and turn around and walk away. John six, he feeds 5000. And they're just super impressed. And the next day they come and go, Hey, it's time for breakfast. And he says, You didn't see the sign. I am the bread of life. Oh, well, excuse me, we're out of here. Were they born again? They believed were they born again. They were impressed. Were they born again? No, no. That's the key. God, God says, I haven't given them a heart to understand you. And you and I read that and we go, What are you talking about? Do you have to give us a hard to weaken, understand? Yes, that's what he said, we're going to see that. But how does he do it? Ah, that will be the important part, obviously. Let's go into another.

Unknown Speaker  23:52
Notice God does in this text, what man can not do. That's the key to John three, God is doing something that man cannot do. That's the picture. Now Look at Deuteronomy 30. Now, you might notice that Deuteronomy 30 comes after Deuteronomy 29. And that's really important. Know you didn't really know that up to that particular point. But I wanted you to notice the probe close proximity between the two. And Deuteronomy 29. He said, I haven't given you a heart yet to understand. And he talks about in 2728, and 29, all the curses that God is going to bring on them, because they will not obey Him and because they're stubborn. And then in chapter 30, he says, after you've gotten into captivity, and after I bring you, you, you realize your sins and I bring you back out to your own land. He says, here's what I'm going to do for you, and the Lord your God, notice this future tense here the Lord your God. God will circumcise your heart and the heart of your offspring so that you will love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul that you may live. Alright? Would you notice that word right there? The Lord your God will circumcise your heart and the heart of your offspring so that unless God does the work, and circumcise your heart, you can't love him with all your heart, soul, mind and strength. He said, I had given your heart yet to do it now giving your heart now I'm doing something to cause you to be able to love me with all your heart, soul, mind and strength. Have you ever? And I'm sure many if not all of you have tried to talk to somebody about scriptures. Sure. What do you talk to him? Well, you talk to him about you need to obey God now Do you want a person to obey God? Let's let's just say we got a break. He says man, that's fantastic. I want to be baptized. He's baptized he comes to every surface he's he could he gets though he can wait on the Lord's take the lead and pray pretty soon say hey got pretty good voice he leads sing. But you have conversations with this man. I have a friend like this. known him for years. Goes church alta. There's not a thing in that name that indicates to me or anybody else. That he loves God with all his heart, soul mind strength, or even just trying to have a conversation with him. He's going to talk about business and all the money he makes. He's gonna talk about all the things he does in life. No, this this is just a band aid. You know, boring again, not born from above. is not like that woman who cries at the feet of Jesus can't stop kissing you. So major difference? Isn't there. A major difference? God must change your heart. Take a look at this text. Now this one you got to look at all right, I want you to see is eco chapter 36. Zero 36 is God's picture, foretelling. John chapter three and the rebirth. And wish we had time to go over a good part of chapter 36. We don't. But we will look at the verses. Let's start reading at verse 22.

Unknown Speaker  27:56
God says therefore and by the way, context of Ezekiel 36. Jerusalem is gone. Judah is gone Temple is leveled. There is no nation of Israel. Ezekiel is in captivity with the captives. And he is now explaining to them that there is future hope. Because they finally realized everything Ezekiel had said was going to happen to the destruction of the of the nation has been done, no temple, etc. So here's what God says in verse 23. utterance way that 20 You therefore say to the house of Israel that says the Lord God, it is not for your cycle house of Israel that I'm about to act, but for the sake of my holy name, which you have profaned among the nations to which you came, what's God concerned about? He's concerned about his holy name, you have destroyed my name, and I'm going to do something and just timeout Israel. And by the way, timeout us today, I'm not doing this for your sake. Get that out of your head. I'm doing this for the sake of My Holy Name. That's my primary reason. Verse 23. And I will vindicate the holiness of my great name, which has been profaned among the nations in which you have profaned among them. And the nations will know that I am the LORD declares the Lord GOD, when I first read this, I filled in the blank before I read it, and I filled in the blank of when, when I cast you off and break a new nation, and that's not what he said. When, through you, I vindicate my holiness before their eyes, I'm gonna do it through you. I'm not gonna bring a new nation. What I'm going to do is change you and everybody's going to be in awe that I can change your people who have been profaning my name and change them to glorify my name. Watch what I'm going to do verse 24, notice the over times God's doing something here. This is boring. Learn from above, I will take you from the nations and gather you from all the countries and bring you into your own way. Please don't think physically there, he's taking them out of the danger places, the sinful areas that he's sanctifying make them moly, bringing them out verse 25, I will sprinkle clean water on you, and you shall be clean from all your uncleanness is and from all your idols, I will cleanse you. And I will give you a new heart, and a new spirit I will put within you. And I'll remove the hardest stone that stubborn heart that you have, I'm going to remove that and hardest stone from your flesh and give you a heart of flesh so that you are pliable and you're responsive. And then verse 27, now put My Spirit within you and cause you to walk in my statutes and be careful to obey my rules that sound anything like what Jesus said in John three. That's not anything like what Jesus said to Nicodemus, you're a rabbi in Israel, and you don't understand this. He just talked about total transformation that is instigated by God and God alone. And something that man could not have done on their own, neither more than you were I, when we were in sin, could have created a new person and changed us the way God has changed us to this day. You're not going to have born of water. What isn't? God says I will sprinkle clean water on you. As the bow that new birth happens when you submit to immersion in water for the forgiveness of your stands. But you got to keep in mind, what's actually happening there. That's a symbolic picture of what God in heaven is doing. Sprinkling clean water on your heart and cleansing you. Last I checked that water that I was immersed in, didn't touch my heart. God can touch the heart, God can transform. And then he says then I put my Spirit in us nothing mysterious or hocus pocus. Here. He is changing us. He does that. By His revealed Word. He does that by circumstances that we encounter through trials. He changes us as a transformation. But he primarily doesn't a second Corinthians 318 says he doesn't by us looking, unveiled faces into the glory of God. We read the scriptures, we see the glory of God. And we are transformed from one degree of glory to the other. There's the picture but God is the one doing could have done it by myself. Couldn't have relied on the flesh couldn't have happened that way, by the way. Some folks today even sometimes in churches of Christ, talk about how again, you know, I got the spirit. Whatever they mean by that, oh, I

Unknown Speaker  32:56
got the spirit. But the last thing on earth they do is be careful to obey His laws and His rules.

Unknown Speaker  33:07
Please

Unknown Speaker  33:08
keep that in mind. As John would say, and First John, anyone who would say I might just change his words slightly to fit this text anymore to say, Oh yeah, I'm in fellowship with God, I've got the spirit and does not be careful to obey His rules is a liar and the truth is not any. That's a bunch of junk. If we're truly changed, will be careful to obey, cautious, very important principle that he gives this particular text in Romans eight. Now somebody says well, okay, let's get to the New Testaments. Yeah, that says here would bring all this together. In Romans chapter eight and verse 28, and 29. Remember when Paul said, circumcision is the matter of the heart, by the Spirit, not by the letter, his praises not from man but from God. Circumcision is not of the flesh, it's of the of the heart, and it's by the Spirit. Okay, this is a, like two or three sentences that you could do a whole sermon on and, and I do times, but what does he mean when he says the Spirit is doing the work of circumcising your heart? Because he made in the Old Testament, when the spirit is prophesied to do something, everything it says the spirits going to do is done through Jesus and the cross. How does pouring out the spirit in Isaiah 32 Cause the land to bring forth life caused the will ever wants to come to life? How does the pouring out of the Spirit in Ezekiel 37 Cause the dry dead bones to stand up and breathe? How does that happen? It happens through the cross. But in the Old Testament, He speaks of it as by the Spirit, because spirit in the Hebrew is life and breath. Spirit must do it God must do it's sitting right there with born from above all over again, I want you to look at this text is to help you it doesn't help you very much seeing this together. In Romans chapter five. Look at the words you've read this a lot of times even Overlord, separate which may not occurred, connect verse five, he says, An hope does not put us to shame, because God's love has been poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit who has been given to us for here's how, while we were still weak at the right time, Christ died for the ungodly. Remember, what is a kill said? He says, I'm gonna put my spirit and human I put my spirit into you and cause you to be careful to obey me. And what is Paul say here? The Holy Spirit is poured the love of God into your hearts. How did he do it? Verse six, he did it when he died on the cross, while we were still sinners, he died for us. And what did it do to your heart and mind melted our hearts. That's what brought you to Christ. That's what changed you. That's what turned everything around. You saw the love of God, and the depth of your sin, when you were helpless and hopeless and an enemy of God. Christ died for the ungodly. And that's the picture of what he was talking about in the Old Testament of how the spirit would then pour God's love into your heart and change you. That's exactly what Paul was saying in Romans eight, verse one. There is therefore now no condemnation, for those who are in Christ Jesus, for the law of the Spirit of Life has set you free. In Christ Jesus in the law of sin and dead, for God has done what the law weakened by the flesh could not do. Folks, one of the most dangerous things that we can do is treat the New Testament commandments, like the Jews treated the Old Testament commandments, as if I can line them up and count on me being saved because I think I did him well enough. You have not? And I have not. Otherwise John would not be saying In First John chapter one and verse seven. And following, that, you need to walk in the light, and the blood of Jesus will cleanse you of your sins. Wait a minute, he's talking to Christians,

Unknown Speaker  38:05
you need to confess your sins, and He's faithful and just to forgive your sins. But if you say you have not sinned, if you rely on yourself, if you're confident in yourself of your salvation, you're relying on the flesh. That's exactly what Jesus telling Nicodemus that you cannot do. God makes us completely dependent upon him. That's the only way we're going to make it. Now, let's just bring this together. Here's the message for us. Many of us, grew up like Nicodemus. Oh, not under the Law of Moses. But under a system in which we pictured our salvation over and over again. We were it was dependent on how well we obeyed. And every day, we woke up and said, I gotta do better day. I don't know if I could be saved. We may relate to that. We were given. And I'm glad we were. We were given numerous reminders that we needed to obey God. Absolutely. We just read that if God's Spirit is in you, if he gives you His Spirit, it's going to cause you to be careful to obey. But the problem is, we got very much like Simon the Pharisee. And many of the Pharisees who trusted in our own ability to keep it well enough in order for God to give us salvation, in order for us to get grace. That's an oxymoron. That doesn't fit. We became like this. You can relate. Paul says this when he's Talking about himself under the law. I do not understand my own actions for I do not do what I want. But I do the very thing I hate wretched man that I am. Who will deliver me from this body of death? He is so fed up by the end of chapter seven. He's saying, Don't you understand this June? Don't you understand? That's where you were. I had a guy that I was baptized, baptized many years ago, came out by the water and he was so excited. He says, oh, man, finally, all my sins forgiven? Is he's just just drown me, I'll go right to heaven. That's just great as well, then I wouldn't I'm not doing right. Hey, oh, man, just fantastic.

Unknown Speaker  40:41
So about three or four days later, as a man you died? Would you go to heaven? He goes wrong, I'm

Unknown Speaker  40:47
sure hope. So. What? What happened? Well, I lost my temper with my wife. I've asked God to forgive me, and I just hope I can be saved now. Sir, you do not know what it means. To have believed in the gospel of Jesus Christ. You have no idea. We need to study this again. I went over with what you lost. Let's go over the skin.

Unknown Speaker  41:24
There's no reason for a Christian to feel like they're not as clean today. As the day they came up out of that water if they truly believed and dependent upon Jesus Christ. That's the gospel message. And I'm afraid that we forgot what it meant for God, God to birth you and make you his own. There's nothing in that that says I can't turn away from be lost. That's not the thing. Do you know? Isn't it weird? I'm talking to a stranger. And I feel like I gotta give you a defense every single time. I can't just say grace. I know you better than that. But here's the picture. We had hundreds of passages that told us obey Ray. Yes, I will give thanks every day and do that my parents and my forefathers taught me to obey God. What I don't rejoice in is I got the message. I'm not blaming them. I just got it. I got the message that if I didn't keep it well enough. It was just hoping I could be saved like winning the Publishers Clearing House Sweepstakes, fat chance. And that's not that's not what we should have seen. And that's not the picture being born again. We needed more than law. Absolutely. Because God did Romans eight, three, God did what the law could not do. week through the flesh. That's exactly right. Romans 614 Remember the words for sin will not it will have no dominion over you since you are not under law, but under grace, as what Paul was saying in chapter seven sins, got me God dominion over me without Christ. But in Christ, it has no dominion over me. Because I'm not under law anymore. A law system by which I depend on myself my strength, my flesh, to be able to be right with God is not going to work that way. So Paul says in Romans eight, so then brothers, we are debtors. Look at those words, debtors, not to the flesh, to live according to flesh for you to not receive the spirit of slavery to fall back into fear. But you've received the Spirit of adoption, by whom we cry, Abba, Father. No more fear. No, no, no, no, no more of this. I don't know whether I can make it. That's not true. Now we're going to conclude with an Old Testament back to back to Deuteronomy just one day. Okay. Going back to Deuteronomy, chapter 30. And this is our last text, verses 11 through 14, Deuteronomy 30 Verse 11, through 14. Now, by the way, Deuteronomy 30, comes after Deuteronomy 29, which comes after Deuteronomy 28, which comes after Deuteronomy 27, which is all about the curses that were on Israel, if they did not keep everything God's law said. Curse be you if you do not abide by all things written in the law. But in this text, for this commandment that I command you today is not too hard for you. Neither is a far off and I'm going to argue with Moses. Are you kidding me? You just got through You're telling me in Deuteronomy 27, verse 26, that if I don't keep everything in the law, I'm cursed. And you're now telling me it's not too hard for me. You ever thought that God's law was too hard for you, a man knows it when I was young. Now, when I'm old is really too hard. It's hard to do it perfectly. But here, he says, not too hard. That's not a far off first, well, it's not in heaven that you should say, who will ascended to heaven for us, and bring it to us that we may hear it and do it. By this time, you may recognize Paul quoted this in Romans 10. Neither is beyond the sea that you should say, who go over the sea for us and bring it to us that we may hear it and do it. But the word is very near you, it is in your mouth and in your heart, look at it, so that you can do it. I want to tell you, when the Gospel means good news, that's the best news I've ever heard. You can do it. And what Paul did in this text, as he quoted is he inserted a parenthetical. It's not in heaven, that you should say, who will ascend into heaven, parentheses,

Unknown Speaker  46:19
to bring Christ down in order to die for us and save us. And then in verse, verse 13, is needed beyond the sea that you should say, who will go over the sea and bring it to us? And Paul puts in parentheses, to bring Christ up, to raise from the dead and give us the power to conquer sin, and be free from the dominion of sin. But what is it saying? Paul just quotes it this way. If you believe with all your if you believe and confess with your mouth, you'll be saved. Deuteronomy said it this way. It's near you. It's in your mouth. It's in your heart. And you can do it. There's absolutely no reason why every single person here should not be in heaven. There's no reason why you will not conquer. If you do not conquer, it's on you. Because God said you can do it. And the reason you can do it is because you're born from above Christ did something you could do. He came down and he raised up and it gave you life. And if you're

Unknown Speaker  47:34
not changed from within from that you need to spend some more time with understanding the seriousness of your sin and the greatness of what he did to give you life.

Unknown Speaker  47:52
We're gonna sing a song. Anyway that we can help you we'd be glad to do so. And please remember, unless you're born from above, you can no wise enter the kingdom of God brought together we stand
