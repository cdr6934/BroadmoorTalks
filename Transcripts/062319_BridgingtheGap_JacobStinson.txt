Good evening. Excited to be here tonight. It's very encouraging seeing everybody here. We've had a great start to the week so far. I'm excited to continue that with you guys tonight, as we look into the scripture, and what God has to say, I'm really thankful for this opportunity. I really like that our church here at Broadmoor provides men of the congregation opportunities to speak, I'm happy that I can take advantage of that. Now. I will say it is somewhat intimidating being up here with the evangelist like we have I appreciate the example so much. But when brother Roy and Conrad and Jeremy are up here, on a consistent basis, somewhat intimidating to be up here as well, it does remind me of something in my own life. Just kind of a weird segue, but I love the NBA. I love watching it. And it's just fascinating to me to see athletes like that with talent and and skills, and just world class professionals out there on the court. And a lot of times when I'm watching it with my brother and dad, you know, watching the the game there, and I wonder what it would be like if they took a fan and subbed him into the game, just what that would look like how hilarious that would be. Just the contrast of skill level, I think about myself, what if I was subbed into the game, and just kind of the entertainment that that would allow. And so when I was thinking about being up here, with those evangelists we have in our congregation, I'm kind of reminded of that. So if you've ever wondered what the Olympics of average people might look like, I think that's a good example of what this might be tonight. But like I always think about when I get up and talk in front of people, I don't ever want it to be my own personal thoughts, my own personal opinions, hopefully, this is God's thoughts, and God's commandments that come out tonight. And what in what we're looking at in the scriptures. This also probably being the last time I'll be in front of the congregation before I moved permanently away, I did also just want to take a second and thank the church here at Broadmoor for everything. That job done for me in my life, whether new members or old members, each one of you has made an impact on my life personally. So I just want to thank everybody here. And for the young people in the congregation that are listening, take advantage of this, this group here, it's a great group, take advantage of opportunities that come up, form those relationships, because these will last your entire lives. Definitely form these relationships with a young group here, there's a growing group of young people, and you'll have a lot of people of similar age and similar background that will help but definitely reach out to the older members here as well, and form those bonds and form those relationships. Because those matters, those matters just as much, if not more sometimes. And that's kind of my segue into our topic of discussion tonight. Match bridging the generational gap in our church. I also want to say thanks to BJ Syed. He's an evangelist that actually preached the sermon earlier this year, at a congregation I was at in Florida. And a lot of these a lot of the wording and things that he said I use in my lesson. But again, I'm hopefully we're just looking at what God has to say tonight and getting some lessons out of His scripture. So bridging the generational gap. This is a common problem I think we see in our world today that has crept into the church, I think a lot of problems that start in the world we see come into the church. And I think we have to be aware of that and to stop that as soon as we see it. So just like other things we see. I think we see this too often in our congregations in our congregations today.

Jacob Stinson  03:37
So to begin the lesson, I kind of want to look at what these generations we're talking about are I think we understand this to a degree but just kind of put it in black and white. I want to look at the generations we have kind of in our society today and just kind of spell them out for us. So the oldest generation right now, sometimes we call them traditionalists. We also call them sometimes a silent generation. So a lot of these different groupings will have different names and sometimes different dates depending on what you're looking at. But typically, these are people born in the mid 1940s. And before we then have the baby boomers, phrase I think a lot of us are familiar with these are people usually born mid 1940s, maybe mid 1960s. We didn't have Generation X, mid 1960s to mid 1970s. Sometimes a little bit later, you'll see all the way to 9919 80. We then have the millennials, this website I was looking at had from 1977 to the mid 1990s. Sometimes it's 1980 to 2000, but somewhere in there. And then last we had Generation Z this this generation has a lot of names right now because I think we're still trying to figure out what to call them. But for different reasons, but sometimes we'll see this from 2000 decurrent. This specific website had 1996 to current. So when we're looking up at those whether you knew those names, knew those dates or not those are familiar to us. We can kind of classify ourselves And those and we look at other people and categorize each other in a generation, whether we want to or not. And I think sometimes that's where the problem starts, is we put people in a generation, and we categorize them as that because of other people in a similar generation. But there's gaps up there. There's gaps between generations. And the further you get apart from each other, the bigger the gap is in our society. And unfortunately, the bigger the gap is in our church today. The older and the younger, seem to not know how to relate seem to not know how to work well together today. And we segment ourselves because we don't want to face this fact. We don't want to come face to face with this problem that we have. And many mainstream churches in our society are falling into that trap. I know we see a lot of churches having completely different services for the younger generation and older generation, you'll be in a setting like this, and you can look around, and someone like me not might not see somebody over 30 years old. I think that's a huge problem we're seeing in our society today, they're falling into this trap of the generational gap. groups become isolated and in turn, don't interact together. And I think that's a flaw we need to address. Obviously, we know it shouldn't be this way. God has established one church, composed of everyone who follows Christ. That is our main thing in common and we need to embrace that. And from the beginning, from the church and even before in the Old Testament, we see that we have always been made up of different generations and different ages from the very beginning. If you would go ahead and turn over to Titus chapter two. We'll start there tonight. Titus chapter two and starting in verse two here.

Jacob Stinson  06:45
aldermen are to be sober minded, dignified, self controlled sound and faith in love and in steadfastness. Older women likewise are to be reverent and behavior, not slanderers are slaves, too much one. They are to teach what is good and so train the young women to love their husbands and children to be self controlled, pure working at home kind and submissive to their own husbands that the word of God may not be reviled. And then a few pages back First Timothy chapter five. And starting in verse one, do not rebuke an older man but encouraged him as he would have father, younger minutes brothers, older men, older women, as mothers, younger women as sisters, and all purity. We need to realize that in the church, we are composed of differences of different talents and different skills. But we are all together for one goal, First Corinthians chapter 12. And start starting verse 21. The eye cannot say to the hand, I have no need of you nor again the head of the fee, I'm no need a view. On the contrary, the parts of the body that seem to be weaker, are indispensable. And on those parts of the body that we think less honorable we bestow the greatest honor, and our unpresentable parts are treated with greater modesty, which are more presentable parts do not require. But God has so composed the body giving greater honor to the part that lacked its lacked it that there may be no division in the body, but that the members may have the same care for one another. If one member suffers all suffer together, if one member is honored, all rejoice together. Verse 25, again, it says that there may be no division in the body, but that the members may have the same care for one another. That's regardless of age, that's regardless of background. And we see throughout the Bible, God has been the God of every single generation, he hasn't changed. He was the same during the days of Abraham, during the generations of Isaac and Jacob of Joseph, David, Daniel, Paul has the same god of the generations we have today. And we can't forget that. So tonight, I want to bring up a few points on what we need to be focused on when we're trying to bridge this generational gap. The same point, the first point tonight I want to look at is that we are based on the same belief here in the church. Yes, we have differences and and before I keep going, I want to make sure that we acknowledge that we do have differences. I think God has created each person unique. And like we read, we have different skills. And we can't ignore those but on the same points. One thing unifies us, and that's our belief in Christ. Because of this, we have the same values as Christians, different practices, different thoughts. Those might change from generation to generation. And sometimes we see that in culture. But these values don't change. We have the same morals have the same values, the same rules that the first the first century church had. And we know what else doesn't change and that's the living Word of God. And we can always count on that and we know that that will never change is the same word that we You always have turned over to Ephesians chapter four.

Jacob Stinson  10:17
Ephesians four and starting in verse 11. And he gave the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, the shepherds and the teachers to equip the saints, for the work of the ministry, for building up the body of Christ until we all attain to the unity of the faith and have the knowledge of the Son of God, to mature manhood, to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ, so that we may no longer be children tossed to and fro by the waves and carried about by every wind of doctrine, by human cunning by craftiness in deceitful schemes. Rather, speaking the truth in love, we are to grow up in every way into him, who is the head into Christ, from whom the whole body joined and held together by every joint with which it is equipped, when each part is working properly, makes the body gross that it builds itself up in love. Verse 13, until we all attain to the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son of God, every single one of us. And we just read a scripture from First Corinthians chapter 12, we're going to turn back over there, I won't read the whole thing again. But we see here, God, comparing our church to about to our bodies. Now, this is a great analogy, and we think about our physical bodies, we think about somebody that might have a disability that you might know, a part of their body might not work properly, they might not have a part of their body. And the disadvantage of that person is that they have to learn to cope with that. And in today's society, we have different advancements in science and things that can help but God has made our bodies to work properly together with every part. And in another way, think about someone who has a specific part of their body that might not be in sync with their mind and their brain through the nervous system or something like that, where they can't control that, that part of their body in the right way. And think about the disadvantage that they're at. And they have to learn to deal with that. And likewise, in our church, we have all these different parts that need to be working together. And they need to be working together for one head. That's how God has created this. And we have to realize that because God has meant for us all to work as different parts. We're not the same, we're different, we're unique. But we do have that same goal in mind. And that's heaven. want to stress that diversity makes us complete. I think there's a fine line we need to balance here are realizing that we all have the same goal again, but diversity makes us complete. And think about again, maybe going back to the NBA or a talented athlete or maybe a talented musician or artist, when you watch them how amazing it is to watch them perform. Somebody with that skill level, and their body. So in sync with each other with their mind, and the feats that they can they can perform. We need to realize that our church should be the same way we should be all inspired by our church acting in seamless, seamlessly acting together for one common goal just like that athlete, just like that musician on even a greater scale, working harmoniously together. Galatians three, verse 28, there's neither Jew nor Greek, there's neither slave nor free. There is no male and female for you are all one in Christ Jesus. And throughout the Bible, we have numerous examples of God bringing together people of different backgrounds of different ages and working them together, I think, a prime example or the apostles. I think when we look in the Gospels and see the people that God brought together a fisherman tax collectors zealot, a Pharisee. And think about how different those backgrounds must have been. But God brought them together. They're so different, but each brought a different perspective because of that, and they were unified by a common mission. If Christ brought them together, surely he can bring us together in today's society in today's church, we are all based on the same belief. Second point tonight, we need to realize and learn how to break down these barriers that are separating us. First, I want to talk about how we tend to major in the minors. This is a phrase I think we use sometimes. And basically what this means is we focus too much on the little things in our lives. And when we do that, that separates us even more. When we major in the minors First Corinthians chapter one.

Jacob Stinson  14:52
First Corinthians one and starting in verse 10. I appeal to you brothers, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ that all of you agree that there'll be no divisions among you but that you be united in the same mind and the same judgment. For it has been reported to me by close people that there's quarreling among my brothers. What I mean is that each one of you says, I follow Paul, or I follow Paulus, or I fall seafish, or I follow Christ. And then verse 13, starts with Is Christ divided. Obviously, he should not be divided, he isn't divided. So like this, the Corinthians here, they were divided over something that literally had no effect on their salvation. They were majoring in the minors, they were quarreling, because they were talking about who taught them who baptized them, that didn't matter. And Paul is trying to stress that to him. These minor things that we use in today's society to separate us from different generation to generation, those things don't matter at all. We must not focus on the small details, we got to take a stick, take a step back and look at the big picture. And what's really important and what our real goal is, because we all know that we have the same goal as Christians. A lot of times, we use the phrase, I can't relate, especially when we're talking about generational gaps. I know my younger generation will say I can't relate to so and so who's a lot older, the older generation, saying they can't relate to the younger generation. And that makes sense. A lot of times we understand why we can't relate because we don't have the same interest. Many times the way people might dress the music, you might listen to the way you talk different interests and hobbies. Use we use those as excuses. But yes, there are boundaries, though I understand that. There are boundaries and values that we should all still hold in common. When we're talking about breaking down barriers, there is one barrier that we know we should not break down and that sin, sin is the one barrier that we should have up. And so when things are disrupting that we do need to take a look at those. But many times, I think that the potential of a possible relationship is immediately blocked because of a snap judgment made. I think we see somebody that's different, we see somebody that doesn't have the same interest as us, somebody that's a much different age. And we don't even try to start that relationship, something that could have blossomed into something that God wanted us to have. But brothers and sisters, many times those things aren't even true. I know in my own life, I make snap judgments all the time. And I get to know that person more. And I realized that was a completely wrong judgment of that person and something I shouldn't have done in the first place. And even when they are true, we need to realize a lot of times they're not wrong, that just means somebody is different. When that judgment is true, many times it's just because they're different. Look at why you should have fellowship with that person, when you're about to make that judgment. That fellowship should be based on our faith in Christ, which we need to look past that. For a second, I want to talk to the younger generation here, this will take some self awareness. So if you think you're right on the border, just put yourself in the younger older generation, I'm not going to do it for you. But to the younger generation here. I want to stress the older generation is not out of date. I think we say that a lot of times whether we specifically say out of date or not. That's what we're thinking. The older generation is not out of date. When you think of something that's added date, it doesn't have any use anymore. thing, something in your house, maybe groceries milk. When milk is out of date, you can't use it anymore. It has no use to you, you throw it away. So when we're thinking of the older generation is out of date. Imagine you're saying that in the same way. When you're looking around here at Broadmoor, and you're thinking the older generation is out of date, I can't relate to them. They're not with the times. Are you saying that they have no use? I would say look around right now, but I know no one wants to make eye contact with the older generation right now. But the older generation is not out of date. Consider Rehoboam and First Kings chapter 12.

Jacob Stinson  19:15
Again, I won't take the time to read this whole chapter right here or the first part of it, but just to get a glance at if you're not familiar with this story, I would encourage you to read it. But we see King Rehoboam taking counsel with the old men, and then the young men. And we know what he chose to follow in verse eight, but he abandoned the counsel that the old men gave them and took counsel with the young men who had grown up with him and stood before him. So think how much more comfortable Rehoboam probably was with the younger men. He had grown up with them. They were probably his some of his friends, people he could quote relate to. He didn't consider them out of date and reading During the rest of story, we know what ends up happening and the consequences of rebounds. Actions here, rebounded and follow this concept. Deuteronomy 32 And verse seven, remember the days of old, consider the years of many generations, ask your father and he will show you show you your elders, and they will tell you, Hebrews 13, seven, Remember your leaders, those who spoke to you the Word of God. So younger generation, guess what, we don't have to figure it out. I know for myself, I don't have a lot of stuff figured out. So when we think like that, is way more than we should be thinking we do not have it figured out. And whether we think that it's smart to go to the older generation or not, whether you are picturing someone in your life and saying, I actually do think I know more than them. If for some reason you think you do have more experience, it doesn't matter. Because as we're reading, it's a commandment of God, to seek out wisdom from the older generation. So it doesn't matter if you think it's wise or not. It's a commandment of God. And we know, there's no question over the commandments of God that we should follow them. Okay, for a brief second, now to the older generation, and I'm no place to do this. But I have a disgust with other people. And hopefully, I will say things in the right way. Basically, the main point I want to make is that you can trust us. I think that's maybe one fault that comes into mind with the older generation is sometimes maybe cynical and not believing you're trusting in the younger generation, sometimes for good reason. But I think sometimes that can come too much into play. The older generation needs to realize we need to be taught, we need instruction, Psalm 71, and 18. So even to old age and gray hairs, oh God, do not forsake me until I proclaim Your might to another generation, your power to all those who come. Psalm 145, verse four, one generation shall command your works to another and shall declare your mighty acts. So my question to the older generation is, how will I, how will we be prepared if we're not taught? Sometimes it might come into play that the older generation might be complaining that the younger generation doesn't listen very well. Again, sometimes these accusations are true, but I want to say you can't complain about people listening and then not act on it. Same with the younger generation, we can't complain about each other not listening, and not at least take that action to speak out and talk to those and create those relationships. And as a young person, I know that I'm going to learn from somebody, you can't grow up in the world today, you can't grow up in the church and not learn something. That's just how we're wired as humans, how guys creators, we learn. And I want to ask you, if we're not learning from the older generation, who are we going to learn from? I think about each other. And that's a really scary thought to think about that the younger generation is teaching each other. We see in Luke six, the warning of the blind leading the blind. And I think that's a great analogy for that concept in today's society, that if we're not learning from the older generation, we're going to learn from each other, and we don't have the experience and the wisdom that you guys have. And we need that in our lives. I also want to stress that we can't let language be a barrier in our lives. And this is a little bit more of a of a surface level concept. But I think sometimes we can't even get past the surface and somebody talks differently than us. And we can't relate to them. To the young people, when you say roll down a window, that's because you used to actually have to roll down a window. I think my correct and saying that. When you're typing an email, a cc means carbon copy. I'm pretty sure a lot of people my age don't know that. When you say you're on the other line on the phone. I don't know what we think that means. But I there were lines back in the day that you switched from, I think,

Jacob Stinson  24:06
to the old people, I would just say for the surface level level words, just don't even worry about them. If we say something is on fleek, or slay or something is lit, or if we're keeping it 100 I would just say don't worry about that and get back to the what's most important. A fortnight is not two weeks. That's not what that means. And I know these are mainly jokes right now, but I think it's serious. We can't get past some of the ways we talk sometimes because somebody doesn't talk like us, and we can't relate to them. But I want to stress tonight that we can relate we get a we got to get past this barrier of language. We need to stop isolating each group. If the older generation wants to help the younger generation. Don't segregate us include us. There's a time in place and I think Baba classes and young devotionals and stuff like that is good. But I think sometimes we take this to an extreme and it's becoming too common. When I was looking online about solutions, to see what people had to say on Google about bridging the generational gap in the church, a lot of it came from institutional churches, and mainstream churches that are used to splitting people up. And the solutions alarmed me. Because they were very simple things to say, have a worship service with everyone. To me, that should be like a for sure thing, I don't understand how people in the world are saying that's their main solution. Let's make sure everybody's together when we worship God. That's how far our society has gone from this. We need to be mentored us young people, those relationships, like I said earlier can be some of the most valuable in our lives for a reason. And then last last barrier, want to talk about his selfishness, this is a little bit of a deeper barrier. But I think this is at the core of many times when we are creating differences among ourselves, we are viewing ourselves in a way God does not want. I think many times whether we want to admit it or not, we are assuming that we are better or more special, we think that we might be superior to somebody else, and therefore we can't relate to them. We haven't figured out we don't need to know what somebody else thinks. Because we haven't figured out we don't want to relate to them. Now I think at the core of that is just being selfish and thinking too highly of ourselves. And there's a couple senses in this word special that I think we get wrapped up in sometimes, yes, we are special in that we are children of God, and God has created us, we are special. But we are all special. And because of that, that doesn't make one person more special than somebody else. We are all on the same playing field. And when we segregate other people and create these differences in these gaps in generations and different things, that saying that we have it figured out, we don't need to know what you know, and we don't need your wisdom. So selfishness, selfishness, I think is at the core of this as well. Last point tonight, we know we're based on the same beliefs, we know we need to break down these barriers. So how do we build these bridges? How do we build the bridges of the age of the generational gaps? First, I want to talk about time. I think time is very important and possibly the most important, we need to spend time with each other. Turn over to first Timothy chapter three.

Jacob Stinson  27:27
First Timothy three and verse 15. I know this verse is kind of taken in the middle of a sentence. But I think you'll understand the point in just a second first. First Timothy three in verse 15, if I delay, you may know how one ought to behave in the household of God, which is the church of the living God, a pillar and buttress of the truth, I specifically just want to focus on that word household of God. For those that phrase right there. This word in Greek oitavos, I believe it's pronounced, I'll probably get some correction on that later. This means a house, a dwelling a family sometimes, and we see the same word using the same chapter in verses four, five and 12. So this household, this household of God is a family. And what families do families spend time together, I want you to think about your own family for a second. And when you grow most as a family. I know when I started thinking about this, I think about the kitchen table, eating meals together, that's a time our families together. That's time our family is talking and interacting. And we grow as a family. I also thought about family vacations, we just took one about a month ago. Sometimes those can be hard, you're cramped together, maybe some fights break out and other things. But ultimately, your family is growing. Your family has to interact together, your family is learning more about each other. We have to be together. Because we are a family and even a stronger sense of the word in the family of God. If we want to grow, we have to be together, it has to be more than once a week has to be more than twice a week. If we're not, I want to stress that I think we're neglecting our families. And we think about that in our physical families. And we you know, throw up a red flag Whoa, don't accuse me of neglecting my family, we think of maybe a father not being there for his kids or a sibling maybe running away from home or something like that. And that's what we think of neglecting of the family. But when we don't spend time together in the church, I want to stress that that's neglecting our family. And that's not doing what God has commanded us to in the Scripture. I think this takes a conscious and proactive effort. We're not going to find ourselves Tuesday afternoon and walk into our house and a bunch of people are there from our church and list as a surprise party or something. I don't know. We have to make time and make plans to spend time together with other Christians. We have to be proactive with this. And make sure that we are spending time together praying spending time together singing, serving, being hospitals are hospitable to other people. And even beyond spiritual things, just spend time hanging out. I know that's also a generational term, but just being together spending time together. I think that's how we grow. Another way we can build a bridge is the concept of mentorship and being a mentor, the older generations to the younger, in second Timothy chapter two. And starting in verse one. You then my child be strengthened by the grace that is in Christ Jesus, and, and what you have heard from me in the presence of many witnesses, entrust to faithful men, who will be able to teach others also.

Jacob Stinson  30:47
We need to be making disciples of other men. I think a good analogy is the environment today, we hear a lot about that we hear about going green and saving the Earth. And what stressed when people are talking about that on the news of different things is saving it for future generations. I don't think scientists usually are saying that the world's going to end in our generation right now. So we're talking about saving it for future generations. I think that's the same concept that we need to use in mentorship is preparing the next generation. Because our impacts as a Christian is not supposed to die with us. Our impact should live on and keep teaching and teaching. We can't just worry about our own generation like Paul, to Timothy here, we need to prepare the next one and this builds relationships, we see Paul called Timothy his son in the faith. Turn over to Psalm 78. Psalm 78, and starting in verse two

Jacob Stinson  31:47
I will open my mouth in a parable I will utter dark sayings from of old things that we have heard and known that our fathers have told us, we will not hide them from their children, but to tell the coming generation the glorious deeds of the Lord and His might and the wonders that he has done. He established a testimony and Jacob and appointed a law in Israel, which he commanded our fathers to teach their children that the next generation might know them, that children yet unborn and arise and tell them to their children, so that they should set they're hoping God and not forget the works of God, but keep His commandments, and that they should not be like their fathers and stubborn and rebellious generation, a generation whose heart was not steadfast whose spirit was not faithful to God, I also want to stress we need to embrace our differences. We see in Ephesians, four in First Corinthians 12, God describing the body of Christ as a physical body and comparing that and each part has something different to offer. Each generation has something to bring to the table. And when we think about that, we need to learn, you know, what are the strengths and weaknesses of each generation and how do we work well together. When we're looking at traditionalists, again, these are kind of broad scopes and not might not be specifically about you, but traditionalist just Oh traditionalist, are typically typically hard workers, but many times resistant to change. Baby Boomers are great team players, but sometimes too competitive Generation X is known to balance their lives well, but sometimes don't speak their minds. Millennials are many times independent. But because of that struggle to work well in a team, Generation Z is usually great at multitasking, but sometimes aren't the most loyal. I know a lot of those have to do with the workplace, but I think they carry right over into the church. And you might be able to relate to some of those. But we need to be aware of these things so that we can grow together, we need to understand each other's strengths and weaknesses, because that's how God has fit us together in the church. But brothers and sisters, how can we become aware of these things? If we don't talk to each other? And we don't form these relationships? How do you know what Brother so and so is struggling with? If you don't go talk to him? How do you know what sister so and so is good at and you can learn from her. If you don't form that relationship with her. We have to talk to each other or these things will not become apparent in our lives, and we won't be able to grow together. All the generations have so much wisdom and experience to share younger generations have so much energy and time. I think God has fit that pretty well together so that we're working for him. Ephesians four starting in verse 15. Rather speaking the truth in love we are to grow up in every way into him who is the head into Christ, from whom the whole body joined and held together by every joint with which it is equipped. When each part is working properly, makes the body grow so that it builds itself up in love. Let every joint supply what it can. Let's work together as one body and build the bridges that will cross these bridges. generational gaps in our church, and that starts here in this family, it starts tomorrow. It starts tonight. And it's one day at a time, it's not going to happen in a week or a month, mentorship, all these things take time to grow. And I think that's what's beautiful about it is these relationships will grow and prosper and branch out to other Christians elsewhere, in our country throughout the world. And I think that's God's plan. It's a beautiful thing to think about, but we need to enact it in our lives. We can't just sit here thinking about it. Tonight, I've talked a lot about our family in Christ. If you're sitting here tonight, and you're not part of that family, you might feel a little bit left out. Well, I don't think that's the main reason you need to join the family use that to motivate you, why do you feel left out? Why do you feel like you don't have that hope of heaven, and look inward, and realize that you might be ready to become a Christian that might be tonight. If you are in the family of God, you might have been away for a little bit, not physically, but maybe spiritually, maybe in your mind. And you need some encouragement, and prayers. You need to make something known to the congregation. We'll sing a song in just a second. And we can use that time right now to make that known. If not, then after the service is over or at any point, approach somebody so that that new relationship can be done, and our relationship with you can be restored, or begin as a new member in the family of Christ. If we can do anything at this time to help you please come to the front while we stand and sing
