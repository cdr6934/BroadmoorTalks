Good morning if you have your Bibles I want to be opening up to Romans the eighth chapter Romans chapter eight.

Conrad Harkrider  00:29
In 1958, there were three men, Warren Harding, George Whitmore, and Wayne marry, who became the first individuals ever to scale the 3000 foot granite monolith in Yosemite National Park, known as El Capitan, now took these three men about 45 days, and they did it over the course of 18 months, they would work for a few days, set some ropes in place, stop and then come back. And so it took them about a year and a half, but they did it eventually they reached the summit. Since that time, there have been 1000s of people that have climbed this rock mountain. In fact, recently, there were two men who made it to the top in under two hours. Now that in part has been because there have been significant advances in the type of gear that people use, there are anchors that are fixed to the side of the rock wall, the routes going up have been meticulously mapped out every corner and little part that the the climbers are going to encounter. Unfortunately, there's still no incline railway that leads to the top or the elevator that I'm sure most of us would opt for. But this is incredible. This past week in the news, there was a story that came out about a 10 year old girl, she was the youngest climber ever to make it to the top. And it took her five days her and her dad made it to the summit. I'm sure that Warren Harding, George Whitmore, and Wayne marry, probably never could have imagined all of the feats that would be accomplished on this wall. But yet they laid the groundwork, they opened the door, they were just the first of many. In Romans chapter eight and verse 29. Paul refers to Jesus Christ as the first born among many brothers. He is the first born of God, Jesus holds a special place of significance. He is God's son, and he receives the blessings from God, he holds a special place of importance. But his desire is not just to hold all of that glory, and that honor for himself. He's not just he's not wanting to be the only one who is a found accepted in God's sight. He wants other others to be able to follow that same path, to be adopted as sons and daughters of God to be like him to partake in those same blessings that He Himself has received. Just as Christ was raised from the dead, so to we will one day be resurrected to immortality. But in order for us to become his brother and his sister to reach the summit to follow that same path that he walked, Paul says that we must be conformed to the image of His Son, we must be conformed, we must be changed to the image of His Son. Read with me in Romans chapter eight, beginning in verse 28, Romans eight verse 28. It says, and we know that for those who love God, all things work together for good for those who are called according to His purpose. For those whom he for knew, He also predestined to be conformed to the image of His Son, in order that he might be the firstborn among many brothers. And those who He predestined, he also called, and those whom He called he also justified and those whom He justified, he also glorified. Romans eight is one of the most encouraging chapters in the book of Romans, if not in the entire Bible. Because Paul again and again, offers these incredible blessings, these promises that are given to God's people and I want to highlight a few of those. Look at Romans chapter eight and verse one. In Romans eight and verse one, he says, There is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus, for the law of the Spirit of Life has set you free in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and death. For those in Christ, there is no condemnation, we have been set free. Also notice what he says in verse 11. In verse 11, if the Spirit of Him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells in you, He who raised Christ Jesus from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies, that same power that God used to overcome death and raise Jesus up, he will use that to one day resurrect and give life to our mortal bodies. Also, in verse 15, he says, for you to not receive the spirit of slavery to fall back into fear, but you have received the Spirit of adoption as sons. Instead of living our lives under the fear of condemnation, and being enslaved to our sins, we are now adopted, we are children of God, through His Spirit. And then in verse 18, he says, I consider that the sufferings of this present time, the sufferings of this present time are not worth comparing with the glory that is to be revealed in us. What we are going through now, in this present life is nothing, it's not even worth comparing with the glory that will one day be revealed in us. And then finally, from our text this morning, verse 28, he says, that, we know that for those who love God, all things work together for good for those who are called according to His purpose. So you see all of these blessings, these great statements that God is giving to his people to provide comfort and assurance and hope that here in verse 28, all things work together for good. This might be one of the most quoted verses in the book of Romans, if not in the entire Bible. Many people know the phrase, all things work together for good. But it's important to notice the scope of what Paul is saying here, and who he addresses this to notice this is to those who, who love God, those who are called according to His purpose, those two groups, that those are that's talking about the same people, those who love God, those who are called according to His purpose. This is not a universal statement that's given to every person who is alive today. There's a lot of bad stuff that happens in the world. There's violence, there's drugs, there's people who profane God's name is God somehow orchestrating or using every single one of those events for some greater purpose. Well, we know Ecclesiastes tells us that time and chance happen in this world. And also remember, there is someone else who is working the ruler of this age, the devil has his plans, and his purposes. So I don't think Paul is saying that every single event in life will somehow come out for good. But what he is telling his people here is that God is in control. God is working throughout eternity throughout our lives in order to bring about his purposes, no matter what happens in this world. Whether it is from our perspective, good or bad. When it's all said and done. Ultimately, God will win he is going to bring his blessings upon his people, because he is working things together for good in our study. In the adult class from Exodus, you see this, how the picture looks very dark. Children are being thrown into the Nile River. But yet God the entire time is working to bring about a deliverance, a great deliverance for his people, and to bring them into their own land. So God causes all things to work together for good these verses. It's important to spend a little time on that because this verse plays into verses 29 and 30, verses 29 and 30, are expounding upon this idea of God causing all things to work together for good. So verse 29, for those whom he for new, He also predestined to be conformed to the image of His Son in order that he might be the firstborn among many brothers and gnomes. Those whom He predestined, he also called and those whom He called he also justified, and those whom He justified, he also glorified. If you notice, there is five different terms that are used here. And there is a succession. It goes from one to the next. He says that they are those whom he for knew He predestined, he called he justified, and then he glorified. And what is the central point in all of this? What is God ultimately trying to do? What is His will and His intention for us that we would be conformed to the image of His Son, this is the process by which we can become conformed to the image of Christ. So let's spend a little time on each of these. First of all, he for new, this is not a word that we use very often, that we for new something, but it means to have knowledge beforehand, God knew something before it even happened. And what is it that God knew that he was going, he was going to have a people Ephesians chapter one. And verse four says that before the world was even created, before the heavens and earth, and the foundation of the world was laid, God chose us, in Him. God chose us in Christ, he knew that there would be a plan. He knew that he would have a people that he was going to save, that he would draw to himself. And he knew that that was going to come through Jesus Christ. In Romans chapter three, in verse 22, it says, The righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ, for all who believe for there is no distinction. God's righteousness, and the peace that he offers to people comes through Jesus Christ. And that was a plan that God for knew that he had planned long before you or I were ever born. In Romans chapter five and verse 11. It says more than that, we also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom we have now received reconciliation. It is only through Christ, that we can be reconciled to God, the Jews, this letter is written to both Jews and Greeks who were living in Rome and the Jews were having a difficult time accepting the fact that Jesus of Nazareth was the Messiah, he was the one that God was going to was going to use, to deliver and to bless his people that he didn't fit the mold. He wasn't writing into the capitol in a conquering way, overthrowing his enemies, his physical enemies. And so the picture of a suffering Christ didn't fit their picture of what a Messiah should be. But what Paul is trying to emphasize here is that this was God's will this was God's plan all along. It wasn't as if Jesus was somehow popular among some of the Jews and the apostles and, and Paul himself and then they tried to insert him into God's plan and make up a storyline around him. Now all of the Old Testament is leading up to this, all of God's revelation is pointing to the Christ. When you think about the people that God for new, think, collectively think in terms of a in a corporate nature, not individually, not that he for new Tom and Jane and Sally, and Bob, but yet he for knew that there would be a people a body of people. In Romans chapter nine, Paul speaks in a similar way, when he talks about Jacob and Esau, and he says that the older would serve the younger, and that's speaking about the nations that would come from Jacob and Esau, the, the Edomites, from Esau, when ultimately end up serving the Israelites from Jacob. It's referring to these nations and not the brothers themselves. And so we see the same thing here with God for knowing about his people. So how does this provide comfort to the Romans and how does it provide comfort to us today?

Conrad Harkrider  14:37
Well think about if you were planning a family reunion, and the place where you're going to go into have this was in another city, and you had to book the venue. And you and you did that five years in advance. And you went ahead and you started planning out all of the details. You made the reservations for the food you booked the lodging you paid for the flights and the tickets, you got personalized gifts for each person who was going it was going to attend. What is that? What would that tell you, other than you have a lot of money. But that this is something that is important. This is a significant event. There's a special occasion that's about to occur. And so there's planning and there's detail and there's effort that's put into it is different than just sending a text message and saying, Let's get together this next weekend throwing it off the cuff. And what we see with God's plan is this. This is something that he has been working towards, throughout all human history. It's important and it's it's special. This has been God's glorious plan from eternity and who are we? Or who is someone to say that I don't like this or this is not a good plan. He has paid for everything. He has laid it out for us and made every provision for us. He has also predestined us. He's predestined us. This again is not a word that we commonly use. Some of the other translations say for ordained, or appointed or chose. The idea is that this is something that has been done in advance, predestined is the next step. It's different from four knowledge because there is some type of action that is involved. It's more than just God knowing something or having a plan or information in his mind. But now he is moving forward with that. He is taking steps to make this a reality. And what is it that God is choosing or appointing for his people, that they would be conformed to the image of His Son. That's what he has predestined for his people. If you want to join the United States Army today, there's a list of requirements that they have laid out. For for people who are trying to enlist, you have to be between 17 and 34 years old, you have to be a resident or a citizen of the United States, you have to have two or less dependents that you are supporting. You have to have a high school diploma or a GED you have to pass a medical exam and a and a fitness test. These are the requirements The Army has predetermined, the type of people that can join the airforce. Now not talking about a draft. But during normal peacetime conditions, they don't go out and select specific individuals, but rather they they recruit, they promote, they advertise and then if you decide to enlist, you have to meet these predefined requirements. In a similar way God has predetermined what his people will look like. He's laid out a plan and set up the the characteristics of those who are going to be cleansed from their sins. In Matthew chapter five, as the crowds began to come to Jesus. Do you remember what he did? He went up on to the mountain and began to teach them and he said, Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. Blessed are those who mourn. Blessed are the meek. Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness. Those are the types of people that Christ was seeking to draw to himself. There are many people that came to hear and to listen. But not everyone was receptive or willing to follow because God had predetermined the type of people that he wanted to come to Him. In the same way the gospel is presented today to many people, but few answer and receive the message ultimately the call that choice is left to us.

Conrad Harkrider  19:23
Notice that those who come must be conformed to the image of His Son. We have to be conformed. What does that mean to be conformed to change or to become like something else? When I was younger, my family moved from the state of Colorado to the state of Texas. Those are two very different places geographically, culturally, and I remember one of my family members asking us if we were kind of tongue in cheek if we were going to become Southerners. We were going to start talking with an accent and using words like y'all and wearing cowboy boots. And I think I picked up a few of those things. But when you start to live in a new place, around a new culture, you begin to pick up, you begin to adapt to their way of doing things. When people come to God, His eternal plan that he's had for all time is not for us to just be who we are, stay the same way. Think how we think act, how we act, live, how we live, come as you are. God's eternal plan is for us to be conformed to change the way that we think, are for our former lives. Those are, that's a life of flesh. It's focused on earthly things. It's centered on my desires, my thoughts and my will, but coming to God, there is a change, we have to conform ourselves to be like Christ. And that's ultimately what he has predestined his people for God for knew He predestined. And then he called, he called the gospel, in its very essence is a call that goes out. In Romans chapter one and verse 16. It says, For I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes, to the Jew first, and also to the Greek. The gospel is offered to who he says, Every one who believes, to the Jew first to those who are descended from Abraham to those who had received the promises of God, but not just to them, but also to the Greeks to those who are outside of Israel. God offers this blessing to all men. In Romans chapter 10. And verse 14, it says, and how are they to believe in Him in whom they have never heard? And how are they to hear without someone preaching? And how are they to preach unless they are sent? As it is written? How beautiful are the feet of those who preach the good news? Paul is using a a step by step reasoning here. This is logical reasoning here, have you ever done this with your with your kids, you say something like, we can't make cookies unless we have sugar. And we can't get sugar unless we go to the store. And we can't go to the store. Unless you stop crying and get dressed. It's a succession. These are the things that have to happen in order for the end result, to come to fruition. Paul says people can't believe if they don't hear. People can't hear unless someone preaches and they can't preach unless they are sent. There are societies there are fraternities and organizations nowadays that are that are very secretive. Membership is exclusive. You can only get into the club unless you are invited if you receive a special invitation from someone. But that's not how the gospel works. The Gospel isn't intended to be offered to all people throughout all time. This is an amazing truth for us to understand and to comprehend and to remember that the truth and the message that we have received is not intended to bottle up to hold to ourselves to keep private and secret, or to only share with our family or those who are closest to us. This is intended to be delivered to all people. Do you remember what Jesus told his disciples?

Conrad Harkrider  24:02
He said, What I tell you in your ear, what I whisper to you, I want you to what? I want you to proclaim it on the rooftops. I want you to share it broadly. Have you ever thought what it would be like if God didn't call if he didn't offer this message out? We would be it would be hopeless. It would be luck or chance that we would stumble across the knowledge of God of the message of salvation. But it's incredible that he does call us because of the fact that he doesn't need us to come to him. There's nothing that we offer to God that He is in need of. And furthermore, when we do come, we are people who are broken, we are wretched, we are sinful, we are flawed. So why does God call all people to Himself? You know the answer to that is because of love. God loved us so much that He sent Christ to die for us. We are His children. And we have to have that same love and concern for other people. So that the call doesn't just end with us, but it can continue to go out into the whole world. This call in this context is referring to those who have accepted the call those who have answered the call, they received the message. They hear the voice of their father, and they respond to the One who created them. God has called us those who answer the call. He has also justified, he has justified us justified is to be forgiven. This is a legal term that Paul is using, he uses it throughout the letter of Romans. Think of it in terms of a courtroom, someone who is standing before a judge charges are brought against them. But instead of being pronounced guilty and being sentenced, for the crimes that they have committed, they are released, they are acquitted of those things. They are made Free of the guilt and Romans he says that we are declared righteous in God's sight. In Romans chapter three and verse 23, it says, For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, and are justified by his grace as a gift through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus. You notice how we receive this redemption, this justification, this forgiveness, what is the means by which it is transferred to us. It says here that this is a gift from God. It is a result of his grace, something that he offers to us, not something not because of something that we ourselves do. This is one of the major themes in the book of Romans. There's two groups of people there's this contrasts in the book. On the one hand, you have those who are living according to the flesh, they are keeping the Law of Moses, they put emphasis on the things that they do the ordinances that they keep their heritage, their lineage, who they are connected to, they are focused on, the focus is on themselves and what they have done and who they are. But then there's another group, those who are justified by faith, they walk in the footsteps of Abraham, they trust in God's plan, they put their their hope, in the power of the blood of Christ. And the focus is not on themselves, but instead on what God has done. Romans chapter eight and verse five, says that they set their mind on the things of the Spirit, instead of the things of the flesh. Those who are in Christ have been justified, we've been justified. And that provides a couple of things for the believer. First of all, it gives us hope. We are no longer living under the fear of being condemned by God because we have been justified, we're no longer subject to be slaves of sin. And what that means practically for us is that we should not be carrying around the guilt and the burden and the remorse of past since

Conrad Harkrider  28:39
so many Christians have been released from their sin. But yet each morning, morning, they wake up and they put on the shackles of guilt, and of regret, they get back into the prison clothes and they drag themselves through those feelings of remorse. God has set us free from those things, he's justified us. And so it gives us hope. Being justified also provides us with resolve. In Romans chapter six, he talks about how we have crucified the old man we have died to our former way of living, because God has justified us we now live with a certain level of resolve not to return to those things, not to fall back into our former way of living but now we walk in newness of life. We don't go back to slavery or fear. We are determined to serve God in a new way, because he has justified us and finally, those whom he has justified, he also glorified. Look at Romans chapter eight and verse 18. Romans 818 It says, For I consider that the sufferings of this prayer isn't time are not worth comparing with the glory that is to be revealed in us. The suffering that we might encounter in this present life is not worth comparing with the glory that God is going to reveal in us. One day God will glorify His people. Here he speaks in the past tense, he says glorified, I believe that's because this is something that is certain to happen. God knows that he is going to glorify His people from his perspective, there's no question he will save and deliver his people. In verse 23, it says that we eagerly await for the redemption of our bodies. This is something that we as God's children we anticipate, we look forward to it. We are desiring this to come more than retirement more than graduation, more than getting married more than starting a family more than building the house. We are desiring to be glorified with Christ. being conformed to the image of His Son means that we live like Jesus. We imitate his example. We think in the same way that he thought, we follow his path, we listen to his words. But it also means that we're willing to suffer just as he did. To be treated with contempt to be rejected to be even to be hated because of our faith in Christ's suffering is not something that we enjoy that we welcome that we seek out or pursue. But as the Lord said, Anyone who would follow him must take up their cross and come after him. Whatever pain or hurts that we might endure in this life. All of it is for the Lord. It's bringing us one step closer to being glorified with Him. In Romans chapter eight, in verse 16, it says, The Spirit himself bears witness with our spirit, that we are children of God. And if children, then heirs heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ, provided we suffer with Him, in order that we may also be glorified with Him. To be conformed to the image of His Son means to be made like him, both in suffering, and in glorification. Christ is the first born of God, he came, so that we would have an example to follow. So that one day, through our suffering, and our effort here in this life, we also can be glorified, and reach that summit, the same place where he is today, sitting at the right hand of God in God's presence forever. We're going to close with a song and an invitation and if you have not submitted your life to God's eternal plan, if you have not answered the call, to obey God, to reach out to step out in faith, and to submit your life to Him, there's no greater opportunity than right now. We encourage you. If you have a need, please come down to the front as we stand and sing
