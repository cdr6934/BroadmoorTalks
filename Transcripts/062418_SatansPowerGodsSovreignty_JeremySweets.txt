Good evening. It's good to see everyone here tonight. It's always good than when we can gather together and worship our God appreciate the fact that you're here with us. Tonight, we have many visitors. And we want you to know you're our honored guest. We're glad that you're here with us. Our goal and our aim at Broadmoor is to give God glory and praise and all that we do. So we're glad that you're here with us to worship and also assists at this time as we study from God's Word. When I was in college, I would play this is really bad, the word just left me a whole illustration depends on this let me paint ball. What when I was in college, I would play paintball with a group of guys, Mark Seaton may have even been in that group of guys that played with me. But we would split up into teams. And we didn't have a professional course that we played on, but we would go to my brother's house, and he had a bunch of woods, and we would roam around in the woods, we'd have these colored shirts on and to know who's was on each team. And we would try to eliminate the other team. And I can remember walking through the woods, trying to be as quiet as I could, with heightened senses, looking out for the other team, because you didn't know where they were, where they're coming from your ears were listening, you were trying to see if you could hear a snap of a twig. You're trying to hear if you could hear any chatter out there. And you were watchful and careful about what was out there. Now, I've not been in the military. But I remember thinking as I was walking around, trying to shoot people with paint, and trying to avoid being shot, how difficult it would be to be in the actual military, when that paint was not paint, but rather bullets. Like I said, I've not been in the real military, that would be a frightening thing, to know that your life is on the line in a battle. Well, we as Christians are not in a physical battle. But we are in a spiritual battle. And I believe we need that same heightened sense then and realization of the stakes. And Ephesians chapter six, if you'd open your Bibles to Ephesians chapter six, in verses 10, through 12, Ephesians, six, verses 10 through 12. We see here that there is a battle that is raging spiritually fasion six and verse 10. Finally, be strong in the Lord and then the strength of his mind, Put on the whole armor of God, that you may be able to stand against the schemes of the devil. For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the cosmic powers over this present darkness against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly places. And it goes on to talk about the whole armor of God and our need to put on the whole armor. And we need to put on the whole armor because we are indeed in a battle. And notice that there are two main sides of this the powers of good and the powers of evil. And the text tells us to be strong in the Lord and in the strength of his mind, put on his armor, the armor of God, God's forces are God's side is one song. God is battling against fleshly, or evil powers, the powers over this present darkness it says against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly places. So I'd like to talk for just a few moments this evening about the spiritual powers primarily about God and Satan, and the battle that is raging.

Jeremy Sweets  04:15
So if we were to describe Satan, we see that Satan first of all is described in Matthew chapter 13, verse 10, as evil or as the evil one, I think that pretty well describes who Satan is. He is one that is evil, and he also seeks evil. He seeks evil against us. He is one that is our adversary. It says according to First Peter, chapter five and verse eight, he is our opponent. He is on the other side trying to put us to death. First Peter five eight uses the language of devour. And so you have this picture of destroying, we see he is also the tempter In Genesis chapter three verses one through seven, he is the one that is trying to pull us away from God and fellowship with God. And He does that by tempting us to sin. Isaiah 59 tells us that sin separates us from God and that is his aim. That is his goal to separate us from God. Revelation chapter 12. And verse 10, calls him the accuser, the accuser, his aim, or his goal is to point out to bring the charge against those that are faithful. He is the accuser. And in Revelation chapter nine in verse 11, he is described as the Hebrew term to Abba Don or Apollyon, in Greek, which simply means the destroyer, the destroyer, I'm not going through and reading all those passage, but we see descriptions often, of Satan and who he is. And I think just these few descriptions give us a pretty good idea of what he is about. He is about destroying us. Now, that's warfare language, isn't it? He wants to put us to death. And this isn't paint is it? He wants to put us to death. And so his, his tactic is one of of evil and getting us to do evil. He wants us to join our his forces so that we can be separated from God. He wants, not what is best for us, but He wants our harm, or harm. Now, God, on the other hand, is really the exact opposite. He is good.

Jeremy Sweets  06:46
What he makes is good. There is no sin in him, he cannot lie, he is good. And what he wants for us is good. In Psalm 119, and verse 68, says that the Lord is good, the Lord is good. We see in the creation that when he created, when he looked at the creation, he could say that it was good and that makes sense, a good God makes a good creation. We also see that the comforter is within the Godhead, as Jesus said, When I leave, I will leave you with a helper or a comforter. God is not our adversary. He's not our opponent, but he wants to be our friend. And he sent the Comforter, the helper in the Holy Spirit. We see in James chapter one and verse 17, that God is the giver of every good and perfect gift. Again, that makes sense, doesn't it? God is good himself. And so what he gives is good. That text also tells us that God cannot tempt or does not tempt anyone for evil. He does not want us to sin, He does not tempt us to sin. And even when we see in the text in the Bible, that that God test or tries certain people we see the motivations are completely different. Satan tempts because he wants and he desires people to sin. That's what he wants. But when God tries his goal, and his aim is always that they would withstand, that they would be strong. And so Satan tempts us, but God is not a tempter. He gives us only good things, he does not send us bad things or want us to do bad things. He's also seen in First John chapter two and verse one, that John is writing these things that we may not sin, but if we do sin, we have an advocate in Jesus Christ. And so he is not an accuser. You think about a courtroom scene, one that brings the accusation or the charge, this one is guilty. No, but rather, Jesus Christ is our advocates, one that will argue the case for us be on our side. And we also see that God is not a destroyer of life, but just the opposite is the giver of life. In Genesis two and verse seven, He breathed into the nostrils of man the breath of life, God is life. And so when we put these powers side by side, we can see that there's many opposite things about them. Many things that are just the exact opposite when it comes to good and evil. Notice also that we see that Satan has great power. Satan has great power. And first John foggy verse 19. It says that the whole world lies in the power of the evil one. The whole world lies in his power. He has a Trump In this amount of power, notice in First Peter chapter five and verse eight, a passage we looked at in our class this morning, but bears looking at again, First Peter five and verse eight. It says, Be sober minded, be watchful. Your adversary, the devil, prowls around like a roaring lion seeking someone to devour. Satan is real. And He wants our destruction. And he's always around the corner, isn't it? You've probably heard of celebrities that have had to face her into situations of stalkers, those that are always around the corner, always seeking to do them harm. So much so that a celebrity can't even be in their own home. They can't feel safe anywhere, because the stalkers around the way. How would you feel if there was a stalker that was seeking after your child? How would you feel if the safety that you want to provide for your child is threatened at all times, because there is someone out to do harm? They call and they leave threatening messages. They give you reminders all the time that they are around the corner and harm is your way? What kind of attitude would you have? How would you approach that? Would you take that lightly?

Jeremy Sweets  11:30
I know that no one here would. It's a serious situation for someone that wants our harm to be around the corner and to be present at all times. We would call the police, we would be watchful, we would tell everyone about it. Watch out there's someone that wants to do me harm, or wants to do my child harm. The text says here in first Peter five and verse eight, that we need to be watchful, be sober minded, your adversary the devil is around the corner. And this is not an innocent, harmless creature. But he's like a lion. And he's one that would devour, to destroy. Like Mark's words this morning, not one that's going to nibble a little bit, but one that will devour you. Satan is powerful, and he has a tremendous amount of power. And we need to be aware of that. We need to be watchful for that. So many people today sadly say there's no such thing as Satan. Many people today do not believe that he exists. But the harm is real, and the harm is present, and we need to be aware of it. And so Christians be watchful, be watchful, just as you would be watchful against someone threatening your child and on the alert, be watchful. Be watchful. Second Corinthians chapter two and verse 11, picking up the last part of verse 10, says, If I forgiven anything, and has been for your sake in the presence of Christ, so that we would not be outwitted by Satan, for we are not ignorant of his devices, or schemes, him his plans, we see that Satan has schemes or plans he is seeking after us, seeking after us. And so we see that we need to be aware of sight, enough his power. So many people in the world today if they do believe in Satan, they would describe the relationship something like this. God's power is equal to Satan's power. And we need to choose God over Satan. And so I think many people have this conception. And it may go along with something from Taoism, that's yin and yang, the The world is full of good and evil and it's an equal power and so we must choose what is good. Now we've already established the fact that Satan is powerful. He has a tremendous amount of power. But this is not the picture of Scripture. It is not what Scripture teaches. God's power is not on a plane or level playing with Satan whatsoever. But rather we see that God's power is greater than Satan's power, far greater than Satan's power. So as we consider the spiritual forces we should not underestimate or take lightly Satan. But neither should we overestimate his power. We need to understand that God has a tremendous amount of power. He is described as sovereign all powerful All Powerful. In Job 42. In verse two it says, I know that you can do all things, and that no purpose of yours can be for a

Jeremy Sweets  15:11
job at the end of the book acknowledges God's power, that he can do all things. In Psalm 147. In verse five, it says, great is our Lord, and abundant in power. His understanding is beyond measure. Our God is a powerful God more powerful than any one else. And First Timothy six verses 15. And 16, uses the word sovereign there. It says, He who is blessed and only sovereign, the King of kings, and Lord of LORDS, who alone has immortality, and who dwells in unapproachable light, whom no one has ever seen, or can see To Him be honored and eternal dominion. Notice that it says that he is sovereign, he has all power, He is the supreme the most ha. It also says that he is King of Kings. Yes, there are many powers in the world. But there is only one that stands head and shoulders above all of the rest, no matter how great the power is, in earthly terms. God is King of all kings, and he is Lord of all Lord. The God we serve is sovereign, is sovereign. He's not on an equal playing with Satan, but he is much greater than Satan. In fact, we see his superiority demonstrated many times in Scripture. So notice a few of these things. First of all, there's a difference between the creator and the creator. God is the Creator. The Bible says that He is the Creator of all things Colossians, one verses 16. And 17 says, For by Him, all things were created in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authority, all things were created through Him and for Him, and He is before all things and then in him all things hold together, you notice that it specifies exactly not just the things on the earth, but things in heaven, and on the earth, things that are visible and invisible. And it also says the thrones and dominions, and, and rulers and authorities. Satan is a creature. He is one that has been created, and God is the Creator. And so that demonstrates God's superiority, both of the heavenly hosts, but also also the earthly hosts, that's people and animals and all of that. God is superior, He is the Creator. We also see in Mark chapter four, Mark chapter five, turn your Bibles over to Mark chapter five, we see that Satan and demons, acknowledge the power and the authority of God. Mark five. And notice in verse six, Mark five and verse six. Now this is when Jesus comes upon the garrison, demoniac, that one possessed by a demon. And it says, And when he saw Jesus from afar, he ran and fell down before him. There's a sense here of worship, of acknowledging his superiority, verse seven, and crying out with a loud voice. He says, What have I, what have you to do with me, Jesus, Son of the Most High God, our jury, you by God do not torment me. Here, he acknowledges his position. He says, You are the most high God. Later in this text. Notice what it says in verse 10. In verse 10, it says, And he begged Him earnestly not to send them out of the country. Now a great herd of pigs was feeding there on the hillside. And they begged him saying, send us to the pigs, let us enter them. So he gave them permission, and the unclean spirits came out and entered the pigs. Do you say in this account over and over again, it acknowledges and shows us that God and Christ is superior to the demons? First of all, the demon, the man possessed by demons fell down and worshipped. And then he confessed that you are the most high Gong. And then when it came to what he was to do, he sought the permission

Jeremy Sweets  20:00
and of Jesus Christ. And it was only because Jesus gave his permission that the demons could act as they did see the demons acknowledge the authority of Almighty God. And we should, too. We see in Joe chapter to another exchange between God and the tempter, that it is God that sets the terms. In that case, God asks the tempter, have you consider my man, Joe, is integrity and his faith and even in spite of losing all of what he has. And the tempter says that he wants another trial. And he says, You may do what you will only do not take his life. It is God that is setting the terms. It is God that is sovereign, Satan has no right to act apart from what is allowed by Almighty God. God sets the terms we see in Revelation chapter 20, a picture of the end. And in that picture, we see that Satan has limited power, limited power, the text says that Satan is, and I'm going to summarize this that Satan is bound for 1000 years, he is bound up or restrained. And that seems to make sense. In my mind, I don't know that I know everything that that teaches. But I don't see the same kind of power today that we saw in the New Testament, for example, those demon possessed people, I don't see those things. And so we see this idea of this binding up, then we see this being released for a time before he would be cast into the lake of fire at the end of time. And so Satan is one that will be restrained or bound, and he will be released. But that happens at the prerogative of God. It is what God allows. And ultimately, he will be cast into the lake of fire. So Satan, I believe, has limited power, limited power. In fact, in a passage, I don't know if I wrote this down, and he calls him the ruler of this world. That same idea is found in Ephesians, chapter two in those first three verses when it calls him the prince of the power of the air. He is the ruler of this world. And so he's not only limited and, and how much power he has, but he's limited in scope isn't. He rules over this world. And it's for a time, for a time. He is limited, and he's limited by God. Not only that, but God will have the final word, God will have the final word in Second Corinthians five and verse 10. For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so that each one may receive what is due for what he has done in the body, whether good or evil. There are some people that question How can evil continue today? How can injustice persist? Why do these things happen? And those are not new questions. In the Bible, they were asking, how long is this evil going to continue? How long will injustice continue? But the truth of the matter is that it will not continue indefinitely. God is not bringing in his full force of judgment today. Because he holds out hope that there will be some that will repent. God wants all to repent. So he's not slow about coming as some people count slowness, but he wants people to repent. Second Peter, chapter three and verse nine, that's what he wants. But one day, all things will be made, right. And that's not a question mark. You know, if we had God over here and Satan over here, and they will equal powers, we wouldn't know who would win, would we? We wouldn't know the outcome. We would say we hope God wins, but maybe Satan will if they were equal, but they're not evil. Satan operates at the prerogative of God. And so God will have the final word. Justice will finally be served. And it is God that will bring judgment. God will bring judgment. So when we consider these spiritual powers, I believe we see that God is superior. God is superior.

Jeremy Sweets  24:54
What about Satan's tools, Satan's tools, Satan. Tim says to sin and He wants us to sin and he uses sin is really a tool to separate us from God. He uses the tool of suffering, the product of sin, He delights in that the product of sin is also death. We see that in Genesis chapter three, when, when the first couple sin, God says, if you eat of the tree, then you will surely die. Now he tried to say that won't happen, but that is what will happen. sin is death is the consequence of sin. It is the product of sin, it is what comes about. But another way that I see that God is sovereign is that he can even mitigate or use some of these tools against Satan himself. So when it comes to sin, we see that God provides a way of escape, a way of escape. Sin is not so powerful, that we cannot resist. Some people say that can't Don't say, I can't help it. I had to do it. You know, maybe it's wording, but I tried to get that vocabulary out of my kids. mouths, I can't, I can't do this. And I reply, yes, you can. It may be hard. It may be difficult. Saying you can do something doesn't mean that it will be easy. But the truth is, it's something you can do. Even if it doesn't seem natural. It seems natural. You know, we've spent so long serving ourselves since seems so natural in many areas, doesn't it? Selfishness is natural to us. But the truth is, we can serve God and God has provided a way of escape. So that we have the choice, will we choose the momentary pleasures of sin, or the way of escape that God has provided we do not have to sin. We do not have to sin that is our choice. Not only that, but we see that God can bring about good despite evil intentions, despite evil that might happen. In Genesis chapter 15, verse 20, you'll remember that Joseph had been sent by his brothers are sold into slavery. And in Genesis, chapter 15, verse 20, after he had come back and been revealed to them, he made this statement. As for you, you meant evil against me. But God minute for good to bring it about that many people should be kept alive as they are today. His brothers had intended to kill him. And when they changed plans, but based upon Rubens advice, then they sold him for a profit. And then they lied about it. They said to their father, that he's certainly been killed. They intended harm. They intended evil. And let me make this point clear. God didn't delight in that. I'm not saying that God wanted them to sin not that is not the case whatsoever. But when they made a choice to violate God's will, God could still use those things, according to His will and His purposes. God could bring about what is good.

Jeremy Sweets  28:39
Now Joseph had to suffer that knee because of the sins of others. But even in that suffering, God could use it to his benefit, and to His glory. Sometimes we ask questions, why is this happening to me? When we feel pain, we react emotionally we can understand that why is this happening to me? Why don't always have the answers about how God will work. But I do know God is working. And I do know what God is capable of doing. God is capable of bringing good even in the spite of our worst intentions, even in the face of our suffering. God can bring about tremendous good and we need to remember that we need to remember that. Not only that, but we see the product of suffering the product of suffering. Notice, notice in Romans chapter five, verses three through five, what can suffering produce? Seems to be something only negative it's not something I want to go through. Again, I don't enjoy pain or anything like that. But the Bible says that suffering can produce something that is good Good in us, it can develop our character. Notice in Romans five and verse three, he says not only that, but we rejoice in our suffering. Now in verse two, he says that, that we rejoice in the hope and the glory of God. And then he goes on to say, not only that we rejoice in our suffering. Now, there's many odd statements in Scripture, at least things that seem odd to us. And this is one of those that you mean to tell me that we can rejoice in suffering, that that seems like the opposite emotion that we're to have. It seems like we would want to be upset. But notice that Paul is not thinking about the here and now. Which is really fundamental to the Christian mindset we're not worried about right now. It's not our chief concern. But we see a long term vision on things. He says that we rejoice in our sufferings, knowing that suffering produces endurance, and endurance produces character, and character produces hope. And hope does not put us to shame because God's love has been poured into our hearts, through the Holy Spirit who has been given to us. When others sin against us, or when we face the the pain of life. When we continue to remain faithful to God and serve him in the face of those things, we see that we grow in our persistence. When we overcome a trial, we realize that we can keep going, this isn't something that can stop us. And so we endure, and that endurance, that, that staying after and following after God, day after day, in the ups and downs of life, produces within us a character. So that we are not thrown to and fro by the waves of sin, by the waves of trials and troubles that come our way. But we can be steadfast, and sure. And so it produces a character where we, we are going to follow God, despite our circumstances, we're not going to be tossed about by those things. And when you have that kind of character, and faith in God, it produces a hope, a confident expectation that what we are doing is not in vain. That we serve God for a reason that we will not be put to shame, but rather God will see us through pouring his love into our hearts, the Holy Spirit who has been given to us we understand and know that God will provide God will keep his word. We don't want to go through trials. We don't want to face suffering, that seems to be one of the tools of Satan. But God can use it to his benefit if we would overcome if we would overcome. I didn't know I'm going to add another point here with suffering. And that is I don't have a point on the screen for this. But that is

Jeremy Sweets  33:07
that there is an opportunity for repentance as well. When we sin, we are not zapped with death at that instance, and we don't physically die. And so if we live a lifestyle of sin, maybe there's a particular sin that we face. And if we can repent and remove ourselves from that, it may be that we can help others that struggle with that. It may be that we could use the sin that we've experienced, so that we could point others to what can change how those things can be overcome. Now again, that's, that's no reason to sin. I've heard some people say, Well, maybe I should try this just so I can see what it's like. That's not the point of Scripture. We're not to go back and want or desire sin. But the question is, what if we have experienced that and we've repented of it turned away from it? Well, we need to use our experiences for other people to help them to show them the change that can happen to show them that God is stronger, that His word is more powerful, and that repentance is possible. It is possible. Satan may have used the tool of sin against us, but we can change that and turn it in such a way that we can give glory to God. We also see the greatest the greatest reversal in Scripture. Satan thought that death was his friend. It was his major tool to be executed against others. Death separation from wrong. Nothing could be greater here than this idea of death and that was what Satan was banking on. But the text tells us God sent his son in order to die, so that others might have life and notice what it accomplished. Notice in Hebrews chapter two, Hebrews chapter two verses 14 and 15.

Jeremy Sweets  35:23
Since therefore the children share in flesh and blood, he himself likewise partook of the same things that through death, he might destroy the one who has the power of death, that is the devil, and deliver all those who through who through fear of death were subjected to lifelong slavery. Do you see what Satan was doing here? He had the power of death. And he had that with his sin. Not only that, it says that he was able to subject those that fell under his fell to lifelong slavery. That was his weapon. That was his tool, but God used his own tool against him. So that his son died, so that he could destroy the one who had power over death. And that's exactly what happened. That's why we see in First Corinthians chapter 15, when there's a question of the resurrection, we see in verses 54, and 55, it asked this question, oh, Death, where is your sting? There's a snicker, almost there, Satan, your greatest tool? Your greatest tool, your greatest weapon is, is ineffective in the face of God? Where is your power now? Where where is your stain? God has shown to be great and mighty, to be sovereign all over over all things. And so if there's a competition between God and Satan, yes, they are different, but God is superior. We need to remember that. Don't you know that makes a difference in how we live. Many people that think that that good is equal as evil, and they might not even attach God and Satan with it, they may just have this nebulous idea that good and evil are just, they're always equal, they're always going to fight it out. And we have to see which one will win. That's not the message of the Bible. The message of Scripture is that God wins. And we can have confidence in that we can put our faith in that Mike's often had the illustration, you know, when we talk about a sporting event, we don't know what we're going to do, which side are we going to root for? Which Side Are we going to pick? Well, we don't know when in physical, you know, teams when they play in sports. But we know for certain, despite all odds that God's side wins. And we need to have that confidence in that faith. So the question for you tonight is, whose side will you choose? Will you choose the momentary pleasures of sin? And a lifetime of slavery to sin and to Satan? Or will you choose victory in Christ? In First John four and verse four, it says, little children, you are from God and have overcome them. For he who is in you, is greater than he who is in the world, Which side will you choose? We also see in Romans chapter eight and verse 37. And ask the question there what can separate us from the love of Christ? What can separate us from the love of God? The text says, No, in all these things, we are more than conquerors through him who loved us. We are ones that can overcome. We are ones that can conquer and notice how we do that it is through him. We're not going to be able to overcome on our own, on our own strength, our own power, but through Jesus Christ, and in First Corinthians 15 And verse 58. It says, But thanks be to God who gives us victory through our Lord Jesus Christ. I don't think that verses right, because I know First Corinthians 1515. That's not it. But it's in First Corinthians 15. Okay. There it says, But thanks be to God who gives us victory through our Lord Jesus Christ. As we look at these passages, and we ask who sigh will you choose? Do you want to be on the winning side or the losing side? Do you want to be an overcomer, a conqueror and one who has victory? Or do you want to be on the side of Satan? It's your choice. And it's a serious choice. It is a matter of life and death. If you're here tonight and you're not a Christian, you have an opportunity to obey the invitation to To honor the invitation that God gives to you, you can believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, you can repent of your sins and turn away from a lifestyle of sin to a lifestyle of service. You can make that lifetime commitment,

Jeremy Sweets  40:15
you can confess that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living God, and you can be baptized into water for their forgiveness of your sins. When you do that you're putting to death the old man, you're saying, I'm changed on change to the power of God, I'm putting that to death. I'm not going to live a life of sin anymore. And when you're buried with him and water and raised to walk, you're raised to walk in newness of life, a new life, a new mind, a new commitment, a new Master, what a glorious picture that is, and that's your opportunity. If you're not a Christian, if you're here tonight, and you are a Christian, when you were baptized, you made a lifelong commitment. And if you're not honoring that and not living as you should you have an opportunity tonight as well, to make a change. There's any subject to the invitation please come as we stand and sing at this time.
