Well, good evening to all of you. It's good to see you all. And I'm grateful for this opportunity to come and speak with you about something from the epistles of the apostle Paul, some things that Paul would have us know, it's a great topic. And I'm grateful for the opportunity to have a part in that. You have been kindly invited me many times to come and speak. And I appreciate always the opportunity and appreciate all of you in the fine congregation here in the good work that you continue to do. Especially appreciate your work in Moldova, and supporting the men that are there that has been a work near and dear to my heart for many years, I first made a trip there in 1995. And so I have followed on that through the years and visited there many times. And I know that the people there love and appreciate you for your help and sharing with them and the preaching of the Gospel there with Sergei and others. And so thank you for your continued interest in that. Several years ago, while I was on a return trip. From there, I had the occasion to visit the British Library in London, I had come back to London with the purpose of visiting the British Museum and going through the antiquities of that museum and taking photos that I could use in teaching. And also, I wanted to visit the British Library, which is just a couple of blocks away, which houses

Johnny Felker  01:33
two of the oldest existing Greek manuscripts of the New Testament, the Codex Alexandrinus, and the Codex, Sonny Atticus. And it was a it was a joy to stand there and to see those wonderful manuscripts that are well over 1500 years old, and some of the oldest copies of the scripture that we have in the fullest form. But at the music at the library, you can also see some other things have of historical interest. And among them, were are, for example, the autographs of some of the English poets and writers like, for example, Shakespeare, or original copies of one of the most important historical documents of the Western civilization, the Magna Carta, and there you can actually see original copies with the seals of King John, that declared that that were issued forth when that declaration was made by the king. Some of you may remember from your historical studies that the Magna Carta, or more fully described in Latin as Magna Carta liber totham. The great charter of the liberties was a historical document authorized by King John that granted certain liberties to the English barons, and which established historical precedent for later discussions about personal liberty. And it has been characterized as one of the greatest constitutional documents of all times the foundation of the freedom of the individual, against the arbitrary authority of the despot. Tonight, our lesson comes from an epistle of the apostle Paul, which discusses what is an even greater freedom than that. And this book has been called the Magna Carta, of Christian liberty. I'm talking tonight about Paul's Epistle to the Galatians. And if Paul were living today, he would want us to know I think about this wonderful topic of our freedom, or our liberty in Christ. And also he would want us to know how to live out that liberty in our or that freedom in our daily lives. And so tonight, that's what we're going to talk about for a little bit. And I invite you to take your Bible in hand as we look at the book of Galatians. And particularly, our primary texts will be from Galatians, chapter five, and six. But before we look at our texts, it might be helpful to establish a context for our study. And so I want to just kind of quickly page through this wonderful letter. If you have your Bible in hand, just turn back the wheel for a moment to Galatians chapter one, and we're just going to take out really rapid survey of the message so we can put our our pastors tonight in context, I believe that it is defensible to say, and they're very views about that. And that's the reason I put it that way that Paul wrote Galatians to the disciples that he had made on his first first preaching journey, they were the Christians living in the cities of, of Lystra and Iconium. And, and Derby, at this time known as provincial go Leisha apparently after Paul had taught the gospel their course along with Barnabas, so his first journey Judaizing teachers had come among them or arisen among them, and told them that they must not only believe in Jesus as the Messiah of the Old Testament scriptures, but they must also keep the Law of Moses in order to be saved, including among those commands the command to be circumcised. And it would appear from Paul's response that they had sought to undermine what Paul had done by calling into question the legitimacy of both his apostleship and the teaching that he had given among them. And thus, it became necessary for Paul to write this letter to the Galatians, to give an in depth defense of both his apostolic calling and his message that he had taught there, among the Galatians. And so as we page through for just a moment, we just simply would say that the first two chapters could be entitled in defense of the Messenger of freedom. And in these chapters, chapters one and two, Paul establishes that his message did not come from men, but rather from God, and that he was not dependent upon even the Jerusalem apostles for his apostleship, or the content of his message. And furthermore, he reveals that his gospel received the full endorsement of the pillars of the Jerusalem church, James, and sleepers and John. And so in this way, he answers those who might say that Paul was not a real apostle, or that that his message was somehow another suspect. And so Paul begins by defending himself as the messenger of the gospel, we might call the next two chapters, chapters, three and four, at least through the first part of chapter four, in defense of the message of freedom. And in these chapters, Paul presents a series of, of compelling arguments derived from the law, which are intended to convince the Galatians that his message that he had taught them that they had received from him was the true gospel, and that there was, in fact, no other basis for salvation other than the masters that he had taught them when he came among them on his first journey. And he grounds his arguments in God's previous revelation in the Old Testament, as well as as their experience in the aftermath of their conversion as they received the Holy Spirit and all the blessings that came from that. And that leads us to our section tonight that we're looking at the third section, we might call applying the message of freedom, Paul is calling the Galatians to action, he's calling upon him to respond to what he has said, in these first four chapters, he calls upon them to remember the relationship they have had with him, to remove these false teachers who have sought to enslave them to the law, and most importantly, to stand fast in the liberty that they possessed through the gospel, and to think more critically about the changes that they've made and the ones that have caused them to make them. And so in the first half of this final section, Paul, the theme, I think, is well expressed in Galatians five, verse one, it was for freedom, that Christ set us free, therefore, keep standing firm, and do not be subjected again, to a yoke of slavery. And so Paul's first concern and the final sections he applies the message is to insist that they not listen to these false teachers, the Judaizers, who are telling them they must add something to the gospel or that and that undermine the gospel liberty that Paul contends that they have and has taught that they have. But now Paul shifts in the latter part of the section to a different concern. The question is, how will those who have trusted in the righteousness that comes by grace, through faith conduct themselves will they allow their freedom from below to cause them to live contrary to the moral principles of the law? Will being under Grace lead them to live a fleshly license, God's grace is available to them. And so Paul is concerned that insisting that they're free from the law might lead some to resort to a less sensuous way of life, believing that somehow another their freedom means they can live a life of sin. And so let's hear what Paul has to say. If you will read with me now as we begin Dan in Galatians five, and we'll read a rather lengthy section here just to get a full context for our study. Paul writes, For you were called to freedom brethren, only do not turn your freedom into an opportunity for the flesh, but through love serve one another. For the whole law is fulfilled in one word in the statement you shall love your neighbor as yourself. But if you buy it into via one another, take care lest you be consumed by one another. But I say, walk by the Spirit, and you will not carry out the desire of the flesh for the flesh such as desire against the Spirit and Spirit against the flesh. For these are in opposition to one another, so that you may not do the things that you please but if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law. Now the deeds of the flesh are evident, which are immorality, impurity, sensuality, idolatry, sorcery, enmities, strife, jealousy, outbursts of anger, disputes, dissensions, factions in the in drunkenness, carousing in themes like these, of which I forewarn you just as I have for warned you that those who practice such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God. But Paul goes on to say the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self control, against such things, there is no law. Now those who belong to Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions, and desires. So as we read that passage there, I want us to think about this idea tonight of how the Christian lives out his liberty in Christ. Clearly in this section, Paul's emphasis has changed. And he wants the Galatians to understand what they should do in the practice of their freedom from the law, what that means about the way they live their lives. And so we're going to focus in particularly on Galatians, chapter five, and verse,

Johnny Felker  12:26
verse 13 513. So here's what Paul says to them. He wants them to understand, and he would want us to understand that the believer in Christ is free, he is a free, he is spiritually free. But this freedom must not be turned into an opportunity to live according to the flesh. Let's break that down. Let's unpack that a little bit. Paul begins you were call to freedom, brethren. The Gospel call God's call through the gospel is a call to spiritual freedom. And this freedom is affirmed in the teaching of the apostles throughout the New Testament. Consider, for example, a couple of quotes from the book of acts as the apostles went about teaching people in the various cities where they travel, they tried to stress to those that they were teaching that they are free. They are free man through the gospel. For example, Paul in his synagogue sermon, and acts 13, right or spoke, therefore, let it be known to you, brethren, that through him that is through Christ, forgiveness of sins is proclaimed to you. And through him, everyone who believes is freed from all things, which you could not be freed through the law of Moses. And so Paul said that to the Jews, and the God fearing Gentiles, they're in the synagogue in any city of their x 13 appear likewise in the discussion about whether or not the Gentiles should be circumcised that arose, you remember, and is recorded in Acts chapter 15. made this statement. Now? Therefore, why do you put God to the test by placing upon the neck of the disciples a yo now notice the language, a yo? A symbol of slavery, which neither our fathers nor we have been able to bear, but we believe that we have been saved through the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, in the same way as they also are, that is, Jews and Gentiles say the same way through faith in Jesus Christ. And so Paul wants us to understand that we are free, that we are free in Christ, but this freedom must be carefully defined. We are not free to do as we please sometimes when people hear this idea of Christian freedom, it almost seems to be permission to do whatever they want. And there are no restrictions that we are free to do whatever we want, and God will be happy with that. And it is not freedom to do as we please it is not freedom from God's authority, it is not cut us loose from from a standard of authority. And it is not freedom in that sense. It is freedom from the law, as a basis for salvation, as we heard from these passages, and it is freedom then from the sand that results from a failure to keep law perfectly. And it is a freedom from the eternal consequences of a failure to keep the law perfectly. And so it is a real spiritual freedom that we enjoy, and we need to, we need to cherish it, we need to appreciate it. And we need to understand what made it possible and that is the grace of God, and the sacrifice that Jesus made in our behalf through that grace, and the faith that we have put in that sacrifice. So if Paul were here today, he'd want us to know that in Christ, we are spiritually free. But we must understand how to live out that freedom. And that is the essence of our passage here. So Paul says, going back to our Tech's Galatians 513, you were called a freedom brethren, only do not turn your freedom into an opportunity for the flesh. The freedom of salvation by grace, can and has been abused as, as we can see, often in Scripture, the prospect of God's continuing forgiveness through grace may be interpreted as permission to not worry about sin in our lives, or even as license to continue in sin without repentance, as if to say, well, I know I'm in God's Grace, God is going to forgive me. So why worry about sin, it's going to be forgiven, uncovered by the grace of God. And Paul addresses this in many of his epistles. In fact, he in the book of Romans, begins chapter six, by talking about how that we need to be cautious in how we view grace. And he says, Shall we continue in sin that grace may abound? And of course you remember the answer in the King James, God forbid, or in the newer translations? May it never be maybe a little more accurate translation, that the accusation that teaching Grace leads to life of sin stands behind the slanderous statements somebody made about Paul's Gospel, they they accused Paul, of giving people permission to sin, because he taught that we are saved by grace, and not by not by the law. And so Paul enrolments again, answers that and why not say he said is we're slanderously reported and some affirm that we say let us do evil, that good makeup horse Paul never taught anything like that. And he said, their condemnation is just Jude describes false teachers who encouraged people to pervert gospel freedom. He tells us in Jude verse for certain persons have crept in unnoticed. Those who were long beforehand marked out for this condemnation, ungodly persons, who turned the grace of God into less sensuousness and deny our only mastering Lord Jesus Christ. In other words, the false teacher was saying, it's not going to matter about the problem of sand or committing sand because God's grace is going to cover it. And so it gives people permission to do pretty well what they want to do, and always rely upon this idea that well, God will forgive me, that's my backstop, I can live a life of sin, and God will, God will consequently be obligated to forgive me. Likewise, Peter, similarly describes false teachers who promise freedom to people but really only simply Rhian slave those that they teach to sinful desires in First and Second Peter to He also mentions this idea for speaking out arrogant words of vanity. They enticed by fleshly desires by sensuality, those who barely escaped from the ones who live in error, promising them freedom, while they themselves are slaves of corruption. For what by whatever a man is overcome by this he isn't sweet. Ironically, those who sought to promote freedom by abusing Grace simply end up making people slaves to sin all over again the the objective But the gospel is not to keep us in sand, but to save us from sin to deliver us out of it. And this approach to Grace ultimately recaptures, those who buy into the false doctrine that they're that God's grace can be used as an opportunity for the flesh. And so Paul forbids any rationale for allowing Christian freedom to be turned into an opportunity for the flesh. And so that's what he says specifically in this verse. And that is, do not use your freedom as an opportunity for the flesh. The flesh, of course, refers to that a part of man's nature that is attracted to sin because of the physical or even maybe the psychological satisfaction it brings. And Paul wants us to understand that sins that come from following this sinful impulse called the flesh must be put away by the Christian, that that that should be his goal to remove these things from his life, and so that we understand exactly what he means. What kind of things is he talking about? He gives us one of these sin list that make it very clear to us what walking after the flesh involves, and he says the deeds of the flesh are evident. no mystery here, you can easily identify them they are manifest so that one will know when they are being practiced. They are immorality, that is fornication, sexual relationships among the unmarried or also uncomprehending adultery, sexual relationships, unlawful sexual relationships among the marry impurity, and sensuality or less seriousness, idolatry, sorceries, enmities, strife, and jealousy outbursts of anger and disputes and dissensions and factions, and envying and drunkenness, and carousing, and things like these. And so Paul says, These things have no place in the Christians life, that grace is not the permission to practice these things. Our freedom in Christ does not grant us permission to practice these things. I was someone the other day was telling me a story about, about someone who appeared a lady who appeared on Bachelorette, some of me and read this article about the preacher, man, Ken Welliver. And the discussion had to do with the fact that that

Johnny Felker  22:39
on the show, of course, as you were calling, I don't watch the show, by the way, I want to make sure you understand that. But the the idea was the bachelorette entertains or dates, these various men, you know, to try to decide which one she wants to choose. Well, one of those young man said that he would be very troubled, if he found out that she was, we're in mixed company, I'll just simply say, sleeping around with some of the other guys that that would be a that would be a, that would be a relationship killer for him. And he, he thought it was important for one to keep his relationship pure, and not be involved sexually with someone before marriage. Well, as it turns out, this and this, by the way, is featured in the advertisements for this particular upcoming show, as I understand it, and it she became quite offended by the idea and suggested that she had a relationship with Jesus, and that took care of such things. And so if she, in fact, slept around with several young men, then that would be okay, because the Lord covers that he, he loves her, and he'll forgive her for these kinds of things that she does now is that what Paul had in mind, is that the kind of freedom that we're supposed to be practicing, it seems to me that is exactly what Paul said, must not be done. And that is to proceed in a way of life. That presumes that you can do whatever you want, and you can engage in immoral activity. And you kind of leave that provision back there that whatever you do, God's grace is going to cover it. And so instead of trying to live a life of purity and holiness, she simply accepts Grace and her relationship with Jesus as a permission to live and do what she essentially wants to do. I said, and, but that's an exactly a modern example of the kind of thing that we can see all around us. And preachers will tell people that you know that God accepts you as you are, you can live the way you want, and it's all good with God as long as you say you believe in him. That's not what the gospel teaches. And that's not what Paul taught in this passage. He made that very clear.

Johnny Felker  24:51
And so how easy is it to open that door that says, Since God's grace will cover me, I don't have to be concerned about how I live for From the law, or the continuing access to God's grace must never be never become to us a pretext to live a fleshly life, whether that be through the abuse of others and anger is this passage talks about or sexual immorality, or drunkenness and the various forms that might take or or religious sin. This is not where we need to be going with the biblical concept of grace. And so Paul wants that provision clearly in the minds of the Galatians. He wants them to understand that their free buddy urges them not to turn their freedom into an opportunity for the flesh. But now Paul shows us the contrasting and correct approach to freedom and grace, you are called to freedom bread, and only do not use your turn your freedom and an opportunity for the flesh, but through love, serve one another. The impetus for righteous living under grace is not the authority of the law, per se, but rather the impulse of love in our hearts. That comes from believing the spirits gospel message, and that love is twofold it is toward God on the one hand, and it is toward our fellow man on the other hand, and here, of course, Paul stresses the ladder, it stands at the head, this love stands at the head of a whole, I guess you could call it spiritual cornucopia of fruit that the spirit seeks to produce in us. Instead of producing in us this ungodly set of works of the flesh, the spirit through the gospel have a different objective. He wants to create it within us a Christ like attitude and demeanor which he enumerates in this form, and Galatians 522, the fruit of the Spirit is love and joy and peace and patience and kindness and goodness, and faithfulness and gentleness and self control. This is supposed to be the product of the gospel in the life of the Christian, this is what God had in mind. This is what the Spirit seeks to and will produce. So Paul's point is that embracing and faith, the spirits message of God's love, will renew and transform the inner man not cause us to continue to live a life of fleshly indulgence, but rather, will change the way we are inside. and foremost, of course, will be the fruit of love in our heart for God and for one another. And so Paul says, don't use your freedom as an opportunity for the flesh, but rather through love, serve one another. Service is last action, to experience the love of God and His gracious forgiveness is likewise to extend his love to others and serving them. If we have fully appreciated what God has done for us and loving us and forgiving us, then that love should flow through us to others and cause us to act in the same way toward them to live out God's love toward others as

Johnny Felker  28:31
we have received it from him. And this, of course, is what the New Testament stresses and service is loves action. And it's interesting that Paul chooses to use the same word formerly in this text translated bondage, as if to say, you are free in Christ. And yet Paul says, act as if you are a servant or a slave of one another to use your love to serve those that are around you that that is the true freedom. And there's kind of an irony in that, that in our freedom. We choose to serve. And that's what the Lord did. And that's what he wants us to do. And service is loves action. As Paul continues the text he will tell us of course. Later in the letter, how the believer outwardly expresses this love Paul gives us two portraits of the Spirit led life He gives us an internal portrait, love, joy, peace, patience. That's the inner man that he believes will result from hearing the message of God's love and appropriating it in our lives. But on the other hand, he also shows us an outer expression. And as he continues the letter, he will show us that what it meant To serve one another, how do we do that he will tell us first of all that we need to refrain from competitive behavior. We truly have the love of God, and the love of brethren and our heart, we're not in a contest with others, to envy them and challenge them. And let those fleshly desires rule the way we relate to one another. But rather, we will refrain from that competitive behavior. When we see a brother, that is an error, who has fallen, by the way, we will love him and care for him. And we'll do all we can to restore him back and put him back in his proper place. He would your spiritual restore such a one in a spirit of gentleness or maintenance, considering yourself Galatians six, one and two, it will manifest itself in burying one another's burdens, recognizing that we all will sometimes have heavy loads to carry. And we'll need somebody to come along with us and bear those burdens with us. And that is the evidence of the Spirit led life, the person who will serve his brethren, who will look for occasion to help them carry the loads that life has laid upon them. Paul goes on to say that such a person will have fellowship with those who teach in all good things. And then he will urge us to do good unto all men, and especially into them of the household of the faith. In other words, what Paul does in Galatians is, is fill out how to live out our laws in Christ, and how to show that we are really spirit led people on the inside and the outside. Did you notice that Paul did not suggest to us that the evidence of spirit led life is some miraculous display. Nor is it some feeling of interleading that we imagined some voices telling us to do this or to do that. But rather he gives us objective and clear manifestations of what it means to be led by the Spirit, to have inner attitudes that are Christ light, and outer attitudes that are Christ like that show us that we love people and we want to serve them in the various ways that he has described. When love is absent, a different way of life manifests itself.

Johnny Felker  32:30
And that of course, is that it will result in biting and devouring those who lacked love will start living like animals, dividing and bark, devouring, biting and devouring one another. And of course, living by the law of the jungle, so to speak, will not only result in the in the destruction of, of God's people, the destruction of a local congregation, how many times have we seen that happen, where fleshly desires arise among people and they argue and they fight and they fall out with one another and, and the Law of the Jungle prevails, there's competition and challenging one another. And the result, of course, is destruction. So Paul warns, if we allow the flesh to dominate our attitudes, it has destructive consequences for the church, as well. And he goes on to tell us as we will finish our reading here for the whole law, his full field and one word in the statement, you shall love your neighbor as yourself. And so without being under the law, per se, Paul wants us to see that the believer can accomplish its moral demands, simply by loving his neighbor as himself, I feel that sometimes the probably those who came among the Galatians, But labored under this kind of assumption that if you that there are really only two alternatives, you either either keep the law or you live an immortal life. And Paul says, No, there's a third category, walked by the Spirit, and you'll not fulfill the desires of the flesh, but neither will you be under the law. And so he would carve out a different category for the people of God, to let the power of the Spirit work in us through the gospel, creating within us these inner attitudes, and these outer expressions, all of which demonstrate and give meaning to our our freedom in Christ. And so Paul wants us if he were here today, he might want to talk about some of these evangelists that you hear on TV that tell you that you're good with God, no matter what you do. Just show up at church, celebrate him and his grace and then go out and live however you want. Is that what the Bible teaches? Not at all. It's very popular religion in our culture, very popular. People love like a religion that says I don't have to change people like a religion that says I can do, I can hold on to my pet sins, and I don't have to get rid of those. But that is not grace. That's walking according to the flesh. Now, when I say all these things, I don't mean to say that Christians have to be perfect. I don't mean to say that you'll not have times when you disappoint God, I know I do, and do things or ought not do. But our attitude should be one in which we fight against sin, that we do not welcome the opportunity and provide for it. But rather, we tried to become more like the Lord every day and to let the Spirit accomplish what he intends to accomplish, by letting God's love fill our hearts and let it work out in the way that we deal with others in our life, every day. And so if Paul were here, I believe he'd want us to know those things. Let's think quickly now.

Johnny Felker  36:01
Four or five lessons, I think, come clear to us through this passage tonight, that first of all, God's grace, must not must never become the rationale for sinful living. That idea has already caused too much damage in our culture. Secondly, to receive God's gracious love, is to manifest it toward others. If you have been forgiven, you need to forgive. If your Savior came and served you by dying on the cross. You need to serve, you need to live out the attitudes that he has shown toward you that that is what our faith is all about living like Jesus. Thirdly, quarrels and divisions among the people of God are the evidence of a lack of love and appreciation for his grace. If we have appreciated what he has done for us, that we likewise appreciate what he's done for the guy next to us in the pew. And we need to be at peace with one another in harmony with one another, and helpful be helpful to one another. Fourthly, serving loving service to others, is the evidence of true love and appreciation of God's gracious forgiveness. When we truly embrace the message of God's love and His forgiveness through Jesus Christ, then, while we are free from the demands of the law, we are at the same time, slaves of Jesus Christ and of one another, to help show our love to one another in every way possible. Finally, preaching true grace, which is so important in our culture, will preserve the cause of Christ, but failure to practice it will destroy the very thing that Christ died to create. So I appreciate you listening to me tonight about this topic is not one that we would ordinarily think about. But I believe that Paul, we're here today, he would want us like he wanted the Galatians. To appreciate the freedom that we have in Christ. And also, at the same time, know how to live out that freedom in our life, every day God has called upon us to live a beautiful life, a life of unrestrained, unrestricted love, no law will stop you from rising to the zenith of your power, to love and to have joy and to have peace. And all of that is a part of the unlimited freedom that God has made possible for each of us through the sacrifice of this son, I hope that we experienced that every day, I just simply will lead you to this question. What have you done with your freedom? In Christ? Are you failed were those fruits of the spirit of I may think of it in the plural love and joy and peace and patience and kindness. Are you are you showing externally the evidence of your love for your brethren and

Johnny Felker  39:14
these actions that Paul talks about burying burdens, restoring the airing, sharing with those who teach and, and doing good going about your life everyday looking for opportunity to serve to help because this is the lie to which to which the Lord has called us. Finally, I was asked to extend an invitation. So I'll do that now. Just think about what Jesus has done to deliver us from sin, that he came to this earth and he said, The Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve. That's why He came. He came to serve you and me, and with a service of the profound a sacrifice to give his life the Scripture says, a ransom for many. The Lord Jesus did that for every person in this room and he calls upon all of us, to come to him in appreciation for that great sacrifice to trust in it as the only hope of not only forgiveness of sins, but victory over it. And so tonight if you struggle with sin in your life and you want to be free, there is an answer there is a solution. It is not through your own self effort, or devotion to good works. It is to embrace the love of God through Jesus Christ and the Spirit. And let that message fill your heart and shape you and turn you into the person that God wants you to be so that you are born again that you are new, inside out and your whole life will be changed and transformed. As you receive God's forgiveness and began your journey to follow him would there be someone who would be free from the burden of sin as the song says, There's power in the blood, there's power in the blood, and tonight if we can assist you and procreating, that great sacrifice come tonight in faith in Jesus Christ, repenting of the sin in your life, and upon the confession of your faith. Be baptized in his name and you will receive you will be made free from sin that will be put behind you and you will begin a new life in which you are guided by the principle of love. And living out that principle will shape and transform you into a Christ light life that will result in service to others. And most importantly, the opportunity to be in heaven with God forevermore. We can help you tonight to to make that decision and and obey the Lord, which come now as we stand together. And as we say
