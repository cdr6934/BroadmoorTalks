Good morning. It's good to see everyone here today, it's certainly good that we can come here and worship God. Our goal of Broadmoor is to give God glory and praise and all things. The most important thing we have in this life is not a possession. It's not a thing. But it's our relationship with God. And so we're striving to proclaim the gospel to tell other people about, about Jesus and their need for God, and also to grow in our relationship with Him. We pray to live godly lives not only here, but as we leave this place, so that we might give God glory. In all things. don't often do series, but I kind of started something. So I guess I'm gonna finish it. So we looked at first Corinthians chapter 12. Looking at the unity we had within there, the diversity of gifts that were given. And then chapter 13, talking about love and the need for love and that discussion, and I'd like to simply continue that lesson this morning, as we look at edifying worship. This will serve as the conclusion to Paul's argument in chapter 12 through 14 as he talks about the issue that they were having with worship. Sometimes when discussions of worship come up, we see that people can delve into matters that are unimportant, and they fight and bicker about those things. Often selflessness is at play, as we see here in First Corinthians chapter 12, through 14. But Paul points us to fundamental facts of who we are as Christians, and how that should guide us in everything that we do, including and especially worship. Let me simply run through the things that we've discussed so far. In first Corinthians chapter 12. And the first three verses, we see the purpose of the gifts and the spiritual things that were given for the Corinthians. And that is that they might proclaim that Jesus is Lord. That was the fundamental message of those gifts as they reveal God's word to other people. But that fundamental truth also would help them as they exercise these gifts, recognizing that Jesus is Lord. That's true today, we need that in our preaching and teaching today as well. Paul is going to remind them that they have a variety of gifts, there are many gifts that were given to the people, and they had functions, different functions there. But all of that was given by one God, for one purpose, for the building up in the edifying of the Body of Christ. And so even though there were differences there at the church, as far as what they were doing with these gifts, and the gifts that they had, they were all united in their purpose, and in the one that they were serving.

Jeremy Sweets  02:52
We also see as we continue on that Paul is going to use an analogy of the body, just as there is one body, and many members. So it is for the church, which is the body of Christ, the church has many different members. And they may have different functions, they may have different abilities, they may have different contributions to the body. But even though there's those differences, they're all still one body. And so it is with the church, even though there are different things that we contribute to the body, each one each member is necessary. Each member is important. Each one should be valued. And Paul says they are all part of that one body. He then talks about God's appointments in the church, he's given apostles and prophets, evangelists, teachers, and then he talks about the gifts that he's given. And he says that God has given these things to the church for the benefit of the church, again, underscoring the fact that these things come from God, it is God's wisdom, as he appointed these things. But he also orders the gifts there are certain gifts that are better in terms of what they can accomplish than others. It appears that the church at Corinth was fighting and bickering over be able to speak in tongues, and they value that above everything else. And Paul says that's important, but it plays a role and you need to understand that. And so he mentions that in those appointments as well. He says, but let me show you a better way. A better way than fighting and bickering and trying to promote yourself in worship. A better way is love. Love is an absolute necessity. You can do a lot of good things, a lot of spiritual things. But if you don't have love, then those things don't profit you they're of no benefit to you. You can't be a child of God and do spiritual matters and leave out what is fundamental to being a Christian. What is fundamental to the heart of God and that is love. So if we are Christians, followers of Christ, children of God, led by the Spirit, then we will have love at the heart of what we're doing. It will be the basis of our actions and all things, and worship included. He then talks about the character of love, love is not a feeling. Love is an action. Love is a commitment. And it's one that we make to other people love primarily serves others, it does not serve self. Now there's some sense in which we have a love for ourselves and a caring concern for ourselves. But God calls us to loving other people before ourselves. He goes on to talk about the fact that love is permanent. Now, there are certain gifts that are temporary, but love is permanent. And so he points them to the permanence there of love. And that brings us to chapter 14, where there are really two sections that we'll talk about this morning. The first one is the superiority of prophecy. So he's been leading up to the issue laying some groundwork, but as he gets into 14, he really deals with the issue, the problem that they were having. And he says that prophecy is superior to tones, and he's going to give some reasons for that. And then he also talks about how they can carry out their worship in a decent and orderly way and why they need to carry it out in that manner. So that's what we're going to look at this morning. I'm glad you're here with with me open up your Bibles to First Corinthians chapter 14, if you haven't already done so. Paul says in first Corinthians 14 And verse one, Pursue love and earnestly desire the spiritual things or spiritual gifts, especially that you may prophesy. In these first five verses, he is going to compare and contrast tongues and prophecy. Now why should they see prophecy above the exercising of tongues, he says, prophecy can be more beneficial. And he discusses that in verses two through four specifically, notice what he says in verse two.

Jeremy Sweets  07:25
For one who speaks in a tongue speaks not to men but to God, for no one understands him, but he utters mysteries in the spirit. One on the other hand, the one who prophesies speaks to people for their building, and encouragement and consolation. The one who speaks in a tongue builds up himself, but the one who prophesies builds up the church. So again, we see that God had given in the first century, the church, their gifts, abilities that were beyond their natural abilities. Two of these that were involved, were speaking in tongues, that meant that they would be able to speak in a language that they had not studied. Another one was prophecy or being able to speak forth the Word of God. And so those are the gifts that he's comparing. Now, there are many other gifts we've seen in First Corinthians 12, and elsewhere. But these are the two that he is going to compare and contrast. Notice what he says about tongues. He says, the one that speaks in tongues speaks to God, He speaks to God and He's not understood by another. And in this he builds up himself, particularly as they were exercising this trying to speak in a tongue in order to impress others. And that meant that there was often no one to interpret. So they were simply speaking in a foreign language. Would it? do you any good if I got up here and started speaking in Korean? If I started speaking in another language, and I just carried on, would that benefit you? And so he says, speaking in tongues as someone where you're speaking to God, you're not really speaking other people. And that's not understood. But notice what he says about prophecy. One who prophesies and a language that everyone would know, would be able to speak to other people. And he would do that for building up and notice the language that he uses there. As he says that in verse three for up building or building up, encouragement, consolation, you see the benefits, the good that these words do, as they are relate to other people, and the result is that the church would be edified. The church would be built up. If I spent my entire lesson talking in Korean or Latin or any other language that you didn't understand. You would not derive benefit from that. But as I get up and speak to the language that we understand and speak forth the Word of God that can provide Great benefit, as we see and hear and understand those words. And so that's what he talks about in those first five verses. In verse five, let me conclude this section by reading that. Now. Not I want you to. He says, Now I want you all to speak in tongues, but even more to prophesy. The one who prophesies is greater than the one who speaks in tongues unless someone interprets, so that the church may be built. And so he says, prophecy is better because of this. What it provides tongues are still important, especially when combined with interpretation. But he mentioned the prophecy is superior. Okay, well notice the next few verses in verses six through nine, he's going to talk about the impact that these two things have upon Christians. Notice in verses 10 and 11, verses 10 and 11. He says, someone speaking on another language is really a foreigner to the hearer. If I were to speak in Korean, you don't speak that it's gonna be foreign to you, you're not going to understand it. Notice what he says in verse 10.

Jeremy Sweets  11:18
There are doubtless many different languages in the world, and none is without meaning. But if I do not know the meaning of the language, I will be a foreigner to the speaker and the speaker a foreigner to me. How do you feel when you go into another country? Or if you've ever had that experience, in a place where other people are speaking a different language that you don't understand? How do you feel? Do you feel at home? Do you feel like you are at home? The answer is no. You feel like a foreigner, you don't understand maybe the cultures, the customs and the language. And that's a big part of how you would feel. And so he says that if I were to speak tongues, and no one's there to interpret, I would be a foreigner to you, and you would be a foreigner to me. And the result is that there would be no building up that would take place. Now on the other side, and he doesn't spell this out, but what is the opposite of being a foreigner, I use the word their family. And that reminds me of the fact that the church is brothers and sisters in Christ working together. So we are not to be foreigners with one another. Rather, we are to be family. And the result is that we should be instructed in what we are doing. Notice what he says in verse 12. So with yourself, since you're eager for manifest manifestations of the Spirit, strive to excel in building up the church, that should be what you strive for what you're trying to accomplish. Again, he says in verse 13, therefore, one who speaks in a tongue should pray that he may interpret, and the reason is so that others can understand. And finally in verse 19, with this section, nevertheless, in church, I would rather speak five words with my mind in order to instruct others than 10,000 words and tone. I would rather teach and instruct than simply show off, or simply speak in another language. We see as we continue further in verses 20 through 25. He continues to contrast with tongues and prophecy, and now he's going to talk about unbelievers. What if an unbeliever came into your assembly? What would that look like? What would happen there? Notice what he says in verse 24 and 25. If an unbeliever heard prophecy, it says he is. I got the wrong verse there. Let me look before that in verse 22. Verse 23, says, If therefore the whole church comes together and all speak in tongues and outsiders are unbelievers inter will they not say that you're out of your minds? What if someone came in here and we were speaking another language? We're all just sitting here? And no one was understanding? What would someone say about that? That doesn't make sense. I don't understand what you're doing. I can't comprehend. You're out of your minds, you're out of your mind. That's what an unbeliever a non Christian would say if they came into the assembly. But on the flip side of that, what would happen if an unbeliever heard the word of God in a way that they could understand if they heard prophecy? Well, then they would be convicted. notice verses 24 and 25. He is convicted by all he is called to account by all the secrets of his heart are disclosed. And so falling on his face he will worship God and declare that God is really among you. One could hear the Word of God, they would recognize they're the source. And the result would be that one could be convicted, one could be held into account for their sins based upon what God's Word says. And it says that they could fall on their face and worship, they could be brought by those words to a point of humility, a recognition of their need for God and they could worship God. Now, that won't happen every time. But the word of God can produce that if it's understood. And I think that's what Paul is saying. And so we see this contrast between the tongues and the gifts of prophecy in these first 25 verses, is going to say in verse 12, strive to excel and building up the church. And again, in verse 19, I would rather speak five words that can be understood than 10,000 in a tongue prophecy is better. And that's his point in those first 25 verses for the reasons that he mentions. Okay? Does that make sense? You see where we're tracking with this passage.

Jeremy Sweets  16:09
And verses 26 through 40, he's going to deal with a different subject, a related subject, but he's going to talk about some, some rules, some ways to implement these things that would make it beneficial for all he states in verse 26, of this chapter, the goal, what they're trying to accomplish, what then brothers, when you come together, each one has a him a lesson, a revelation, a tongue, or an interpretation. Let all things be done for building up. The goal of these gifts would be that the church could be instructed and built up, encouraged, consolation could come. The goal is that the church would grow and be built up. And so he sets that out at the very front here. Next, he is going to provide some instructions, some instructions for edifying worship, some rules to follow some things to put in place in order that they could edify. If edifying is the goal, what does that look like practically speaking? Well, a few things might be mentioned. Notice in verse 27, verse 27,

Jeremy Sweets  17:26
says, If any speak at a tone, let there be only two or three and each in turn, and again in verse 31, for you can all prophesy one by one, so that all may learn and all may be encouraged? The first rule, he says is take turns prophesying, and only do it one at a time. Now that make sense doesn't? wouldn't do you any good? And we have three preachers here, would it? do you any good if Conrad stood here, and Mike stood here? And we all gave our lesson at the same time? That would be confusing, wouldn't it? Who would you be listening to or this person would make that point, it would not make a lot of sense, it makes much more sense to go one at a time doesn't to be able to speak the word of God, that's the best way that it can be understood. He goes on to say that you need to let someone interpret at the end of verse 27, after he says to take your turn, he says and let someone interpret. If I were to speak in another language, which we've actually had in this pulpit, we've we've had a Spanish speaker calm, we've had someone that from a that we have supported in the field, and they work related that word to us with an interpreter. And so they were able to speak in their tongue, but we could understand through the interpretation. So he says, If you want to edify, make sure the word is interpreted, interpreted. Next, he says, let the men or the leaders there, keep silent if there is no interpreter, let them keep silent, verse 28. But if there is no one to interpret, let each of them keep silent in church and speak to himself and to God. Do not get up and start speaking if there's not an interpreter. Okay. The next thing he's going to say is that others need to hear and weigh what is said. So this is where edification takes place. When the Word of God has spoken, and people can hear and understand it. We see this in verse 29, let two or three prophets speak and let the others weigh what is said. The point is not just to get up here and talk and fulfill our time say I got 40 minutes in and we can be done. The point is to speak God's Word so that we all can hear it and understand it. Two way the Word of God. I love the imagery that's there. It's not going in one ear and out the other but rather it's taken into the heart, it's considered and the words are weighed their weight to consider their importance. And so we see there the benefit of of hearing and listening, and really how edification takes place. He's gonna go on to say that that women also need to keep silent, just as men are to keep silent if they don't have an interpreter, women are to keep silent from from interrupting with questions. And so that would be a disruption and one that they apparently had a problem with. This is not an absolute prohibition from men speaking when it says to keep silent, or women speaking as they might in songs or in speaking up in Bible class, but here in worship, they are to do all things for edify meaning, if men don't have an interpreter, they're to keep silent. And if women have a question, they're not to interrupt. They're not to voice and cause disruption. But rather they are to keep silent, their questions can be asked at another time. The goal is edification, and building up. And so you should avoid those distractions. Notice what he says in verse 33. When we consider how worship is to be conducted, we understand something about the God that we worship. And that is that God is not a God of confusion. God doesn't promote confusion, he doesn't want us to be confused. He has revealed His Word so that we can understand it, so that we can take it into our hearts and so that we can grow by it. So if that's the God we serve, then we need to display that in how we worship, not in a confusing way, but rather in a way that promotes peace and building up. He also says in verse 40, as he concludes, and wraps up this section, all things should be done decently and in order. Now, the opposite of that appears to be what had been taken place to some degree, disarray, disorder, confusion, speaking over one another. That's not what should happen. But rather, it should be decently in order so that God's word can be heard, and others can wait. And so we see the importance of what he's talking about here. In first Corinthians chapter 14.

Jeremy Sweets  22:28
Well, we we don't have spiritual gifts like they had then. So does this passage help us at all? Is this a passage we can push to the side and say, well, since we don't have spiritual gifts, this doesn't apply to us at all? And I think the answer that is no, we can learn some valuable lessons as we look at at this passage. So what are some? What are some of those lessons? Well, we can build up the body today. And that needs to be our goal, that the church here at Broadmoor would be built up and edify. And we can do that, first of all, by focusing on God's word, focusing on God's word. Leaders. Let me find my place in my notes, yes. He says, Pursue gifts and verse one, especially that you may prophesy. The goal of worship is not to attract attention. You know, worship is not a church is not a business. You know, a business will try to attract others to themselves. And they may do the most outlandish thing possible in order to attract that attention. But the church is not a business in that regard. We're not trying to throw a circus in order to attract attention. We're not trying to do backflips and do all sorts of things so that people will notice us. But rather, the goal of what we're trying to do is preach and proclaim God's word. God's word is our focus. That is how we grow that is how we reach other people. The goal is not to while other people, two people say that's amazing. Now, they might do that with God's word, but not through a circus. That's the best way I know to describe that. And so the goal is straightforward proclamation of the Word of God. We are to avoid any kind of circus that would distract and detract from the Word of God. We want God's word to be clearly understood. And when it is understood, then people can be convicted and edify. The Word of God is our focus. It's not outdated. It's not unimportant. It is how the church today grows. And that should be our focus, regardless of what anyone else would say. Let me also say Yes, that we need to worship with others in view. Paul calls the Corinthians there to recognize Jesus as Lord and to practice love with other people, especially those that you are worshiping with. We need to understand that as we consider others, we need to know that leaders are not really the focus of worship. Leaders are up front, and they lead they help us stay together as we focus on a single topic. But worship is not a performance, where humans are on stage to garner accolades for the best performance. That's not what leaders are doing. Leaders are trying to direct our attention to God in His Word. And so the focus is on God in His word, not on the leaders.

Jeremy Sweets  25:52
When I say that, that doesn't mean we have to make things unappealing monotone and as boring as possible. That is certainly not my point. But the focus is not on the leader. So when we think about others, it's not leaders. That's the focus. It's even true that worshipers are not the focus. And I mean that in terms of what we turn to ourselves, often we go to worship, and we are so used to being in a consumer society, we pick and choose what is simply best for us. And while we may benefit and should benefit from worship, we cannot view worship as some kind of passive activity where we sit, take it in, and then we write it at the end. Well, that was a four star or five star that fit that need there. And I really liked and enjoyed that. That's not what worship in is. But rather, worship is a communal activity, where we come together with our hearts knit together in love, focusing with one mind and one heart upon our great God. That's what we're trying to do in worship. And as we do that, as God is our focus, we are considering one another. We are thinking about one another, how can I help another focus on God? Do you see how that's different than that focus on sell for focus on the leader is a focus on one another to consider how we can encourage one another. And so we see the importance there. Now notice what happens with those two approaches. If I see that I am the focus of worship, I come here only for me to be benefited. That will result in constant complaining and critiquing. You know that song leader, he was off pitch. You know, I really can't tell that because I don't have a great issue. So I won't always know that. You might say the Bible where he he didn't speak up and the preacher boy, he just, he wasn't his best, he wasn't very good. You see if I am the focus than anything that doesn't please me, is to be critiqued and criticized. It's scary to be online and see people make comments about things. But you see people full of this. All they do is critique and criticize Nothing is good enough. If we are the focus, or being the best leader or performer is the focus, then that will result in constant complaining and bickering and backbiting. But what about this other model, where we come together as a communal activity of love encouraging one another? That's going to result not in critiques and criticisms, but in words of encouragement. Now, you, you may critique in order to help out maybe you could do something different here, encouraging a speaker, to think about things, but that's a different approach, isn't it? It's not about sitting back and backbiting. But it's loving one another, reaching out helping one another, encouraging one another. That's what our worship is to be about. And I hope we can see that from this passage. A couple other things as we consider with as we worship with others in view. We need to avoid disruptions. Avoid disruptions. Now, we can't always help disruptions can when there's a lot of babies here, and babies don't act upon command, do they, you know, say Be quiet now and the baby is quiet. You can't help that you can't control that. And so what I am talking about, though, are disruptions we can avoid. And so for those that are younger, it can be a distraction, when there's a constant getting up and going to the bathroom. Make an effort and I know I'm not your parent, but make an effort to do that before why you can avoid a distraction for other people. We can do that by silencing our phones, right? I know sometimes we forget We've all forgotten to do that. But we need to make in efforts to silence that why, so we don't draw attention or anything like that. So we can avoid a distraction. We're here and this is not going to be a perfect environment with all distraction free. It's a big group of people. And so my point is do what you can recognize our focus, and do what you can to avoid distractions, and that can go in many different directions and ways. Another thing we need to consider, as we worship with others, we need to,

Jeremy Sweets  30:35
and this is especially true in singing, we need to sing to other people, we really need to understand that we're here with our fellow brothers and sisters in Christ. And so we need to direct our thoughts into encouraging others. I think that will help us not only Christians, but also non Christians, we need to understand and recognize there may be non Christians that would come in here. And if they were to do that, we need to be able to be speaking in such a way that others can understand. Now others may have questions, I may not understand everything that we do. But we need to make an effort in our delivery of God's word to be understood even by those that are not familiar with maybe all the language or the way that the Bible uses words as Christians would be as they become accustomed to hearing that. And so we need to consider unbelievers and what we're doing. Third, I would suggest that those that do lead and worship need to lead with a purpose. And that purpose is to edify and build up others, just as those that are sitting need to avoid distractions, leaders should avoid distractions as well. There's really no dress code. But you can imagine that there would be some things that are worn that could be distracting. print some prints, maybe wound clothes. Again, I'm not saying that there is a dress code, but I should at least consider and what I'm wearing as I lead a distraction to others, and if it is maybe reconsider what you're wearing. Not only that, but those that are leading should be prepared beforehand as much as possible. I know sometimes things change, you may have to step in. But if you have been assigned ahead of time, something to do, be prepared for that. If you have a scripture reading, read that ahead of time. If you have a prayer, those can be offered extemporaneously, but it may be that you would write out some thoughts and really think beforehand about what you're going to pray about. And so leaders need to lead with a purpose of edifying one another. We need to encourage young people to get up. And as all of us have gotten up, you don't do your best. The first time you do it, it takes practice and it takes work. But do your best for young and for old to speak up. If we have a microphone, speak into the microphone, speak clearly, so that others can understand. And that will take work for all of us as we grow in that area. But that's the goal. So don't run through it and speak as fast as you can to get it over. Don't mumble. When you pray, we often have a habit of lowering our head. But if you're leading in the assembly, have your head up so that others can hear you. And that's something that we often don't do, we bow our head immediately. That's a habit. But if you're leading speak so others can hear you lead with a purpose. There are sure many other things we could say about that many details, give thought to that lead in such a way that others can hear and understand you.

Jeremy Sweets  34:03
We also need to listen to understand and make application. As we hear God's word. This is a communal activity. I am speaking but I hope I'm not the only one here thinking about these words. You have a responsibility here. And your responsibility is to hear and to weigh God's word to make application to your life. You are shortchanging yourself if you ignore the sermon or the song or the prayer you are shortchanging yourself. If you're not paying attention and listening, do your best to listen and to understand. Worship is not entertainment. It is a time when we glorify our God in heaven. And when we grow in our knowledge and appreciation of that glorifying God, when we grow in our knowledge of the truth so We can take those words and apply it to our life. So that when we leave here we can live godly lives that would again give glory to God. You see, worship here is not a matter about a simple hour in time. Its focus is not like entertainment, where you sit and you see and you're amused for a few moments, and then you go about your activities. Now, worship is not something that is short term and its focus. Worship is something that is eternal, and its focus, focusing upon our great God, growing as Christians so that we can give glory to Him applying those things to our lives. It's a continual process of growth and being built up. Worship has eternity in its view. And we need to consider that as we worship. Let me conclude with the fact that we need to glorify God in all things. We need to glorify God in our preaching, being truthful with his word handling accurately speaking forth, what is true preaching the good news of the gospel, we need to glorify God in our preaching. We need to glorify God as we focus upon others and not ourselves in worship, encouraging, building up understanding that we are all to grow together as one body in Christ. We also need to glorify God by listening to his word and obeying it. If you're here this morning, and you're not a Christian, you can glorify God, the Creator of the Universe by obeying the gospel message by believing that Jesus is the Christ by repenting of your sins and turning away from sin and turning to him, confessing that Jesus is the Christ and being baptized into water for the forgiveness of your sins. That brings glory to God. If you're here this morning, and you're Christian and you're not living as you should, sin does not bring glory to God. If you found yourself caught in the Miers of sin, then change that. Make correction. There's anyone that subject to the invitation, please come as we stand and sing at this time.
