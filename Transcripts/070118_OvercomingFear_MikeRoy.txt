It is always such a pleasure to have an opportunity to come and worship our God ppreciate Conrad's lesson this morning as we see a god representative and the father of the prodigal son or sons, who is the father of compassion, we certainly see that in the God whom we serve. So Sunday evening gives us an another opportunity to be fed God's Word, to sing songs of praise his holy name. Thank you, Jesse for those songs that will go along with with the lesson tonight. And so this evening, I want to address a specific issue that is such a common temptation. For all of us since the issue of fear I want to begin with a few popular well known quotations or at least well known people who have addressed the subject of fear. This is Nelson Mandela. He said, I learned that courage was not the absence of fear, but the triumph over it. The brave man is not he who does not feel afraid. But he who conquers that fear, powerful statement. Marcus are really is one of the early Roman emperors in the first century said, This is not death that men should fear. But he should fear never beginning to live, how true. We don't want to live our lives and fear and worry and anxiety. I like this statement from Elena Roseville. If the RS wife, she said, You gained strength, courage and confidence, by every experience in which you really stopped to look fear in the face, you're able to say to yourself, I live through this horror, I can take the next thing that comes along, you must do the thing you think you cannot do? Wow. These people know what what they're talking about when when addressing the issue of fear. We're another quotation, there's probably hundreds of them if you want to search the internet, from Dale Carnegie. He said if you want to conquer fear, don't sit home and think about it. Go out and get busy. And really action is the antidote to worrying feared those types of things. I think, Joan Baez said something to that effect. But the reality is, fear is a common issue. One of the most common things that we struggle with, I know the struggle of fear firsthand myself. The truth is, it's one of the most common struggles that we face as human beings. And it's kind of maybe an ongoing part of life, continually overcoming fear, or maybe it's anxiety or something like that. But the point I want to make here is that we can overcome fear, the same way that Moses did, the same way that David did. The same way Joshua did the same way. Peter did the same way every single Bible character ever overcome fear. It's through faith and courage and love and trust in a persevering spirit. And so let's talk about that this evening. So my lesson is very specific. To the point I want to talk about the issue of overcoming fear. How do we do that? It's not an easy thing to do. But it's something that can be done. And so we're going to take a look at what God's Word says about that. The first thing is, we talked about fear, we can raise the question what is fear and don't have to use a dictionary definition of this, we understand fear and the emotions associated with that, and heart palpitations and all the other stuff and sweating and all types of things. But I like this kind of a definition or acronym from Zig Ziglar from years ago. So what fear is, it's false evidence appearing real. You stop, stop and think about this. So what fear is, generally speaking, first and foremost, fear is really something that's false. It's not to say that when you walk out and the hiking path and you see a bear, that you're not going to feel fear, you will, and there is a natural response to that. But when we deal with the issues of life, that all these quotations referring to, we understand that this is I think, one of the tactics of Satan. He's trying to scare us, to intimidate us, and maybe to paralyze us. First Peter, chapter five and verse eight, Peter said that Satan roams about as a roaring lion seeking someone to devour. He is trying to scare us into silence. I think with fear one of the tactics that he uses, he's trying to frighten us. And so there's a lot of ways we can look at this. This is just one quick approach to that. I liked this quotation I came across years ago. It says that fear knocked at the door. Faith answered. There was no one there.

Mike Roy  04:57
Wow, that's so true. So think Eric comes pounding at the door. And we think life is over, we have a financial crisis, a family crisis with whatever's going on. And again, these are just ways that Satan I think, is trying to, to scare us into silence. So there's really two models of fear. Two ways that we can approach two approaches to fear. Again, I want us to look at this contrast this evening. And the first one is this. When we are wrestling with the issue of fear, we can either forget everything and run, that's F D AR, right? We can forget everything and run. Or we can face everything. And rise is we just sing that song, rise up, oh, man of God rise up, Oh, child of God. So those are two models. And I set those before you as we think about learning to overcome fear. But we can either choose this. So whenever the challenges that we're facing were whatever teaching the Ababa class, dealing with family issues, financial stress, or whatever it may be some situation with your boss, he's going to threaten to fire you because if some false accusation brought against you, so we can either do this, we can forget everything we know and run, tuck tail and run, or we can face everything and rise. I don't know about you, I think I do know that this is what this what we want to do this what I want to do face everything and rise and so use, that's a little tool that we can use to help us combat the the widespread, common temptation that we can face in dealing with fear. So the choice is then to, to rise up in, in the face of difficulty. And so the the point that I make, I've said this for many years, Life is about choices. It's about choices that we make, and it's not what happens to us, but how we respond to doubt and worry and fear. And the question is, how am I going to respond when I'm in a in a fearful situation. And I challenge us to rise up as we sing that song. So let me talk about what we're going to do this evening, how we overcome fear the six points that I want to discuss while you're looking at some scriptures. So we overcome fear by facing our fears, we overcome fear by faith. We overcome fear with a fighting spirit. We overcome fear by prayer, we overcome fear by fearing God more. And we overcome fear by love learning, learning what God's love is, how it how it impacts our life, I should have put another one in there about recognizing God's presence in our lives. But let's these are some important principles that we need to recognize. And so the the point, the first point that I want to talk about when we're looking at scripture in James chapter four in just a moment, is to understand that to overcome fear, here's what it is. I don't care what the fear is, we can we can overcome fears when we face our fears, and we confront them. Somebody wrote a book called facing fear and finding freedom. Well, that title says it all. That's how we find freedom. When we face our fears, the fears can be so paralyzing, it may be fear of our own inadequacies or failures or whatever it may be.

Mike Roy  08:29
But the title of that book is powerful facing fear and finding freedom. So it's really the only way that we overcome our fears. So the first way, perhaps, is to understand that we have to face them. So when we face our fears, they become smaller. Ironically, when we run from fear, our fears become bigger, they chase us. And that's kind of the image I want us to think about. So when we confront fear, and say, I'm not moving on not backing down Satan, he tends to back down. But when we run from fear, boy, Satan, his hate, he's going to chase after us. So we're gonna look at a verse in just a minute, but understand that principle so hard, it's a hard, it's easy to talk about this. But it's more a more difficult challenge, I think, to put that into practice. So really, one of the basic principles of overcoming fear is focused around the idea that we have to confront fear. That's the last thing that we want to do. And I want to share a story with you. Now some of you might remember this because I've been here so long now that you might not remember some of the stories and illustrations from years ago, but this is a great one from probably 45 years ago, young man went to hike from Canada to Mexico. I think he's about 3000 miles by himself. No one has ever done that before. Started out with an 80 pound backpack when it was first full rock not walking the trail of the Rocky Mountains rugged situation. all kinds of interesting stories along the way. But he's he's 20. This is between his senior year of high school and a freshman year in college. So he's going to start college in September. And this is going to take him all summer to make it. It was a daunting task. His name is called is Eric, Eric Ryback has a book out called the high adventure of Eric right back. But he's had all these stories to tell about near death experiences, and it was getting closer to his destination. He's sleeping in a rest, little camping area, and somebody had no doubt had buried some food in the ground, which you're not supposed to do. And the bears can smell that. So he woke up one morning to a 500 pound grizzly bear, staring him in the face. He's in a sleeping bag, no guns, no knives, nothing of that nature that I know of. What do you do in that situation. And so he didn't know what to do, obviously. And so he just tried to inch himself away. And every time he moved a little bit, the berry got closer. And then he'd go and this went on for about 3045 minutes. And because he's thinking, you know, I gotta class start class September 1, and have got to make it to the Mexican border, you got to complete this hike. But this went on for quite a while. And he finally decided he was going to confront the bear and scare the bear. So he slowly unzipped his sleeping bag, and on the count of three, he jumped out and screamed at the top of his lungs.

Mike Roy  11:30
The bear was startled by that didn't expect that. So now they're, they're kind of looking at each other. Again, he's looking at the very end, he yells at the top of his lungs again, screaming blood curdling scream. This time, the bear stands up on his hind legs. And they're looking at each other. He said, well, one more time, and he read back and took a deep breath and screamed at the top of his lungs, in the bear left him. Now that sounds a little bit about what we read in the Scriptures about Satan, that when you resist the devil, I'm not suggesting that you do this necessarily every time. But it illustrates the point. He realized he had to do something. And he confronted the situation. And the the bear actually turned around and left. And it makes me think about this statement and James chapter four. And verse seven says Submit yourselves Deerfoot, therefore, to God, resist the devil could stand up to him, and he will flee from you. So The Surprising Truth About overcoming fear is, we conquer fear when we confront it. But when we run from it, when we hide from it, we we bury our head in the sand and a pillow or whatever, and I don't want to deal with it. Fear doesn't go away. But God tells us to resist the devil when when we when we resist, resist the devil, he will flee from us. But I think we need to realize this truth over here about God's presence in our lives. James says that He yearns jealously over the spirit of it, he is made to dwell in us, but it gives us more grace. So the point I would make is that we don't understand all of what it means for God's spirit to abide in us. But I think practically it means that God is living in me through His Word. And when we act in faith, we're acting as as servants of God. And so again, the look at this passage, just a reminder of a simple truth that when we resist the devil, we're told to resist the devil throughout Scripture, the devil will actually run Ron, is that striking is that shocking in some ways, but James tells us that resist the devil, he will flee from you drawn nearer to God, and He will draw near to you. So that's the first point I want to make about how we overcome fear, get to confront it. And that's again, that's not easy to do. Secondly, I want to suggest that we overcome fear by our faith. In First John chapter five, verse four, John says, for everyone who has been born of God overcomes the world. And this is the victory that has overcome the world. He said, our faith. And so when we think about fear, and worry, and doubt, and anxiety, and all the stuff that can crowd out our minds, it's all part of the world, the mindset of the world. What is the victory that overcomes the world? It's your faith. It's my faith, and I may get strength from you and you may get strength through me. But John says, the victory that overcomes the world is our faith. That means that nobody can stop us from getting to heaven. Nobody can stop us from being faithful to God, or turning back. And so it's a very simple statement that John makes over here, but the reality is we can overcome fear when we exercise our faith. Look at the statement in Ephesians chapter six is a And Paul's telling us to put on the full armor of God. That's one of the ways that we overcome our struggles. Fear is one of them. He said, stand there for having fasten on the, on the belt of truth, having put on the breastplate of righteousness. And as shoes for your feet, having put on the readiness given by the gospel of peace, in all circumstances, take up the shield of faith, with which you can extinguish all the flaming darts of the evil one. So every time Satan throws that flaming fiery dart at you or me, you raise the shield of faith, and you extinguish it. And just remember that you may extinguish it for today, but st is not gonna be very far away from he's gonna look for some way to get you he can't get you today. But But Paul says that we when we raise that shield of faith, we extinguished the flaming darts of Satan. That's powerful. But remember, we were in a war, not just a one day battle. And we need to continue with that, that mindset. So again, the second thing that I want to suggest to us that we overcome fear, by our faith, and maybe that's the most natural thought that comes to your mind. Not to suggest, thirdly, that we overcome fear with a fighting spirit. First Timothy, chapter six and verse 12, in the context, in fact, these letters to Timothy and Titus,

Mike Roy  16:31
that we look at from time to time, talk about the battle for maintaining faithfulness, and exposing error and false teachers, that type of thing. And what as Paul tells Timothy, in verse 12, he said, fight, the good fight of the faith, take hold of the eternal life to which you were called, in about what you made the good confession in the presence of many witnesses. I charged you in the presence of God who gives life to all things in of Christ Jesus, who was in his testimony, testimony before Pontius Pilate made the good confession to keep the commandment unstained and free from reproach and for the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ, standing up for the truth teaching. The truth is, it's a battle. And sometimes we don't like the word fight. We don't like the word battle. But the point I want to make for them, there is a good fight that we have to be engaged in. And if we don't fight for the truth, we might be the victims of error and false teaching. So Paul's telling Timothy, that you fight, the good fight of the faith, you hold on to that. In fact, the Phillips translation says, when it says, Take hold of the eternal life, it says, Keep your grip on that life eternal, like, like you're holding on to that rope, don't let go of that. So we recognize that we, we can overcome fear. And again, this through several of these tools, I think that we we need to have at our disposal, we need to have that fighting spirit. Another way that we overcome fear is by prayer. Paul, again, in finishing out this section on the Christian armor, is says verse 18, praying at all times in the spirit, with all prayer and supplication, and I'm gonna, how much emphasis is placed on prayer, we'll look at a few more verses in just a moment. So he's telling the Christian, the soldier of Christ, praying at all times in the spirit, with all prayer and supplication to the end. To that end, keep alert with all perseverance making supplication for all saints, and also for me, that words may be given to me and in opening my mouth boldly, to proclaim the mystery of the gospel for which I'm an ambassador in change that I made, declare it boldly, as I ought to speak. So when you look at this passage in Ephesians, chapter six, we understand that Prayer is a powerful weapon against worry. And fear and anxiety God begs on us, begs us to cast our anxiety upon Him, to implore Him with prayer and supplication, and look at how many times in just a couple of verses Paul's talking about the importance of prayer, and what's the result of that? Through prayer, he said, I can speak the gospel boldly, and not be afraid of the enemy, not be afraid of the false teachers. So knowing that they were praying for him, and he was certainly praying for himself, gave him that sense of confidence. Look at the statement, I think that David make in the Psalms, and Psalm chapter 34, and verses four and five. He said, I sought the Lord and he answered me, I sought the Lord, that's I think the prayer, and he answered me and delivered me from all my fears. So prayer is one of those weapons that we have at our disposal if we'll use that fervent prayer, to overcome our weaknesses. I'll make the statement in verse five, when he said those who look to him are radiant in their faces shall never be ashamed. I think the reality is when we fix our gaze on God, and on Jesus Christ to see His power, His holiness, His grace, His mercy and love. He empowers us to overcome the struggles that we may may be facing. And so again, we recognize that one of the tools at our disposal to overcome fear is prayer. And let's use that couple of the points that I want to mention this evening. So one way that we overcome fear, whether it's fear of others, or fear of failure, or whatever fear of what people might think about us, or whatever the fear might be, we can overcome that when we learn to fear God, more than we fear what other people might say or think about us. So in verse 26, he says, So in the context of persecution, Jesus is admonishing and encouraging his disciples that they preach the gospel not to give in to fear and given to intimidation, that type of thing, and turn in relation to those who are persecuting them. He said, have no fear of them. Don't be afraid of those people who are insulting you, who ridicule you, he said, For nothing is covered that will not be revealed or hidden, that will not be known. But I tell you in the dark, say in the light, and what you hear, whispered proclaim on the house tops. And he said in verse 28, here's one of the keys brevan Right here. And do not fear those who kill the body, but cannot kill the soul.

Mike Roy  21:26
One way that we overcome fear of people, fear of failure, fear persecution, is saying they can't kill my soul, they might kill my body. They can't kill my soul. But what Jesus does say, left part of verse 28, he says, rather fear him who just can't destroy both soul and body in hell. Why were the apostles so bold? Why were the early Christians so courageous, even Timothy going to prison for the gospel? Why? Because they learned to fear God more than they feared people. And we're so afraid to be politically, I'm correct. If we're afraid that we're going to offend somebody if we if we tell the truth on various issues. But if we fear God, more than we fear people, then we're going to overcome all these common fears and worries that can swirl in our minds. Look at another passage in the Old Testament. Proverbs chapter 14, verses 26 and 27. This one of my favorites, Proverbs, it says, In the fear of the Lord, or by fearing the Lord, one has strong confidence, who needs more confidence? I do we all do. How do we get more confidence says by fearing God in the fear of the Lord, one has strong confidence and his children will have a refuge if you want to save our children. And we do. One of the ways that we do that is by fearing God, letting them see that we reverence God and fear Him above every person on earth. When they see that, guess what they get? Confidence, assurance, they've got a refuge, my daddy knows the way to heaven, my mom is going to be faithful till she dies. When the children see that, I'm going to heaven too. And they're not going to go down the wrong road of social drinking and, and wealth and all the stuff that the world is throwing at us. So in verse 27, the writer says, the fear of the Lord is a fountain of life, that one may turn away from the snares of death. So again, The Surprising Truth is that we overcome fear when we have a greater fear of God than we do. Of those around us. One other point that I want us to look at this evening and I'm going to be looking at a scripture is well is this is really not just one way that we overcome fear. But I think there's several components to that. But I'm gonna suggest to you that we we conquer fear, we can conquer fear by ultimately by love. So the get all these elements here, that we've been talking about this evening. But look at this statement over here, that John makes the apostle John. In First John chapter four in verse 18, he said, There is no fear in love, but perfect love casts out fear, for fear has to do with punishment, and whoever fears has not been perfected love so the first point I want to make about love and the power of love is really realized what he's saying, there there is, there's no fear in love. He's talking about I didn't look at the word and maybe the word from which we get phobia, but there's no fear. There's no fear in love. That's that's a blanket statement.

Mike Roy  24:50
That then he goes on to say that perfect love casts out fear. Perfect love can Estelle fear for fear has to do with punishment, and whoever fears has not been perfecting love. So if I'm struggling with fear in some capacity, whether it's fear of people, fear of failure, fear of what other people might think about me, I don't love enough, I don't love God enough. And if I love people, I'm not gonna be afraid of them. So this is a powerful truth. And it's an emphatic statement, John said, there is no fear, in love. And so the challenge then in overcoming fear, is to practice love at a deeper level. Now look at a couple of verses, Zephaniah chapter three in verses 16 and 17. So Zephaniah is trying to encourage fallen Judah, they're in captivity. He's trying to encourage them to persevere through that so that they can, can come through the other side and be restored to their land and ultimately is fulfilled, I think, the Lord's people. But he says in verse 16, on that day, it shall be said to Jerusalem, fear not, oh, Zion, Let not your hands grow weak, the Lord your God is in your midst, a mighty one who will save you. He will rejoice over you with gladness, and it says he will quiet you. By his love. He will exalt over you with loud singing, so a lot of truths in there. He said, The Lord God is in your midst, he's among you. So we shouldn't be afraid. Even if they're in captivity. God's saying, I'm going to be with you. I'm going to restore you have a powerful god, I'm mighty does say we sing those songs. And then he uses that phrase, of God and think about these people. They were idol worshipers. They were idol worship are guilty of sin thrown into captivity, Babylonian captivity for the nation of Judah. And, and so here they are horrible sin. And God encouraged them to turn from sin. And then Zephaniah says if he's going to quiet you by His love, so the the reality is one of the most powerful ways that we can be calm with our fears and anxious thinking, and that type of thing is with God's love. And again, this first shows us what I'm saying is the tranquilizing nature of God's love. And the prophet is telling them that God because of his love, his concern for them, he's going to give them that assurance, he's going to quiet them by his love. And I want to suggest to each one of us, that God's love is a more powerful anti anxiety medicine than anything you can ever take. As powerful and we need to recognize that. And so sometimes we we don't recognize that or maybe even believe the power of God's love. Let's let's look at one of the passage this evening. I want to read from Psalms 103. And several verses over here.

Mike Roy  27:52
No, and then I'll put a couple of these on on the screen for emphasis sake. But again, this is going to focus on God's character, His Holiness, but ultimately his love for his people. And look at Psalm chapter 103 And verse one. The psalmist says, Blessed the Lord, oh my soul and all that is within me, bless His holy name. Bless the Lord, oh, my soul and forget none of his benefits who pardons all your iniquities, Who heals all your diseases, Who redeems your life from the pit who crowns you visualize this who crowns you with loving kindness and compassion, Who satisfies your years with good things so that your youth is renewed like the eagle, the Lord performance, righteous deeds and judgments for all who are oppressed, he made known his ways to Moses, he acts to the sons of Israel, the Lord is compassionate and gracious. We saw that illustrated and the father of Luke chapter 15. And Conrad's lesson this morning at God's heart is compassion and mercy and love. It's true of the father in the parable issue of God the Lord is compassionate and gracious, slow to anger, and abounding and loving kindness. He will not always strive with us or chide us I think the ESP says, nor will He keep His anger forever. He has not dealt with us according to our sins nor rewarded us according to our iniquities. For as high as the heavens are above the earth. So great is His love or steadfast love loving kindness to the toward those who feared him as far as the east is from the west. So far, he has removed our transgressions from us, just as a father has compassion on his children. So the Lord has compassion on those who fear Him, for he himself knows our frame, he is mindful that we are but dust. As for man, his days are like grass as a flower of the fields so he flourishes, when the wind pass has passed over it, it is no more in his place, and its place acknowledges it no longer but the loving kindness of the Lord is from everlasting to everlasting on those who fear Him in His righteousness to children's children, to those who keep his covenant To remember his precepts to do them. So let me just focus on these couple of verses before we wrap up the lesson this evening. I want you to think about this with me for just a moment. So verse 10, says about God concerning us, he does not treat us as our sins deserve or repay us according to our iniquities. Verse 11, he said, For as high as the heavens are above the earth, so great is His love for those who fear him. Do you fear God? I do. I trust that you do as well. Now think about this for just a moment. I know we've got some school teachers here, and mathematicians and engineers, and a lot of really smart people. How high above the earth of the heavens can't be measured, is immeasurable. Think about that, how high are the heavens, you cannot measure it. That's how much God loves you. That's amazing. That's amazing love. And that will calm your anxious fears and doubts and worries that we all can can wrestle with. And so it's a reminder. And the book of Psalms is telling us that God's love is so great, it's as high as the heavens are above the Earth. It's immeasurable. So this is showing us how really how high and deep and wide and long God's love this for us. Look at this other verse in verses 17 and 18, the ESV puts it this way. But the steadfast love of the Lord is from everlasting, to everlasting on those who fear Him in His righteousness to children's children, to those who keep his covenant and remember to do his cut to His commandments. So we're talking about one of the ways one of the ways that we overcome fear and you can throw in worry, inadequacy, or anxiety, whatever it might be doubt. Now think about this again. When you look at this, this statement over here, the steadfast love the Lord, He's talking about God's love for His people is from everlasting, to everlasting. So my first question is, When did God's love for you begin? When did God's love for you begin? It didn't ever begin. Find the standards passage, it was always there from everlasting, before the foundation of the world.

Mike Roy  32:43
God has been loving those who fear him That's you, right? And when it how long Is God gonna love you for 100,000 years, for 10 million years. God's love doesn't end, from everlasting to everlasting. The steadfast love of God never ceases. You need something to calm your anxious thoughts, fears and worries, God's love will calm it better than anything else. So there's a lot of things that we can do to overcome fear, but understanding this truth, we go through life I'm, you know, thinking, I obey the gospel and, and I'm always trying to do what's right. And sometimes I stumble and fail and come short. And then I think, Oh, God must be so angry at me. And then I try to do good again and repent of my sins and press forward. And, and again, there's so much that is based on my performance, and certainly God wants me to repent. He wants all of us to do that. But what this passage tells us that God's steadfast love is from everlasting to ever lasting, on those who fear Him, not who was sinless, the perfect those who keep his covenant, those who remember to do His commandments, none of us do that perfectly. But when we commit to keeping that covenant and being faithful to God, His love is endless and amazing, a truth. This is one of the truths in life that we have to learn. I've been preaching, just thinking about this. So I've been a Christian this this year 40 years have been a obey the gospel of Sunnyvale, California, been preached for 13 years and Alabama, full time been preaching on a film basis here for almost 20 years, 19 years, and with Norman Curtis been serving as one of the elders for almost 10 years. I'm still learning the magnitude and the depth of God's love. It just takes your breath away

Mike Roy  34:59
so We have to understand that brethren, that the antidote to fear surprisingly, is not always faith, but it's love. You can rest in God's love and grace, it's endless. All I've got to do is seek His kingdom first, do my best. And trust that grace. And so this passage in last couple of days when I was preparing this lesson really struck me got my attention. So as we think about how we overcome fear, yes, we overcome fear. When we face our fear, we do so by faith, we do so with a fighting spirit. We do by prayer, we do by fearing God more. And we overcome fear, ultimately, I believe, by God's love, and I think that's by his design, that we trust Him, and we seek to obey his will. If there's any here this evening who have not become a Christian, again, God's not looking for sinless perfection, but he does want us to obey his will which involves faith in Jesus Christ and will lead us to repent of our sins, confessing that faith before men and a willingness to be baptized in water, because that's what God has commanded. It may be that you need the praise of this congregation, we all have struggles. We all have difficulties that we face and we we are here to help and assist any who might have that need might come while we stand and sing this invitation song
