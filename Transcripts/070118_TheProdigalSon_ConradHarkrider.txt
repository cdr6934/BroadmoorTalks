Do you have your Bibles or want to be turning to the Gospel of Luke?

Conrad Harkrider  00:22
It's common for the apostle Paul in his writings to refer to God as our Father, particularly at the beginning of his letters. When he's writing to the Ephesians. He says, grace and peace from God, our Father, and the Lord Jesus Christ. It's not just Paul who uses this address. When Jesus was teaching the disciples how to pray. He said, Pray in this way, our Father who is in heaven, not my father, hallowed be your name. The Lord is not just a creator, and a maker, and a Lord, He is our Father, there is a special relationship that is implied there. This morning, we're going to look at one of the most well known parables in all of Scripture. And I believe what we see here is a picture of the Father. We see a portrait we see into his heart, we see His grace and His love. Turn to Luke chapter 15. And read with me about the parable of the prodigal. Luke chapter 15, in verse 11. Then he said, A certain man had two sons. And the younger of them said to his father, Father, give me the portion of goods that falls to me. So he divided to them his livelihood. And not many days after the younger son gathered all together, and journey to a far country, and there wasted his possessions with prodigal living. But when he had spent all there arose a severe famine in that land and he began to be in want. Then he went and joined himself to a citizen of that country. And he sent him into his fields to feed swine. And he would have gladly filled his stomach with the pods that the swine ate. But no one gave him anything. But when he came to himself, he said, How many of my father's hired servants have bread enough, and to spare, and I perish with hunger, I will arise and go to my father and will say to him, Father, I have sinned against heaven and before you, and I am no longer worthy to be called your son, make me like one of your hired servants. And he arose and came to his father. But when he was still a great way off, his father saw him and had compassion, and ran and fell on his neck and kissed him. And the son said to the Father, I have sinned against heaven and in your sight, and I'm no longer worthy to be called your son. But the father said to his servants, quickly bring the best rope, put it on him, put a ring on his hand and sandals on his feet, Bring the fattened calf here and kill it and let us eat and be merry, for this son of mine was dead and is alive again. He was lost and is found. And they began to be merry. Now there was an older son who was in the field. And as he came and drew nearer to the house, he heard music and dancing. So he called one of the servants and asked what these things meant. And he said to him, your brother has come and because he has received him safe and sound, your father has killed the fatted calf. But he was angry, and would not go in. Therefore his father came out and plead with pleaded with him. So he answered and said to his father, lo, these many years I have been serving you, I never transgressed your commandment at any time. And yet you never gave me a young goat that I might make marry with my friends. But as soon as this son of yours, who came and devoured your livelihood with harlots, you kill the fatted calf for him. And he said to him, Son, you are always with me. And all that I have is yours. It was right that we should make marry and be glad for your brother was dead and is alive again and was lost and is found.

Conrad Harkrider  04:57
This parable is actually a portion of a three part mini series that Jesus presents on things that are lost. Beginning in Luke chapter 15. He tells about the lost sheep, the lost coin. And now here the lost son. The setting for the teaching is described in verses one and two of chapter 15. The scribes and the Pharisees were grumbling and complaining, how can this man receive and welcome those who are sinners? Jesus offers this teaching in response to their criticisms. There are three main characters in the parable, I'd like to look at each one and notice some of the characteristics that they display. First of all, consider the prodigal in verse 12, he comes to his father not with a question but with a demand give me my inheritance. He is an restrained, this type of request would have been disgraceful. And inheritance is something that is promised while someone is living, but is only granted or given upon their death. And so in essence, this younger son is saying, Father, I wish you were already dead. He packs up all of his stuff and heads to a far country, away from his father, away from his family, away from any worries and stresses and responsibility for the first time in his life. He doesn't have to answer to anyone. He can do what he wants. He can be around who he wants, he can buy what he wants, there are no rules, he is completely on restrained. This country boy has come to the big city and he is now he's ready to spend no rules. In our time, it's a place with neon lights, fast cars, open bars, gambling drinks, and plenty of players pleasures, where the party never stops. He's not concerned with the future. He's not thinking about what lies ahead. He's just having a good time. A few years ago, Budweiser came out with a slogan for one of their beers for Bud Light. It said the perfect beer for for removing no from your vocabulary for the night. Hashtag up for whatever. Just take no out of your vocabulary. And isn't that what the world is selling? Let loose. Have a good time. Enjoy yourself. So many people, especially those who are young have been enticed to go off to the far country to be living a life that is not constrained by anything. Yes, there are fun times to be had in the far country. Until the bottle runs dry and the music stops and the party ends and we find this party boy is now empty. He's left with nothing because after spending everything that he had money that was supposed to last for decades has now been used up in a short period of time. And to make matters worse, there is this famine. The economy has turned south there is no food. There are no jobs. And the only thing that he can find for himself to do is to be a caretaker for the pigs. The boy who sought freedom and fun is now the servant of a pig farmer. For the Jew, this would have been utterly humiliating pigs were an unclean animal. This would have like been going to get a job at the county fair, cleaning the toilets. It was dirty. It was smelling smelly and it was embarrassing. And not only that, but he is so hungry. That he is longing for he is desiring to eat the pods that are being given to the pigs. Whenever we change the

Conrad Harkrider  09:52
car seats out of the car, there's always little pieces of food that dropped down on the browned. Cheerios, raisins, grapes that now look like raisins. And so one day I went back into the house and came back out and the toddler was squatted down on the ground picking up the pieces and popping them into her mouth. The younger brother is empty. He has nothing. He's hit rock bottom, no one cares. No one is concerned. And now he finds himself desiring the scraps from the pig trough. Where all the friends were all the people that surrounded him that he enjoyed being with when he first came here. He is empty. What Jesus is doing in this parable is giving us a picture of the reality of sin. Have you ever done this? You go to the store, you buy a big piece of fruit, you bring it home, it looks great. It looks juicy and tasty. You cut into it, only to find that it is mushy, and grainy and rotten. And that's what sin does. Sin over promises and under delivers on the surface. It seems wonderful, there is fun, there is excitement. But underneath there is no substance. It just leaves us wanting more. It cannot satisfy and it will not fill us up as the writer of Ecclesiastes said it is like grasping or chasing after the wind. This boy thought he was gaining freedom, but really what he was doing was just becoming a slave to sin. And isn't that what happens to us when we take our spiritual inheritance and the blessings that God has given to us and we waste it on selfish desires. The parable could have ended right here. rich kid, takes great opportunity, squanders it and makes a wreck of his life. And those are the types of stories that the news outlets, the media, they love to write

Unknown Speaker  12:22
about that.

Conrad Harkrider  12:25
The great fall. But we see that he was repentant. Verse 17 says that he came to himself. I don't know how long it took. But at some point while he was helping those pigs get their breakfast, lunch and dinner he realized, what am I doing here? What have I been thinking? He remembers his father of all the people that have lied to him that have cheated him that have turned their backs on him. He thinks about his father, his father is a good man. His father is a man who provides for His servants. He gives them bread and enough bread they have leftover. And so he comes up with an idea he is going to go back to his father and say, I have sinned. I have messed up. I've committed wrong against heaven and against you. Make me as one of your hired servants. Notice this young man has no demands. He doesn't go back and say I want to be restored to be your son. I want things to be just as they were. I don't want anybody to find out about what's happened. He doesn't offer any excuses. He doesn't say well, I just got caught up in this and you know, really you shouldn't let me go and the way that I've been raised all of these things have contributed to this. He accepts responsibility for what he's done. He humbles himself. Before the father of verse 19, I am no longer worthy to be called your son. If you remember when Samuel came to Saul, after they had attacked the AMA Guides, God had told them to utterly destroy his enemies. And after coming and seeing the people return with all of the flocks, Samuel says Why have you disobeyed and Paul or Saul rather he he points to the people he says it was the people who brought them back. And that is our tendency. We see it from the beginning of time in the garden when Adam and Eve are confronted with their sin. They point the finger. It was the serpent. It was the woman It was you God But this young man takes the blame. I have sinned he is repentant.

Unknown Speaker  15:18
The Father,

Conrad Harkrider  15:20
the Father in this parable is truly remarkable. We see that he was pained. What was it like the day that his son like? Was there some type of disagreement? An argument that happened? Did he have the opportunity to tell him goodbye. Knowing the type of world that his son was about to travel and venture off into it must have caused him great pain and heartache. Even though he's still living in verse 32, he refers to him as dead as lost. It was as if there was a death in the family. They couldn't speak to him, they couldn't talk to him. And I just imagine every night as they sat down to eat dinner, the father looked across the table at that empty chair, and wondered where his son was. Each night going to bed thinking about if he was okay, waking up in the morning, hoping that that would

Unknown Speaker  16:30
be the day that he would return.

Conrad Harkrider  16:35
I was talking to an older couple. And I asked them if they had any children. And they said they had three boys and a daughter. And they paused and then they said, but she's passed away. And I asked them how long it had been. And they said nearly 20 years. And as they started to talk about her, their voices cracked because the pain was still there. Losing a child is not something that just goes away or you eventually forget about this father is hurting. One of his own is lost. But notice that although he is troubled and distressed, he allows his son to face the consequences to go through pain. He doesn't send a cohort to bring him back. He doesn't deposit money into his account when he spends it all. But all the while he is waiting and looking and anticipating and hoping for the return of his son. He is compassionate. The climax of the story the text tells us that while the sun was still a very long way off, the father could see him in the distance. He recognizes his son maybe the way he was walking or his stature his build. He knows it's him. And verse 20 says that he felt compassion for him. Compassion, it was more than just a Fil A feeling. Because we see him literally get up and run towards his son. Running was not something that dignified older men did in this culture. The only time you found a man running is if he was being chased by a wild animal. But here he picks up his robes. He throws aside any type of pride and he runs towards his son. We don't see any of the natural responses resentment or anger if one of our kids took the car without asking. And they wrecked it. And we saw them walking back up the street we might run towards them so that we could wring their neck. What were you thinking? I told you this would happen? How could you be so foolish? When the father gets to the sun, he embraces him. It says that he falls on his neck and he begins to kiss him. The dirty, slop covered, smelly prodigal has returned with no money, no shoes and no reason to be respected or welcomed and yet the Father shows compassion This is a father who is gracious as the Sun begins his little speech Maybe it was something that he had practiced on the long journey home, rehearsing it in his head thinking about okay what I want to say to my father. And as he gets into it, I have sinned against heaven and in your side and I'm no longer worthy to be called your son. It's almost as if the father cuts him off. Halfway through, he stops it right there and starts giving orders. Quickly bring out the best row put a ring on his hand sandals on his feet. This is the type of dress that is reserved for princes, and for sons, not for a servant or a slave. He ordered that the fattened calf should be slaughtered, and a great feast, prepare the fattened calf, the one that had been growing and being reserved or saved for a very special occasion. Where is the lecture? What about probation? If this were us, we'd want to make sure that they had actually changed their lives. We don't want to see them work for a little while to know that their heart had actually been changed. But this father, he is gracious and kind, his forgiveness is total and complete. He doesn't look down or belittle his son. Instead, there is tremendous joy and celebration. Because verse 24, this son who was dead is alive, he was lost, and is found and the father receives him back with no strings attached.

Unknown Speaker  21:38
This is the picture of God.

Conrad Harkrider  21:43
God our Father is grieved when we turn away from Him. As much as our sin can affect us, as much as it can affect those around us. Our Father in heaven, the creator of the universe, is hurt. He is torn by our sin. Luke chapter 19 tells us about Jesus, and how before he came into Jerusalem, he wept over the city. He saw how they had rejected the prophets, how they had dismissed the Messiah. And it brought him to tears, knowing the tremendous opportunity they had ignored, and also the devastation and the judgment that was coming. And he was greatly pained if we could see how God feels if we could put ourselves in God's position

Conrad Harkrider  22:50
we would have no problem sharing the gospel with others. He is compassionate, he is merciful. He is a God who runs towards the center.

Conrad Harkrider  23:08
And finally, the older brother. We typically refer to this as the parable of the prodigal. But I think I believe that the point that Jesus is trying to drive home really relates to this older brother. He is giving this parable in the context of those who are challenging him who were protesting his action and his his actions and behavior of spending time with people who were sinful. And what we see in this older brother is that he was annoyed. He comes back to the house after a long day of work, and he hears all this commotion. There's dancing and singing and he gets one of the servants and he asks him what's going on? I wasn't aware of any type of planned celebration. And the servant says, Your brother has returned and your father has slaughtered the fattened calf. And I want you to imagine the look on his face. It is one of silent rage. The lousy, irresponsible, arrogant, younger brother has returned. Somehow he managed to not get himself killed when he was off in the far country. He's made it back and now we are throwing a party for him. That doesn't make any sense. Think about your younger brother comes home. And dad gets the family together and he says I want to take everyone out for a steak dinner tonight. Because your younger brother has Just flunked out of college and he's come to live back at the house. This is ridiculous. fatten caps are for weddings there for the birth of a child there for dining with a special guest. When Abraham received the messengers, he told Sarah to go and slaughter the choice calf. Those messengers turned out to be angels. You don't kill the fatted calf for the low life kid who has taken the family's money and blown it on prostitutes. He is annoyed and angry, and I think we can see his point. This is not right. It's not reasonable, and it's not

Unknown Speaker  25:50
fair. But we see that he is self righteous.

Conrad Harkrider  26:03
He refuses to go into the party. And the father comes out in pleads with him to come in to join them. And he objects. He says, I have been with you this entire time, and have never disobeyed you. I have never received a young goat so that I could go and celebrate with my friends. He's saying I'm the perfect Son. never done anything wrong. Although I questioned the accuracy of that statement, never received enough praise and recognition. Although again, I'm sure that's not true. He's been living with the Father this whole time. But that wasn't enough for him. Those who are self righteous, overlook their own mistakes and failures. They like to focus on the really bad sins of other people, the people who are making a mess of their lives. Sure, they may be gossiping and lusting and coveting, but all of those things can be done inside the father's house. In other words, you don't have to leave to a far country to partake in that. When the tax collector and the Pharisee went up to the temple to pray, the Pharisee he thanked God that he wasn't like these sinners, that he wasn't a robber or an adulterer or even a tax collector. Why hasn't anyone thrown a party to honor this older brother for being such a good son? Do you see the problem here? This good boy is the only one who's not at the Father's house. He's not a part of the celebration. He is soaking over his grievances. Instead of rejoicing with the Father, he is self righteous. think the point that Jesus is trying to open up their eyes to is that he is lost. The parable ends with the father coming out to implore Him to come back in to the house. But Jesus doesn't tell us whether or not he accepts that invitation. We're kind of left hanging here that the parable ends. We don't know the end of the story. And I think what Jesus is trying to show is that the question for the Pharisees and the scribes, it's still outstanding, they have a choice to make. Are they going to come in and receive the sinner who has returned and rejoice with their father. These two brothers are polar opposites. On the one hand, you have one that stays the other, goes off and disregards his father. One serves him diligently. The other commits every sin in the book. But there's one thing that they both shared. They're both outside of the Father's house. They are both lost, and we see the father going out to receive or reach out to both of them. Why was this older brother lost. He followed the commands. He had been serving faithfully diligently for all of these years. But he didn't share the Father's heart. We can come to church, we can live a moral life. We can do everything that's been asked of us but if we don't share the father's compassion and concern For those who are lost, we can't be His children. First Timothy chapter two and verse four says that God desires all people to come to a knowledge of the truth and be saved. That's his desire do we share it with him? There's a third son in the story.

Conrad Harkrider  30:30
We see that the prodigal is a sinner. Everyone can see that. The older brother is self righteous. He thinks about how good he is. But there is a son who is telling this parable Jesus, the perfect Son of God. You see, Jesus has never broken the Father's heart with his sin. But at the same time, even though he is sinless, Jesus shares his father's heart the compassion and the love for the loss. He was willing to give up his life so that those who are in sin could be saved. How deep the Father's love for us? How vast beyond all measure that he would give his only son to make a rich, his treasure, treasure. Are you outside of the Father's house? Have you journeyed to the far country and come to realize that all of the sin and the glamour and the pleasure is short lived? Or do you see see yourself standing outside of the Father's house looking at the celebration that's happening? regretful and bitter and jealous. The father implores his children, to come home, submit themselves to his will repent of their sins. And if you haven't put on the Lord Jesus Christ and baptism, we encourage you to do that. To wash away your sins and to begin a new life in Christ. We extend God the Father's invitation as we stand in seeing
