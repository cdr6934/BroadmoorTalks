Matt Bassford  00:00
Good evening, everyone, it is good to be here together with all of you, I greatly appreciate the invitation from the elders to be here. And I've also enjoyed the opportunity to worship with you as you sing praise to God so enthusiastically. Also, it's a sight that gladdens my heart, as I look out across this auditorium and see so many families that have young children, I know that it is no small thing for you to be here this evening. My own kids are now nine and seven. But I still remember that time very well. And I remember what an ordeal it can be, especially if your kids have a 730 Bedtime to show up for that seven o'clock service on Wednesday evening. So I appreciate your being here. And I trust that what I have to say, will make your effort and your sacrifice worthwhile. When we consider the broader American society around us, it is obvious that there are some passages that have made the leap from text that only devout students of the Bible will know to being passages that just about everybody is aware of and familiar with. And in this latter category of passages that are household catchphrases, I think we can put the punch line of Philippians chapter four beginning with verse 11. Turn with me there in your Bibles. Let's read this together Philippians 411 through 13. The apostle Paul writing sets not that I am speaking of being in need, for I have learned in whatever situation I am to be content. I know how to be brought low and I know how to about in any and every circumstance, I have learned the secret of facing plenty and hunger, abundance and need, I can do all things through Him who strengthens me. We live in a nation that idolizes success, and I don't think that's too strong a term to apply to it. And so it is not surprising when a passage like this, that appears to promise success in everything through Jesus. It's not surprising when a passage like this attract such attention. Philippians 413 is the kind of text that we see the local Fellowship of Christian Athletes putting on the t shirt. Back when Lauren and I were going through childbirth class, our childbirth instructor happened to be religious. And so she advised the women when they were in labor, that one of the things they could say to get themselves through it was Philippians 413. Now, I suppose that all of that is very inspiring. But is that really what the Apostle wants us to understand? Is he really telling us that Jesus is the key to unlocking earthly success? Whereas this passage about something quite different? Let's consider this topic. Let's explore it, as we look to see what the Scriptures have to say to us about doing all things through Christ. I think that in order to appreciate whether we can apply this passage to our situation, if that's what we want to do, the first thing that we must do is to evaluate our goal. And Paul gives us a useful yardstick for doing this in Colossians, chapter three, beginning with first one, so flip over there with me to Colossians three, one and two.

Matt Bassford  04:08
If then, you have been raised with Christ, seek the things that are above where Christ is seated at the right hand of God. Set your mind on things that are above, not on things that are on earth, for you have died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God. One of the fascinating things about this text to me is that in it Paul is making an opposition setting up an opposition. That is not what we normally see in Scripture. He's not telling us to set our thing our minds on righteous things instead of sinful things. Instead, the text says that we are to set our minds on the things above but not on the things that are on the earth. And it's very different. Because a goal cannot be sinful, and yet still be earthly. There are all sorts of things that we have the right to pursue on Earth, that still don't have any religious significance. And so what Paul is telling us that, that it is fine for us to have these earthly goals, but they shouldn't be where our minds are set. Instead, we should have our minds focused on those spiritual heavenly goals, if we are to be true disciples of Jesus. Here, I think is where we run into the first problem with the way that Philippians 413 is normally applied. Now, there's nothing wrong with wanting to score touchdowns, there's nothing wrong with wanting to have a successful labor. But when we look at those things, we see that they really aren't God's goals. Those things are our goals. Those are things that we want to do in this life for our own reasons. And it's not really the direction that Philippians 413 is pointed. Instead, if we're talking about doing all things through Jesus, what we're talking about, is doing what Jesus wants us to do with the power that he provides. He is the one who is setting those goals and not we ourselves. And if we consider briefly the context of Philippians 413, it's obvious how this is working out in practice. Paul, there is not so much concerned with achieving as he is with enduring contextually what he is talking about, is how Christ has strengthened him. So that even in times of extreme poverty, poverty, that none of us have known poverty, where he doesn't even have enough to eat. Christ has strengthened him so that he is still able to preach the gospel. And that is precisely what he is talking about when he says I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me. Most people in America would not consider that a success story. They would not view continuing to serve God through suffering and hardship, as the sort of thing toward which they want to aim their lives. And yet to Paul, this was obviously something that was extremely important and meaningful. So too, it ought to be for us. Once again, it is fine for us to have earthly goals. But those earthly goals shouldn't be the focus of who we are. Rather than being concerned with earthly triumphs. Our priorities ought to be the triumphs of the spirit. Maybe things that nobody else would even notice, are the things that ought to be the most important to us. For instance, we ought to be considering questions like, how am I doing in my battle against secret sin? Am I more compassionate and merciful today than I was a year ago? Am I walking in the footsteps of Jesus and Paul, as I patiently endure suffering for the sake of Christ. Those are not the kinds of things that are going to show up on anybody's resume. But they may well be the things that are recorded in the Book of Life, and we ought to view them accordingly.

Matt Bassford  08:56
Secondly, as part of this struggle to do all things through Jesus, we ought to remember to pray for boldness. And here Let's look together at the story found at the tail end of Acts, chapter four, Acts chapter four, verses 29 through 31.

Matt Bassford  09:23
The apostles are praying and they say, And now Lord, look upon their threats, and grant to your servants to continue to speak your word with all boldness, while you stretch out your hand to heal, and signs and wonders are performed through the name of your holy servant Jesus. And when they had prayed, the place in which they were gathered together, was shaken, and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and continued to speak the word of God with all boldness. Can contextually, this is impressive. what has just happened in x three is that the apostles Peter and John have healed the lame man. And for this good deed, they have found themselves hauled before the authorities they've been dragged into court for working this miracle and then proclaiming Jesus. While in court, they have been warned that if they continue to proclaim Jesus, then they will surely suffer for it at the authorities heads. So they've been told all of these ominous things. And yet when they get back together with their friends, what they do is they pray for boldness. Here, too, I think we encounter a critique of the usual pop culture reading of Philippians 413. Typically, when people sort of out in the world are talking about doing all things through Christ, they are talking about how God has given them the ability to do something. For instance, God has given them the ability to be successful athletically, God has given them the ability to have a successful career. And once again, there is nothing wrong with that. But that's not the kind of spiritual struggle that we see going on and acts for me because an X for the apostles have the physical capacity and the mental capacity to go on preaching Christ, they're capable of doing that their ability is not the issue. What the issue is, is their commitment, whether despite their fear, they are going to continue to do what is right. And I would suggest to you this evening, that in our walk with God, it is often fear that is one of our biggest spiritual problems. This is obvious, I think, when it comes to service, I think every one of us has known that struggle when it comes to evangelism, that we know that we should tell somebody about Jesus but we're afraid to the same thing, though, is also true of our struggles with sin. This is less obvious, but I think fear is just as significant there. Because very often when we having this ongoing struggle with some recurring sin, whether it's porn or alcohol or gossip, what have you all the things that Christians struggle with? Usually there is fear that is underlying it. We have this we have this sin. Yeah, there we go. We are having this struggle against sin, where we physically could quit the sin, we could walk away from that evil habit right now. But the problem is, that we are afraid to the problem is that we are comfortable in our sin and we are afraid that life will become an unpleasant if we leave it behind. So then in both of these situations, whether we are talking about wanting to be bold in our service, or whether we are talking about wanting to be bold in renouncing sin, our solution needs to be prayers for boldness. Very often, the biggest problems that we face are not problems that can be solved by bigger brains or bigger quadriceps. Instead, what we need are hearts that are bigger and stronger.

Matt Bassford  14:04
And if that's truly what we want, then obviously these prayers for boldness need to be constant. We can't just ask God for boldness once and then go our way and expect that to be enough. Instead, as we recognize our weakness, as we recognize our inability in and of ourselves to do what we know we must, that is when we need to turn to Jesus and seek the strength that we can find in him. Once we have done this, though, we need simply to be strong and act. And that will be our final study for this evening. Look with me at the text of Ezra chapter 10 beginning with verse two where we see a man of God facing a similar Call to Action

Matt Bassford  15:00
As your chapter 10, verses two through four, and check Anya, the son of the heel of the sons of Elam, addressed Ezra, we have broken faith with our God, and have married foreign women from the peoples of the land. But even now there is hope for Israel in spite of this. Therefore, let us make a covenant with our guns, to put away all these wives and their children, according to the counsel of my Lord, and of those who tremble at the commandment of our God, and let it be done according to the law. arise where it is your task and we are with you, be strong, and do it. This too, is a story where we see a significant challenge posed to a man of God. Contextually, Ezra has just arrived in Palestine in Jerusalem after journeying all the way from Persia, and he's come to set things in order. And immediately after his arrival, he discovers that the Jews have a serious problem with intermarriage with the people of the land. And this is nothing less than an epic spiritual disaster. Because as they and Ezra know very well, one of the things that led the Jews to be carried off into exile in the first place, was their habit of engaging in these unlawful marriages and being corrupted to serve idols, and thereby incurring the wrath of God. So Ezra comes in, and he finds this dire situation. And if we were to take the time to look at Ezra nine, Ezra is very aware that the results of this sin might be that they are carried off into captivity again, except this time, they are never going to return. So there is this great big problem. And the only person who can fix it is Ezra, he is the one who is in the right position, he is the one who has the right understanding. And so check and I tells him, this is your job, you need to step up, and you need to do what you know is right. We can often find ourselves in a similar position. There are going to be times in our lives, when we are called upon to make a stand for what we know is right. This could occur at any number of levels. This could be a private stand, simply a defiant declaration to the devil that no we are never going to practice that secret sin again. It could be a situation in our families, where a loved one isn't doing right and they need us to step up. It could come up in our workplaces, it could come up in our churches. There are times in all of these situations, when we will have to stand up for what we know is right. Whatever the situation, we can be assured that when we are called upon to take that stand, if we take it, it will be lonely. That is after all, the nature of taking a stand. Taking a stand means that you aren't looking around sideways to see what everybody else is doing. You are doing the right thing because what regardless of what anybody else is going to do. If that's where we are, if the right thing to do is clearly before us, but we are fighting fear. As we are confronting this situation. We must remember that when we are taking a stand for Jesus, no matter how lonely we may feel, no matter no matter how lonely we may appear to be, we are never alone. Because if we are doing the right thing that He promises us, that He will be with us and He will give us the strength that we need to overcome. Now this overcoming might not look like the world thinks of overcoming. There were men of God who took a stand and triumphed in earthly terms. That the Bible also tells us the stories of men of God who took a stand and who suffered for it in earthly terms. A positive outcome in this life for fearlessly doing the right thing is not guaranteed. But What is guaranteed is that if we do then it will find favor with God

Matt Bassford  19:56
and the outcome of eternal glory that is the outcome that matters. For all of us who are here this evening, let's pause to consider where we are. Let's pause to consider what our lives look like. Are we people who are committed to doing all things through the strength that gives us? Are we people who are committed to fearless service, fearless confrontation with the devil? Because we know that Christ is on our side? Or instead, are we succumbing to fear? are we failing to serve? are we failing even to live righteously? Because we have not put our lives at the feet of Jesus. If this latter is true of you, and let me encourage you this evening, to make your life right with God. It may be that you are somebody who has never done this, that you have tried to make your way through life without the Lord's help in any way. And if that's so then I would suggest to you that regardless of what else is going on in your life, that is the first problem that you need to solve. It's something that you can solve in the same way that people have solved it for 1000s of years, by obeying the gospel, by being baptized for the forgiveness of your sins and becoming a disciple of Jesus. And then once you do that, then every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places will belong to you. It could also be that you are somebody who has done that. But rather than pressing on to the salvation of the soul, you have chosen instead to shrink back to disruption. The devil with the fear that he likes to wield. Has you convinced that the only way for you to save your life is to forsake Jesus. If that's so, recognize tonight that the devil is lying to you as he lies to everybody. There is no salvation to be found in this world. There is no lasting joy to be found in sin. Those things can only come from the hand of Jesus. If you need our help in returning to him, then we'd be happy to pray with you. But whatever your position, it's pointless, continuing to live a life of fear. Start living a life of faith instead come while we stand. And what was it
