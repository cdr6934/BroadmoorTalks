Well, good morning to everybody. It's good to see you here. We're a little few in number, aren't we? Well, that's okay. We're getting used to having to deal with this. Again, I'll say it's not exactly what we want. But it's good to be here. And it's good to worship with you. So I'm glad that you're here with me. And if you're watching online, I'm glad that you're here, as well. You know, it's not a newsflash to tell you that we live in a sin and sinful and fallen world. It's almost like our phones remind us all the time, Dean, someone else said, dang. Here's the case for someone since then, Dane, here's a story of sin. We live in a sinful world. You know, the internet and the online world has really changed things. In many ways. I'm sure you've heard me talk about this in sermons and there's a lot of investigation and cultural social critique about why all the things are happening the way they are, and, and what's going on with our world right now. I'm going to continue that and talk about a couple of things that I see in the online world right now. And that is that prestige or esteem is garnered by the amount of attention that you can receive. So someone is pleased with themselves if they can get a tremendous number of likes, or a tremendous number of hits. But we've also come to see interaction between people is something that happens, not so much between people, but it's between a faceless screen between cartoonish avatars and pixels. And so we've stopped relating with individuals with people, as people. You combine that with our political difficulties in this country of, of there's two sides, good and evil, of course, whatever side you're on the good side, and whatever side the other people are on, that is the the evil side. So all of this has created really what I believe is a toxic environment for for dialogue, for people being able to come together. And one of the prevalent aspects of our society that is really coming to the fore over and over again is this need for revenge and vindication, revenge and vindication? In the book, The coddling of the American mind by Greg Lukianoff, and Jonathan Haidt, the authors describe our culture as a call out culture, which is the new prestige economy, they say, part of this call out culture is the fact that you get credit based on what someone else has said when you call it out. So you look good and profound, when you call someone out is doing something that is wrong. Now, I will say this, that identifying sin is a good and necessary thing. preachers have been doing that for generations, right? Christians are called to identify sin. And so that's something that needs to happen. We can't stop violence if we don't identify the violence that is occurring or racism if we don't identify or, or lies and error if we don't identify those things. The problem is not identifying what is wrong. The problem is the manner in which we do it. So it's important how we identify sin. In our call out culture, everyone is looking to trip other people up. People are judged harshly if they offend. And this involves going back years and years and years and finding a single post that someone wrote and trying to get them fired, or trying to cause great difficulty upon them. People are judged harshly if they offend, and that's true, whether they intended to offend or not. And so in the midst of our diverse society, people are learning to look for the worst in each other, and expect the worst in each other. And there's no benefit in that. The author state this there's no benefit of the doubt. There's no forgiveness. Everyone's on eggshells, and this doesn't help anyone. People end up claiming out afraid that they might say the wrong thing, even if it's on accident, because the mob, the online online mob is quick and eager to call out to pile on. And after all, it's just a bunch of pixels. For right now there are people behind those pixels. There are people and we need to remember that.

Jeremy Sweets  04:57
When we identify sin, we can't be like the Prophet. Jonah, who delighted in the downfall of others, if this is the case, we need to understand that we are the actual sinner, walking around with a plank in our while we identify the specks, and build those up in the other. And so revenge and vindication are hallmarks of our society. And I believe it's doing nothing but really creating a prison for our society. It's doing nothing but creating bondage for our society and the people in it. But I want you to know that this is not the character of a Christian. The character of a Christian is defined by forgiveness. Forgiveness lies at the heart of our faith and the gospel message. And I believe that forgiveness can release us from the chains of continuous blind condemnation. We need to be a people known by our forgiveness. So this morning, I'd like to talk about the freedom of forgiveness we just spent yesterday and kind of this weekend thinking about the freedoms of our country. And we're blessed to be able to have those freedoms, we were able to escape the tyranny of, of England a couple of 100 years ago, and lack of representation. So we escaped that and we have our independence, we have our freedom. I believe that that vindication, revenge and all that really is a tyranny to us, it's it's self imposed in many ways, and there is a true freedom in forgiveness. Notice in Colossians, chapter three, the Scripture reading that was read for us. There it says that were to put away certain things as Christians and we are also put on certain things as Christians. Notice what he says in verse eight, but now you must put them all away anger, wrath, malice, slander, and obscene talk from your mouth, where to put away anger and slander word to put away from us wrath and malice, hatred towards others. Instead of that Christians are to put on compassionate hearts, kindness, humility, meekness and patience, bearing with one another and if one has a complaint against another, forgiving each other, as the Lord has forgiven you. So you also must forgive. And above all, these put on love, which binds everything together in perfect harmony. Were called to be lights in the world, and I believe we stand has a stark contrast to the world when we are eager and ready to forgive others, when we seek their benefit even in the midst of their wrongdoing, when we seek to redeem that which has fallen, and bring it to that which brings glory to God, we will stand in stark contrast to the world when we live a life of forgiveness, a life of forgiveness. So notice first, first of all, some ways that we are enslaved when we fail to forgive, we are enslaved to a failure to forgive. And I'll tell you this as well, if you look up the word antonym for forgiveness, I don't know that there is one.

Jeremy Sweets  08:22
There's not a single word that I could find that's an antonym. In fact, there's a whole group of words that are used to describe the attitude that refuses to forgive. And so I'll be picking up on different aspects of what's involved. When you withhold forgiveness. There's malice there's holding against, there's all these things that's involved. And so we are enslaved when we refuse to give forgiveness and one of the things we're enslaved to is a tunnel vision. I don't know if you've ever been driving in your car and it's a beautiful day out you can see all around you I think about in the Smoky Mountains, they have a few different tunnels that you might go through and you just see the beauty of creation until you enter that tunnel. And then you can only see one thing you can see one thing at the far end of the tunnel and that is the light, everything else is blocked out. Everything else is blocked out. When you refuse to offer and extend forgiveness, you develop tunnel vision. You become obsessed with one thing getting revenge or one thing the harm that was done to you and you're unable to see anything else. Proverbs 19 In verse 19, says, A man of great wrath will pay the penalty for if you deliver him, you will only have to do it again. An angry man will fall into the cycle of being angry again and again. And again. He's stuck in that cycle, replaying the same scenario over and over and over again. And so it is one. So it is with one that will not forgive, they are stuck with a very small vision so that they can only see one thing they don't see the broader perspective, we don't see the broader perspective when we refuse to forgive. And that that creates a very dangerous scenario for us tunnel vision, only seeing that the harm that was done to us, we're also enslaved to bitterness, to bitterness. Paul describes forgiveness is really coming with a fork in the road, you can choose either bitterness or forgiveness in Ephesians 431 through 32. Now this is an amidst of passage where he says again, just like we read in Colossians, put off this and put on this in verse 31. He says, Let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and slander be put away with from you, along with all malice. That's one path to choose. You can choose to be angry, and have clamor and slander and have your heart full of malice. And the first word that he mentions, there is bitterness, that can be a choice you make. The other way is the path of forgiveness. He says, but be kind to one another, tender hearted, forgiving one another as God in Christ forgave you. When someone has done us wrong, we have a choice to make. We can we can develop bitterness in our hearts, which really will will make us slaves to that bitterness, or we can decide to release it's to forgive, to be gracious toward that individual. When Cain sacrifice was not pleasing to God, he was angry, the text says and his face Phil, the Lord said to Cain, though, when that happened, why are you angry? And why has your face fallen? If you do, well, will you not be accepted. And if you do not do well, sin is crouching at the door. His desire is contrary to you, but you must rule over it. I see this really, Cain was angry at Abel, even though Abel did nothing to him, but he took it out on a table. I'm mad at him because of what I have done. And the advice that God gives Cain is good for us to consider when someone has done us wrong. He says, if you do well, will you not be accepted, we can change our attitude and change our hearts so that we decided to do what's right. But if we decide to allow bitterness to reign in our hearts, sin is crouching at the door. And his desire is for us to devour us. And so we must rule over it. We have a choice to make between bitterness, and forgiveness, you know, bitterness and anger and all those things. All they do is fester. And they take root.

Jeremy Sweets  13:15
Bitterness, I believe is like radiation poisoning. You know, there are people that that survived the atomic bomb. There was that immediate blast that impact of harm. And there were people that survived that but a lot of those people were in, in they they receive the radiation poisoning. And so that inside them, it destroyed them from the inside. That's what bitterness does. You may survive the harm that was done to you. But you have this bitterness that is eating you up from the inside out and destroys you. When you refuse to forgive you're enslaved to bitterness. You're also enslaved to a harmful intent or harmful intent for another if not all others. A bitter heart seeks to harm of another. When sorry, someone harms us our initial reaction is to be able to retaliate and harm them back. If they did that to me. Watch what I do to them. When we fail to forgive we become consumed with their destruction. We become consumed with destruction, and brighten placing that upon another. And Genesis form verse 23. Lane Mack said he had two wives. It says that he bragged to them I have killed a man for wounding me, a young man for striking me. You know the law said that, that the governing authority shall enact a punishment of an eye for an eye the punishment should fit the crime. But Lane Max says I don't need the government myself. If someone harms me, if someone wounds me or strikes me, I'll put them to death. And that is the type of attitude that someone that seeks to retaliate, has retaliation, escalates and grows. Very few people say you hurt me, I'm going to try to hurt you the exact same amount of no more. That's not how that works, is it? Now they want to put them under. They want to do them harm. And so we see that someone that is refusing to forgive they are enslaved to harmful intent. What about getting even sometimes we've used that language when someone hurts us, we retaliate. We want to hurt them just like they hurt us we want to get even Bible though, says that getting even is not our job. It's not our job, we're not really equipped to be able to judge justly, eternal matters like that. Our job is not to be the execution. Our job is rather to leave vengeance to God. In Romans 12, verse 17, it says, repay no one evil for evil goes on to say that beloved, never avenge yourselves, but leave it to the wrath of God. For it is written Vengeance is mine. I will repay, says the Lord. The problem is when we try to get even we actually do. Someone did evil to us. And what do we do? We do evil as well? Aren't we on the same plane? As they are? Aren't we? Aren't we the same kind of person that they are when we seek to do evil in return? When we get even sadly we do. And that is on a sinful plane.

Jeremy Sweets  17:01
We're also enslaved to a double standard, a double standard. If someone harms us or someone I love, and we're gonna do everything we can to harm them. But that's not the treatment we expect or want from others, we expect to be forgiven. We expect to be able to have our slides forgiven from us. When Peter came to the Lord, he asked this question in Matthew 18, in verse 21. Lord, how often will my brother sinned against me, and I forgive him? As many as seven times? Jesus said to him, I do not say to you seven times, but 77 times, no doubt, Peter thought that he was being generous by extending forgiveness seven times. You know, we often wonder how often should we forgive someone? What if they persist in their actions? What if they do something over and over again? When does it end? If I forgive them twice? Isn't that too much? I've already forgiven them once, maybe three. And so Peter extends it maybe seven times what is the amount I should extend forgiveness? And Jesus said that you should not portion out forgiveness in that regard. It should be freely given. After that question. In response, Jesus tells a parable about a man that was forgiving a large sum. This is the parable of the unforgiving servant. The king forgave the man he was ready to punishing but he begged for his life. He begged for forgiveness and the king offered Him forgiveness. But what did he do? He went out and found his neighbor who owed him a penance and compared to what he owed the king, and he threw him in the presence that you'll pay me, you'll pay? Isn't that what we do with others? We have this double standard, we expect forgiveness. When we're contrite and sorry, we expect others to forgive us, but we're not willing to extend that to others. That's a hard standard to live up to. And it can be an enslaving standard. When we refuse to forgive, I believe that we are in slave to our own sinful attitude there and it does us much harm. It does us much harm. On the flip side of that, I believe that there is liberation. In forgiveness, there is liberation in forgiveness, there is a a freeing aspects to forgiveness. First of all, it provides a context for pain. Revenge in a person's heart simply amplifies the pain. It caused one to dwell upon the hurt that was done without considering anything else. It simply amplifies the pain. Forgiveness does not take the pain away. But it can provide a helpful context for the pain. When we were hurt or injured, we were hurt and injured by a sin plagued individual who is a native of the gospel saying is something that people commit they're perpetrators, but also believe they're victims of sin as well. And that is they are caught up in the things of sin and they are a victim to their own decisions and choices. The unrepentant sinner is under a death penalty separated from God. And we need to understand that on June 17 2015, a 21 year old white supremacist walked into an African American Methodist Episcopal Church and he opened fire. And he did this trying to kill as many people as he could. And this was in the middle of a worship service. He killed nine individuals and injured one other. One of those killed was the wife of Pastor Anthony Thompson. And when he went to the courtroom, he had an opportunity to face the man that had taken what he held most dearly. His wife had taken him from him. And he said, This son, I forgive you, my family forgives you. But we would like you to take this opportunity to repent, repent and confess give your life to the one that matters the most Christ so that he can change it and change your ways. Do that, and you will be better off than you are right now. Now, I don't think that for a moment, his willingness to forgive took away his pain took away the sorrow that he felt. But I do believe it provided a context for his pain and allowed him to, to continue to heal through that process. When we refuse to do that we simply amplify the pain. And so forgiveness gives that context.

Jeremy Sweets  22:02
Forgiveness and the liberation of forgiveness also acknowledges sin acknowledges sin. Some people think of forgiveness as simply ignoring of the sin or acting like it didn't happen or saying that this never occurred. And that's not the case. Forgiveness acknowledges sin and that a willful harm took place. It does not simply ignore it, it does not overlook the problem and hope that it simply goes away with time. No, forgiveness says this wrong occurred. And I forgive. This is why repentance is so necessary and importance in forgiveness. And Luke 17 verses three and four. Jesus says, If your brother sins rebuke him, point out the sin, rebuke him. And if he repents forgive him. And if he sins against you seven times in a day and turns to you seven times saying I repent, you must forgive him. Now true forgiveness demands the repentance of the sinner because that deals with the sin and allows forgiveness to take place. And so I believe that true forgiveness requires that, but also believe that we have a responsibility to act in a certain way in the face of someone that does not repent, and what is that way, we have an obligation to release the bitterness from our heart, to extend grace to them, and to stay and eager and ready to forgive? And we may be like Mr. Anthony Thomas's says in the face of that I forgive you and I want you to repent, I understand his words. And I don't fault him for that to saying this is my attitude. It's an attitude of forgiveness. I'm ready and willing, I'm ready and willing, and that needs to be our disposition. We need to have a forgiving disposition at all times, even if the other one does not repent. Our attitude shouldn't be any different. And that is we will do what is best for them. And that means that they deal with their sin, and they turn away from us and repent, and true forgiveness can take place. We can take a step with our attitude and having that forgiving disposition. But acknowledging sin is so necessary in dealing with and bringing about this liberation of forgiveness.

Jeremy Sweets  24:36
We also need to desire the good. You know, forgiveness turns bitterness and hatred on its head. Someone seeking revenge only wants to harm the other person wants to bring as much damage them as they felt like that they had to endure but forgiveness turns that on its head and means desiring what is good for the other person not seeking their harm, but seeking their good In Romans 12, I read earlier in verse 17. It said repay no man evil for evil. Don't try to do harm when you feel like you've experienced harm, but it says in verse 20, to the contrary, if your enemy is hungry, feed him, if he is thirsty, give him something to drink. For By so doing, you will heap burning coals on his head. Do not be overcome by evil but overcome evil with good. The enemy comes to you, you have a chance to get back at him, what do you do? Do you doing harm? Now, Paul says you do him good. Because that's the kind of person you are seeking what is good and right. Your character does not change dependent upon what someone else does to you. We don't say that, as a Christian, I want to do what's right, as long as they did right to me. Now, the Christian says, I'm going to do what's right period, regardless of what anyone else does to me. And I love that phrase at the end, because it really encapsulates much of this sermon. Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good, we are not to be over calm, by evil. And this is the prison that I'm talking about when we seek revenge, when we seek to retaliate, when that consumes our mind, and we have bitterness in our heart we are overcome. And we are overcome by evil. The tech says that we are not to be overcome by evil, but we are to be overcomers. of evil with good. And so we see we must desire what is good. And another. Peter makes a similar message in first Peter three nine, Do not repay evil for evil or reviling for reviling. But on the contrary, bless. For to this you were called that you made attain a blessing. Do not retaliate. But bless, seek what is good for the other one. This involves as well extending love and charity, forgiveness and is an extension of love and not hate. In Colossians, three and 14, Paul concludes his statement of forgiveness with these words. And above all these put on love which binds everything together in perfect harmony. We need to put into practice the saying that we often say As Christians, we hate the sin, but we love the sinner. That's true when the sin was committed against us, against us. We hate that sin that took place. But even though someone hurt us, we still love the sin. We love them. We extend love and compassion and kindness to them. Because no matter what they've done, there's someone that's been created by our Creator made in the image of God. No matter what they've done, they have a soul that is at stake, held as most valuable by Almighty God, no matter what they've done, they are of value to God, and they should be a value to us. Yes, we have to extend love and kindness to another. Love acknowledges the worth and value of every person and every person. And so that liberates us if we can extend love instead of being held in the cage of hate. Not only that, but we also need to practice Grace practice grace. Grace refers to an merited favor, is not given because it's deserved. It's not like a job where someone works a certain number of hours and they earn their pay. That's not why and how grace is given. But it's given not because it's earned but in order that it might heal and restore another in Ephesians, four and 32 it says Be kind to one another tender hearted, forgiving one another as God and Christ forgave you. Another way to translate this, there's several different words for forgive. But this is the word of being gracious, being gracious, be kind to one another tender hearted being gracious to one another, as God in Christ has been gracious to you. We have received the grace of God through Jesus Christ, and we are to extend that to others. I believe that grace has a liberating effect it can pull someone caught up in the vicious cycle of sin and retaliation and it can bring them out of that rut and show them another way.

Jeremy Sweets  29:55
Not because they deserved it. Not because they're actually I brought that forth and they earned it. But because they are valuable and they need it, they need it. It can show them another way. Now, I hope you've seen that from everything we've talked about here. This is the gospel. Everything I'm talking about with forgiveness is the Gospel. The Gospel provides for us a context for the pain that we feel and it is comes from Satan, and from the sinful choices that we make. But we must acknowledge that sin, we realize that we desire what is good or rather, I should say that God has desired what is good for us. God has called us extending to us love and grace. As Christians, we are recipients of God's grace and forgiveness. And we can't forget that. In Romans five and verse six, he says, For while we were still weak, at the right time, Christ died for the ungodly, and verse it says, But God shows His love for us and that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us. Since therefore, we have now been justified by His blood, much more shall we be saved by Him from the wrath of God? Christ died for us even when we were enemies, even when we were harming him, even when we were hurting him with our sin, Christ died for us. The Bible also teaches us that when we refuse to forgive, we destroy ourselves and put our own forgiveness at risk. In Matthew six verses 14 and 15, provided as an explanation to the prayer. Forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors. They're in the Lord's Prayer. It says this, For if you forgive others their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. But if you do not forgive others their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses. Yes, we must forgive others, because God has forgiven us. Let us not practice that double standard of expecting God to forgive us but yet refusing it to others. In forgiveness, I believe that we can serve a much larger purpose of demonstrating the gospel message and pointing others to God. When we seek retaliation, it is a selfish interest. It is a selfish interest that imprisons us, and in prisons, the one we retaliate, but when we forgive, we can demonstrate the gospel and point others to God. We often sing a song, a channel only, we're going to be channels of God's grace. We're not the source of grace or forgiveness. But we can carry that grace and forgiveness in a sense or point others people point other people to it. You probably have ditches in your yard, most of most of us have ditches that that carries the water to another place where we can show carry God's grace and the gospel message to others. In this song, we sang how I praise the precious Savior, that thy love light hold of me that was saved and cleansed and filled me that I might die channel be. channels only bless it master but with all thy wondrous power, flowing through flowing through us, thou canst use us every day and every hour. Let us be a pupil of forgiveness and channels of God's forgiveness. If you're not a Christian, and you're here this morning, or if you're listening through the stream, we need to understand that forgiveness is freely offered by God to those who believe repent, confess, and are baptized. Those actions do not earn your salvation. But God says they are necessary for those that seek to be saved. You can be freed from the grip of sin and the slavery of guilt and shame, if you will but fall upon the mercies of the Lord and ask for it. And so we see the necessity, the need of forgiveness, and the prison of retaliation. There's any subject to the invitation please come as we stand seen at this time.
