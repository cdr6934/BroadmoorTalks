Good evening. It's good to see everyone here tonight. It's good that we can come here and worship our God. If you would open your Bibles to Exodus chapter three, Exodus chapter three, we'll look tonight at that text. I think it's always been within human nature to notice unusual sightings or curiosities to see things that are unusual. We just are attracted to that. And in this internet, internet age, we see that all the more people share things that seem to be unusual, whether it be some animal that's going along doing something or some trick that somebody is doing. If you're at a house with kids, you hear that a lot. Hey, did you see Mom? Did you see this or I saw that, in Exodus chapter three, there's a curiosity that sure surely grabbed the attention of Moses there and it wasn't grabbed any of our attention. Moses saw a burning bush that was not being burned, it was not being consumed. It was simply on fire. And the text says that he said, I will turn aside to see this great site, why the bush is not burned in verse three. And so we see that Moses saw a great curiosity. Well, I'd like to talk for just a few moments tonight about why the burning bush spoke. If you thought it was a curiosity to see this bush that was burning without being consumed, it became even more of a curiosity when it spoke, and it spoke the word of the Lord. So I'd like to look for a few moments tonight at why the burning bush spoke, why it spoke. First of all, it had a message for Moses. And that message is God is holy, God is holy. Notice in verse four, says, When the Lord saw that he turned assigned to see God call to him out of the bush, Moses, Moses, and he said, Here I am. Notice in verse five, then he said, Do not come near, take your sandals off your feet for the place on what's your standing is holy ground, holy ground.

Jeremy Sweets  02:22
Why was the ground holy? What made it holy? Well, we saw earlier in this text that it refers to hora, or the mountain of God, this ground was holy, not because the dirt was so special or so unique, but rather because this is where God was. This is where God was dwelling. And it's not the ground, so to speak, that was holy, it was the God that was holy, the God who spoke and is because that's where he was that the ground became holy. One of the things we see all throughout Scripture is that we serve a holy God. God is holy. And one way we might think about that is there is no sin within God, there is no imperfection, there is no darkness. The text often says, God is pure. God is right. There is no sin or no defect within God whatsoever. His character is holy. Now, the way you might think about holiness is something that is set apart or separated. And certainly God is distinct or different from every mere human that has ever lived. We sin, but God does not. In Isaiah chapter six and verse three, Isaiah is captured up into the throne of heaven and a vision, and he sees God there. And we see that there are angels about saying, Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts. The whole earth is full of his glory, where God is, wherever he is, that is a special place. And as God in a special way inhabited this mountain, he says that you are standing on holy ground. That same image is seen again in Revelation where it talks about the throne scene, those were around, we're saying, Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty, who was and is and is to come. Revelation chapter four and verse eight, this eternal God is a holy God. And Moses needed to hear that God is holy. So what should our reaction be? Well, even more than a curiosity that draws our attention in we need to understand that we, when we look upon God, it demands our attention or His Holiness demands our attention. our attention and our respect, our admiration, we should understand how special it is that we serve a holy God, especially when we see so much sin around us. And we know that we ourselves have sin. When we look upon God, it demands our honor, our respect, and our praise. But even that more than that, His Holiness calls us to be holy as well, in First Peter chapter one and verse 614, through 16. There it says, As obedient children, do not be conformed to the passions of your former ignorance. But as he who called you is holy, you also be holy in all your conduct. Since it is written, you should be holy, for I am holy. Yes, God's holiness demands our respect, our honor, our praise, but it also calls us to be something different than we are. It calls us to holiness, as well. So why did the burning bush speak? Well, first of all, to tell Moses that God is holy. Notice, second of all, that God wanted to relay the message that he hears the cries of the afflicted, he hears the cries of the afflicted. Notice in verse seven, then the Lord said, I have surely seen the affliction of my people who are in Egypt. And I've heard their cry because of their taskmasters. I know, they're suffering. We've been talking about that in our Exodus class,

Jeremy Sweets  06:32
on Sunday mornings, but in case you were not here for that we see in Exodus chapter one, that the population of Israel grew. And Pharaoh became afraid of such a large foreign population in his midst. And so he said that he was going to try to control the population. And he did that, first of all, by difficult, hard labor. And second of all, he did that by trying to simply murder the babies of the Israelites. And so we see it was a very difficult existence. It was a very hard time for the Israelites. And at the end of chapter two, it says that Israel cried out to God, they cried out in their pain, they cried out because of the slavery, and God heard their cries, God heard their sorrow, God heard their pain. And as God comes to Moses here, he wants him to know that I have surely heard the cries of the afflicted. You know, God is not one who has only heard 1000s of years ago, it's not as if that's the only time that God has heard. God is one that continues to hear the cries of the afflicted, the cries of the oppressed. One of the difficult things about that is sometimes we feel like God doesn't here. And there could be a large issue here with timing. We're very finite creatures. We, our life has been a vapor. And so we see things on a limited scale, but the eternal God sees things from a different perspective. And an eternal God has the wisdom, to be able to deal with things on a larger scale. You know, in Psalm 10, and verse one, the Psalmist says this, wondering if God hears Why, oh, Lord, do you stand far away? Why do you hide yourself in times of trouble? Later on in that Psalm in verses 10 through 12, it says, The helpless are crushed, they sink down and fall by his mind. He says, in his heart, God has forgotten he has hidden his face, he will never see it. Oh, rise, oh, Lord, oh, God, lift up your hand, forget not the afflicted. Sometimes I will, dealing with this issue of sorrow and pain is a difficult issue as

Jeremy Sweets  09:06
God hears us. God hears those that are in pain, but he does not always step in and intervene. He doesn't immediately stop the pain and so many people that are suffering from the pain often ask why? They asked, When is this going to end? How much longer must this take place? Because it seems like evil is continuing and evil is winning. The text here reminds us though that God hears he hears the cries of the afflicted. Again, I say it's hard to understand we know the end of Exodus, we know that God steps in and leads his people out of Egypt. We don't know how long that Pharaoh was afflicting the Israelites. But at least while Moses was away in Midian, which was a 40 year period, they were in affliction. There were are some people in Egypt, who were Israelites that never saw an in I'm sure there were people that had died during that time that never saw the answer to their cries. They never saw the Exodus, they never saw God's mighty hand and they were simply left in their pain and then their sorrow, crying out to God. The text tells us and reminds us, though, that God had heard their cries, and God had a plan for them, God would provide for them. But again, we're left with this difficulty of the difference in time, we can see that with children, often they'll want to know why, or when can this happen? When is the journey going to end and as parents, we may have a GPS or we may have something that tells us the time frame or we might simply have that in our mind. But children don't always understand that. We've had to start saying with Azure, it's three sleeps, or four sleeps, you know, they, they don't even begin to understand those hours and days and times. And so it is with us and our finite ability. We don't always understand. And so it does take trust, because we don't see immediate results. We don't have immediate, a wiping away of sorrow and pain, we still must endure those things from time to time. But we must know and understand that God hears us, that God hears us and God will provide that takes trust on our part. That's why it's important for us to rely on that first point that God is holy. God is a loving God, God is a good God. And so that helps us grapple with this problem of pain and suffering. If God were an evil god, we couldn't maybe count on what he might do if he were capricious, or he would go about doing one thing one time and completely change another time, we wouldn't be able to count on God. But that's not the God we serve. We serve a holy, loving, good, kind God. And so even if we can't see how things work out immediately, we can trust him. We can trust him. Yes, he hears the cries of the afflicted.

Jeremy Sweets  12:20
God also wanted or the burning bush also spoke, and in order to say that God intended to deliver his people, it was not God's desire that they simply languish in suffering and pain, it was not his desire that they stay in their suffering. God said in verse eight, I have come down to deliver them out of the hands of the Egyptians, and the bring them up out of the land to a good and broad land, a land flowing with milk and honey, to the place of the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Amorites, the parasites, the hip bites, and the Jebusites. Notice, our good God has good intentions, he wants good things for his people. And so he says, that I have come down to deliver them, to bring them out of their pain. That's God's desire, I have come not only to bring them out of their pain, but to take them to a good place to a good land, and to lead them to the land of Canaan, the land of promise. Yes, God wants good things for his people. God desires to deliver his people, not only those that were in Egypt, but I think that's a constant characteristic of God. He always wants good things for his people, because he is a good God. And that's one of the reasons that he hates sin so much. He hates sin so much because it tears us up, it destroys us it gray, gray brings pain upon us. God is not a God that delights in sin or those that commit sin, or the punishment that comes about afterward. And Ezekiel chapter 18, and verse 23, God says, Have I any pleasure in the death of the wicked, declares the Lord, and not rather that he should turn away from his way and live? God doesn't delight in wickedness. He doesn't delight in the punishment that comes about because of wickedness. Sin leads people in a path and direction away from God. And God hates that, because He wants everyone to be his trial. And Ezekiel 33, in verse 11, there it says, As I live, declares the Lord, I have no pleasure in the death of the wicked, but that the wicked turn from his way and live turned back turned back from your evil ways, for Why will you die oh house of Israel. God takes no delight in the depths of the wicked, but notice where the choice lies. It's not up to God, whether the wicked will continue on their path away from him. It's not up to God. He gives us all that choice whether we will follow after him. Or if we follow a path of sin, if we'll repent, if we will turn back and come back to him. God promises that we will have repentance, if we turn away from our sin, we'll have forgiveness rather when we repent. And so he calls upon people to repent and turn back to him. Not only is he a good God, and does not enjoy the death that would come upon the wicked, but he wants us to have good things just as he wanted to lead the Israelites into Canaan, and to give them land. He wants all people to be saved. In First Timothy two verses three and four, there it says, This is good, and it is pleasing in the sight of God, our Savior, who desires all people to be saved, and to come to the knowledge of the truth. God doesn't want anybody to perish. He wants us all to be say, he's a good God, a holy God, that hears the cries of the afflicted, that sees the pain of sin. And He wants us all to be delivered. In Second Peter three in verse nine, and there it says, The Lord does not slow about his promises, some count slowness, but is patient towards you, not wishing that any should perish. but that all should come to repentance. God doesn't want anyone to die. He doesn't want anyone to experience the pain of sin, his desire is that every single person would be saying, but again, it's not his choice to make. He leaves that up to us. And so he allows time it says in Second Peter three, he allows his word to go for the call people to repentance. That's what he wants. That's what He desires. You may be here tonight, and you say, I don't know what I want with my life. I don't know what I'm supposed to do with my life. God calls you to follow after Him. God calls you to repent and make things right so that you can be in fellowship with him.

Jeremy Sweets  17:04
Why did the burning bush speak? Well, it's spoken order, say that God will deliver his people. And as I mentioned, we know the end of the story, don't we know God did just that he did deliver his people? Well, in verses nine and 10, we talked about here, the burning bush, we sometimes talk about the call of Moses. Well, God chose that individual Moses, in order to lead the people out. Notice in verses nine and 10, there says, And now behold, the cry of the people of Israel has come to me, and I have seen the oppression with which the Egyptians have pressed them, Come, I will send you to Pharaoh, that you may bring my people, the children of Israel out of Egypt. Notice what God says the Moses, yes, I have seen their suffering, I have heard their cries. And now I want you to enact my plan to bring the people out. God doesn't step into history with a literal hand and begin to make changes. But rather God uses individuals doesn't mean God uses people. He uses those that would be able to carry out his work. And so we can be a part of that. I've heard phrases like that when we look at the gospel that someone said that we are the fifth gospel of those that will go out those that will preach those that will proclaim those that will do his will. We are to be workers today. We are to be ones that work today. God will not call us in the same way. I think that that he called Moses by saying I have this specific task, and this is what I want you to do. But he has spoken in His Word about his will. And we are to be the workers. The church has to be busy. So the question is, how will you respond to the call? will you respond like Moses will not take a lot of time to look at what happens? Moses response. But in the end of chapter three and heading into chapter four, we see that Moses makes five excuses. As he responds to this call of whether he will serve he first of all says that he is inadequate. He says in chapter three, verse 11, who am I that I should go? And maybe we can feel some sense of that, as Moses stood before a holy God. We could feel the smallness maybe that he would feel but he relates that to his task. God says, I chose you and he says, No, Who am I that I should go? Well, God responds, I will be with you. In chapter three in verse 13, he questions about ignorance. He says how respond to the people when they ask your name. What if I don't know the right answer? God says, I will give you the name and you can teach them that I am, sent you. And he tells him his name. And the third case, he he asked about incredibility. What if they will not believe me? Or listen to me? What if they don't respond as I want them to? It's too incredible. And they might not listen to me. God says, I will give you the power to perform miracles. I will show you what is incredible that will point them to the message. In Chapter Four in verse 10, Moses says, I'm inarticulate. I can't speak well, I'm not able to perform as I would like, I'm not an eloquent speaker. And God said, I made man's mouth. And I will teach you what to say. And finally, in chapter four, in verse 13, Moses responds with insubordination. And he simply says, Send someone else. This is not for me. And God says, We'll take Aaron and go, and you go, what are each one of those excuses start with? Each one of those excuses starts with ah, and I think that's where we fall off track a lot of times, isn't it? When God gives us His mission, his purpose, he gives us the actions that we're to carry out a lot of times, we turn that away from what he wants us to do to ourselves, we say, I'm not worthy, I'm not studied enough, I don't have the ability, this is for someone else, this is not something I want to do.

Jeremy Sweets  21:42
Now, Moses is going to come around, so there's some immaturity in his part that that he is able to overcome, and maybe we all have those bouts of immaturity. So I don't want to be too hard on Moses, he does take up the task. But in this passage, his focus is on himself. And he says, I'm not good enough. You know, sometimes almost think it's a false humility, that says, I can't do this, I'm not good enough for the task that God wants me to do. And so we don't do it. We don't do the work. But God wants us to be busy. God wants us to be workers. So the question is, how will you respond to the call? will you respond like Moses, and focus on yourself? Or will you be ready for the task? will you respond like Isaiah rather and Isaiah chapter six and verse eight, we talked about that throne scene in which God appears before Isaiah. And the statement goes out, holy, holy, holy is the Lord God, almighty. And the question goes forth? Whom shall I send? And who will go? Who will go for us? And notice, Isaiah says, Here I am, send me. That's the attitude we need, isn't it? That's the, that's the desire that we need to have. There is work to do. There's plenty of work to do, and God wants to use you in that work. Will you respond like Moses and say, I'm not good enough? I can't do that. Or will you say, here I am. Send me? Will you jump at the chance to do work for the Lord, we need to be more like Isaiah. I'll simply say there is work for all of us to do, there's more than enough to go around. So you may not do this particular work, but you need to be eager like Isaiah and say, I can do this you need to jump in, you need to do the work. Or it may be that we would pattern our life after the example of Jesus. What did he say? When he was called? What did he do? When he was needed to bring salvation to all people he left the throne of heaven? dittany and he humbled himself. And yes, certainly we need to follow the example of Jesus and Philippians two, verses five through eight, says, Have this mind among yourselves which is yours in Christ Jesus, who though he was in the form of God did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied himself by taking the form of a servant. Being born in the likeness of men and being found in human form, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross. Will we be eager like Isaiah? Will we be sacrificial, like Jesus, who gave himself who lowered himself and gave his all he gave us life for us? How will you sir? Why did the burning bush speak? Well, it spoke in order to tell us that God is holy, that God hears the cries of the afflicted. God's desire was to deliver his people something that He ultimately would accomplish. And he comes to tell Moses that I want you to do the work. I want you to do the work. There's a lot we can learn from that isn't there? There's a lot that we need to see in that it's the same God that we serve the same God that spoke to Moses, and there is still work for us to do today. If you're here tonight, and you're not a Christian, you have an opportunity to obey the gospel message, believing that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living God, repenting of your sins and turning away from those things. Remember, as we talked about, in our text, God says that if you do not repent of your sins, you're headed toward death. And God doesn't want that. Instead, he says, Repent, and so we must repent, we must confess that Jesus is the Christ and we must be baptized in the water for the forgiveness of our sins. If you're here tonight, and you are a Christian, and you're not living as you should remember that you made a lifelong commitment to follow him. So if you're not honoring that, then you also need to repent and change your life. There's anything that we can do with you to help you dedicate your life to God. Please come as we stand in seeing at this time
