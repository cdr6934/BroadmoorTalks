If you're visiting with us, you're our special guest. Our goal here at Broadmoor is to give God glory and praise and honor and all that we do, not only here in this building, but as we leave here in our lives. So we're glad you're here with us. We invite you to open up your Bibles as we study this hour. We're going to be looking at John chapter eight, John chapter eight. If you would like to open your Bibles there. And when I said study this hour, that's an expression if you're visiting.

Before I jump into this text, let me start with an illustration and a question. You have Jack teenager, and Jill teenager, Jill teenager says to her parents, I don't want to be here. I don't like your rules. I want to be free from all of this. I just, you're cramping my style, and you're getting in my way, there's too much here. That is a problem for me, I want to leave, I want to leave home. And she does. When she leaves home, she notices she's missing a lot of what home provided. She is missing home, the provisions of her mother, the provisions of her father, she's missing place of belonging. She's missing the love that her mother and father gave to her. And she says, well, at least I'm free. Now. That's Jill, teenager, Jack teenager, stays at home. He has rules that he has to obey and follow. But he lives with the security that he has with his parents, the love and provisions that both of his parents provide. They're preparing for him to get an education, to have a career to get a job. And so let me just as you look at those two situations, let me ask you the question, which one of those is free? Is it Jack teenager, the one that stays at home or Jill teenager, the one that leaves, see Jill teenager has the freedom doesn't choose to do whatever it is she wants. She can make any choice that she wants. She's not under the restrictions of her parents. Which one of those is free? Well, I'd like to talk this morning about two kinds of freedom. This past week, we celebrated July 4, where we thought about our freedom as a nation, or independence as a nation when that was established. And so as I thought about this concept of freedom. That's really where this came from. But I want to talk about freedom not in terms of something that's provincial or regionals, nothing that just applies to United States. But something that's much broader than that this lesson on freedom really could be spoken to any group of people at any time under any political situation. In John chapter eight, verses 31 through 38, we have two kinds of freedom used. And you see that a little bit in the illustration that I already gave with Jill talking about her freedom from her parents, but then questioning whether Jack had that freedom as well or whether he had freedom. John chapter eight and verse 31. It says this. So Jesus said to the Jews, who had believed him, If you abide in my word, you are truly my disciples, and you will know the truth and the truth will set you free. They answered him, We are all string of Abraham and have never been enslaved to anyone. How is it that you say you will become free? Jesus answered them truly, truly, I say to you, everyone who practices sin as a slave to sin, the slave does not remain in the house forever, the sun remains forever. So if the sun sets you free, you will be free indeed, I know that your offspring of Abraham, yet you seek to kill me because my words find no place in you. I speak of what I've seen with my father and you do and you do what you have from your father. Now, let me just frame this text a little bit and that is that there is great animosity but confrontation between Jesus and the Pharisees. In chapter seven, there are several questions that are asked, Who is this Christ? can this one be the Christ is this one really the prophets? In John chapter seven is Jesus speaks about the fact that I am the light of the world. He receives some questions and some confrontations in John eight in verse 13. They they say the Pharisees here so you can't bear witness of yourself in a court of law. Everyone knows A witness must come from outside you can't bury your own witness. They furthermore say in verse 18, where is your father? They asked in verse 22, Will he kill himself since he says, where I'm going? You cannot come? Is he talking about suicide? There's lots of questions about Jesus and who he is. In verse 25. They simply ask, who are you? In the middle of all these questions, Jesus is telling them who he is. He is the light of the world. He is the Christ. He is the one that has been sent, and he is the one that will be lifted up.

Jeremy Sweets  05:41
And then we come to verse 31. Now, you know, when you're preaching aren't supposed to present all these problems? Well, let me just say in verse 31, it says, So Jesus said to the Jews, who had believed him, I find that description a little bit odd, because we've seen all throughout this text confrontation, and use the deposed him. And you see after this text, the Jews here that uses that same description of the Jews. So what does it mean those Jews who believed him? I don't know if they had believed part of what he had said about being the Christ. But notice how he takes this a step further. So the reason I say I don't know what that means, I'd be happy for you to fill me in. On that, who are these people? Exactly? Is this the same group of confrontation? Is this a subset that had believed some of his words, or another group altogether? He does seem to accuse this group of being after their father. So it's a little bit of confusion there. But let me get past that. He says in verse 31, If you abide in my word, you are truly my disciples, and you will know the truth and the truth will set you free. Jesus offers to the Jews here, freedom. He says, freedom is something you can have and they immediately begin to scratch their head and bewilderment. They immediately say, What do you mean freedom? We we are sons of Abraham, we have never been enslaved. Now, I might give him some lessons on on that. But if you think about the fact that sons of Abraham they had been enslaved, after all in in Egypt, the Hebrews had been enslaved in a Syrian Bible when the Israelites and the nation of Judah had been enslaved. And then even at this time, there was a handcuffing by the Roman Empire. But leave that as it may they, they challenge his use of the word freedom. What do you mean to offer us freedom, we are not living in slavery. We're not in slavery. We don't have people that are masters forcing us to work all day long. And so they challenge his use of the word, freedom. But he says in verse 34, truly I say to you, everyone who practices sin, is a slave of sin. Jesus is not just talking about physical slavery and physical freedom here are national freedom and slavery. But he's talking about something more. And he says that everyone who practices sin is a slave to sin, slave does not remain in the house forever, the sun remains forever. So if the sun sets you free, you will be free indeed. And Jesus underscores the word freedom here, I'm not just talking about national or physical freedom, I'm talking about freedom in deed, or true freedom, what is truly free. And that true freedom is found in Christ. When we look at this, I think we see two kinds of freedom in a physical sense, there's freedom in the world or political freedom. And it's been interesting to think about that subject, it's meant many things in many different times. So let me just walk through that a little bit, knowing that ultimately where you're talking about sin, but here they say freedom, the freedom we're talking about the Jews say that is freedom from slavery or enslavement. And so that's one concept of freedom, being able to make the choices to live life, how you want to make those choices. As we think about the founding of our country, there was a sense of a freedom from tyranny, freedom from an oppressive power, freedom from rules that would take away rights. And so there was the bill of freedom. There was lots of statements on freedom as this country was founded. As you come even a step further, you see that today, Freedom has almost come to mean a A really freedom of choice, the freedom to choose whatever it is that you would like. I'll give you one example of that. And in 2012, there was a law that was passed that legalized homosexual marriage. And the statement was made by the president at that time that now we are all more free today because of that law. And so let me just think a minute about that freedom, how he's using that word. He's saying freedom is the alleviation or the removal of any restriction on our choice.

Jeremy Sweets  10:41
any restriction on our choice, we even politically today debate about whether a choice can be made by someone that would be harmful for them? Can someone smoke? Should we allow them to do that? Should that be their choice? What about drinking alcohol marijuana? Do we have to wear seatbelts? Do we make people make that choice or a helmet, I'm not trying to get into and solve all these political problems. But I'm trying to illustrate this concept of freedom. Freedom is often depicted as something that is unrestrained or it's a freedom to choose no restrictions on choice. And I think that fits in ultimately, ultimately with what Jesus is saying here. Sin is a choice. And it is a choice to serve self. Now, let me say that I appreciate the freedoms of this country. And so I'm not trying to knock that whatsoever. But I do want to make a more important spiritual application about freedom that could fit in with our concept of freedom. And what that's come to mean. Freedom in this world, for many people is something that is simply unrestrained, and it's unrestrained choice, being able to do whatever it is that you want to do. I want you to notice that freedom in Christ is just the opposite. It's not having every choice in the world and be able to do whatever it is that you want to do. But freedom in Christ is restrained to a specific choice, the choice of Christ, and being able to serve Christ and making that commitment. And so we see two kinds of freedom, freedom really in the world or in sin, being able to choose whatever it is you want to do, or freedom in Christ. Let me illustrate what we mean by these categories. And second Peter chapter two. Second Peter chapter two verses 18 and 19. Here it's talking about false teachers, but I think it illustrates this false spirits as well that's alive and well in this freedom and sin are the world. Second Peter to in verse 18, says, for speaking loud boasts of folly, they enticed by sensual passions of the flesh, those who are barely escaping from those who live in air, they promised them freedom, but they themselves are slaves of corruption, for whatever overcomes a person to that he is enslaved. Again, this passage is talking about false prophets, but I think it also illustrates the spirit of error. And notice three components here found in this freedom in the world. There is the enticement, there is this promise of what you get. And that is self satisfaction. You are enticed by it is by what you want, and what you desire. Specifically, in this passage, it talks about sensuality, it talks about sensual passions of the flesh, you can do what you want to do that is the enticement and that is very enticing, isn't it? To do what you want to do. Notice the promise. There is a promise of freedom in this passage, you can do what you want to do, and that is freedom. That is freedom to be able to do whatever it is you want to do. But Peter points out, that that is not true freedom. They themselves are actually slaves and they are slaves of corruption. For whatever overcomes a person to that he is enslaved. And so we see this, this promise or this enticement of self satisfaction, we see this promise of so called freedom, but we see the result is actually slavery here. It's actually slavery. And so you get these pleasures, but they come at a cost. Now consider on the the other side of thing his freedom in Christ, freedom in Christ. There's many passages that can illustrate this. I don't know if maybe this is the best one. But I think it does illustrate the point of freedom in Christ in Galatians, chapter three, verses 13 through 15.

Jeremy Sweets  15:22
Here it says For you are called to freedom brothers, only do not use your freedom as an opportunity for the flesh, but through love, serve one another. For the whole laws fulfilled in one word, you shall love your neighbor as yourself. But if you bite and devour one another, watch out that you are not consumed by one another. Notice here that he says that you are free in Christ, and that's the reference, but do not use your freedom as an opportunity for the flesh. Paul says that freedom is not meant to simply serve self, it's not meant so that you can choose whatever it is that you want to do. But he says that freedom should be submitted, and you should use your freedom to make a voluntary choice to serve one another. And so you are choosing some slavery or servanthood directed toward Christ, and you choose Christ first and foremost and out of that as an outgrowth of that is also a love and serving of your neighbor. And so we see the differences here of freedom in the world or in sin and freedom in Christ, freedom in Christ, it is voluntarily submitting ourselves to a specific course of action. Well, let's notice a few descriptions. Furthermore, of, of these two different ways, freedom in the world, I believe, is an unstable way, and an stable way. We can see in many different places that the temporal result that we get from freedom in the world is instability. In James chapter one, verses six through eight, it says, if any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask God, who gives generously to all without reproach, and it will be given to him. But let him who, But let him ask in faith with no doubting for the one who doubts is like a wave of this wave of the sea that is driven and tossed by the wind. For that person not must not suppose that he will receive anything from the Lord for He is double minded, unstable in all his ways. Here you see this concept of freedom, the ocean, there is a freedom and openness there to the ocean. But notice the description it uses of the ocean, it says that the wave of the sea is driven about and tossed by the wind. That is the picture of one who doubts or is not clear in their thinking here. He goes on to say that the double man did mine is unstable in all his ways. Freedom in the World promises satisfaction and freedom. But the result, I believe, is an instability, instability. and Second Peter chapter two and verse 17, it says they these are waterless spraying things, and myths driven by the storm. Again, there are talks about the false prophets, but I think it includes their way their way of error, and it describes them as waterless springs, and miss, there's no substance that is there, there is nothing substantial, but they are waterless, and Miss at best. In Ephesians, chapter two and verse 12, it uses this language. Remember that you were at that time separated from Christ, alienated from the commonwealth of Israel and strangers to the covenant of promise, having no hope and without God in the world. The freedom that is found in the world results in this. Notice the use of the words in Ephesians chapter two and verse 12, separated from Christ, alienated from the commonwealth of Israel, those that brought about or were given the promises of God, strangers to the covenants of promise, no hope and without God. That is a picture of those that are in the world are unstable, unstable, there is nothing substantial there to hang on to. They are alienated they are strangers, they are separated and they are without hope. There is nothing firm that is there. Ephesians chapter four picks up that image again of being tossed to and fro. It says that we are to grow up into Christ and all things so that we may no longer be children tossed to and fro by the waves, and carried about by every wind of doctrine, by human cunning by craftiness in deceitful scheme.

Jeremy Sweets  20:08
In one image of stability, you have that tree planted by the rivers of water. But this is more like chaff, isn't it? That is thrown about and tossed about by the wind, or like a small boat out at sea amongst a monstrous storm that is being tossed about and thrown about it is at the mercy of the storm that is there. Let me let me nuance this a little bit more as well. When I say unstable, I try to avoid this whole us versus them were good or bad kind of language. The instability that we see here may not always be readily apparent or seen specifically from the outside. There are many people in the world, that if you were to look at them, there seems to be a stability when it comes to finances or their job, maybe their connection with their family, there are some good and possible things. So I'm not saying that you can just step back and see someone in the world. They're unstable in terms of their thought and their dress and how they look and superficial things like that. But what I am saying is ultimately, when you get down to what life is about, there is a lack that is there. There is nothing ultimately that you can hang your hat upon that you can rest in security and sure Ignis in so this is not a look how bad they are and how good we are. I hope that's far from our minds. But this is a contrast of the ways that are available there are two paths, a broad path and a narrow path. There is a path that that is like chaff, there is a path that is like those that are planted by the rivers of water. And so I think this is an unstable way because that is what sin delivers. That is what sin provides. That is what sin gives it promises freedom, do what you want. But think back to Jill, teenager, was she free? Or was she overcome with the stress and the strain and the worry of lacking what was truly important in life, love, security provision, hope for the future. Unstable is what the freedom in the world provides. But on the flip side, I believe those that are in Christ, have a stability that cannot be removed and cannot be taken. There's no upturn in the economy or downturn in the economy that will be able to strip the stability of the Christian. There is no fire that would destroy a home or any other possession that could strip the stability of the Christian there is no health problem that could take away the stability of the Christian. And Hebrews chapter six, and verses 13 through 20. Hebrews chapter six verses 13 through 20.

Jeremy Sweets  23:26
Here says For when God made a promise to Abraham, since he had no one greater by whom to swear he swore by Himself saying, Surely I will bless you and multiply you. And thus Abraham having patiently waited, obtained the promise for people swear by something greater than themselves, and then all their disputes and oath is final for confirmation. So when God desired to show more convincingly to the heirs of the promise the unchangeable character of his purpose, he guaranteed it with an oath, so that by two unchangeable things in which it is impossible for God to lie, we who have fled for refuge might have strong encouragement to hold fast to the hope set before us. We have this as a sure and steadfast anchor of the soul, a hope that enters into the inner place behind the curtain where Jesus has gone as a forerunner on our behalf, having become a high priest forever after the order of Melchizedek. This passage underscores in no uncertain terms that when God promises a thing and is certain ensure he promised or took an oath on two important things here of his character of the fact that he will not law and he made this oath based upon himself and there is a certainty that it will not change. God is one that cannot lie. And when He promised us the thing, it is certain insurer, and with that certainty and surety, the text says that, that we might have strong incur was meant to hold fast to the hope set before us. Notice the language in verse 19. We have this as a sure and steadfast anchor of the soul. If you're in a boat, and you're going around in the sea talks about what do you do to provide some stability. In the midst of that storm, you put an anchor over that anchor comes down, the weight is great, and it sinks and lands into the bottom, and it provides a stability. As Christians, we have a stability in our faith in Christ. We have chosen to restrict our choices to what is good, and to base our faith on the one who will provide for us. And that I believe is true freedom, true freedom. In Romans chapter five, in verses one through five. Therefore since we have been justified by faith, we have peace with God through our Lord Jesus Christ. Through him we also have obtained access by faith into this grace in which we stand, and we rejoice in hope, of the glory of God. Not only that, but we rejoice in our sufferings, knowing that suffering produces endurance, and endurance produces character and character produces hope. And hope does not put us to shame because God's love has been poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit, who has been given to us. Notice the two things we rejoice in, first of all, all of our hope, we rejoice in our hope, because there is the stability there. So the stability here is found in our character, and what we have that is promised to us not in our circumstances, we can be steadfast in sure and have this confident hope, despite problems that we may face. In fact, if you step back, you see that freedom in the world promises pleasure, and it will give that but it's only only momentary, The Way of the Cross promises suffering. And it will give that, but it's only momentary. And we rejoice in our sufferings because we know it is temporary, and it leads to something that is even greater for us. Notice in Colossians, Chapter Three Colossians chapter three, turn your Bibles to Colossians chapter three, and notice verses 12 through 17.

Jeremy Sweets  27:44
Here's us put on then as God's chosen ones always and beloved, compassionate hearts, kindness, humility, meekness and patience, bearing with one another and if one has a complaint against another, forgiving each other as the Lord has forgiven you, so you also must forgive. And above all these put on love which binds everything together in perfect harmony. And let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts to which indeed you were called in one body and be thankful. Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly teaching and admonishing one another in all wisdom, singing songs, and hymns and spiritual songs with thankfulness in your hearts to God. And whatever you do in word or deed, do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through Him. Now, I wanted to read this passage, because this is one passage I find in scripture that I believe is a picture of stability, a picture of stability, a picture of true freedom, as you read through these opening things it says to put on and it tells us to put on a couple of things and it tells us to let a couple of things happen. Put on he says, compassionate hearts, kindness, humility, meekness, and patience. Let me ask you something who has more freedom, the person that lives with kindness, humility, meekness, patience, bearing with one another, forgiving another who has the ability in their life and freedom in their life, the one that has the strength of character, and the trust in God to be able to do that? Is it easy to forgive? Is it easy to do these things? It is a picture of true freedom, when we can choose the way of Christ, I think is a picture of instability and a complete lack of freedom. When you see the other descriptions like the works of the flesh or the or the, in James the warning against backbiting, devouring one another anger, resentment, all those things destroy. And so I'm talking about freedom really of our soul and our kids. character, the one here that can treat others with kindness, and forgive when wrong, has true freedom. The one that is ate up with selfishness is a slave to their sin and their selfish desires. And so we see, throughout Scripture, the way of Christ is really the true way of freedom. These are temporal things, but ultimately, ultimately these ways lead in different places as well. The Freedom in the World promises these momentary pleasures, and it can deliver that, but it really provides a true instability in the character and ultimately condemnation. Matthew 25 and verse 46. It paints these two ways with the first one, it says they will go away to eternal punishment. Second, Thessalonians, one nine, and uses the language ever lasting destruction. And not only that, but they will be shut out those that refuse God will be shut out from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of his mind. Condemnation is the result. In Matthew 25, verse 46, while some will go to eternal punishment, others will go to eternal life, those that have submitted themselves to God, First Peter, one, four, and five says that they have an inheritance that is imperishable, undefiled and unfading kept in heaven for you, who by God's power, being guarded through faith, for salvation ready to be revealed, in the last time, there are two kinds of freedom. And we need to make our choice are we going to serve ourselves? Are we going to serve God, I started off with another chart, and I decided to go about, use a different illustration. But maybe you can see this as way, a summary here,

Jeremy Sweets  31:57
when I'm talking about freedom in the world, there is a choice, and that is an unrestrained choice and a choice to do whatever it is you want. freedom in Christ is restrained than restricted. It is a serving of Christ, and the choice that is made. Both of these have a master don't think one serves self, and sin. And because a slave of that master, those that are find freedom in Christ, serve Christ, and submit themselves to him. There are external consequences of pleasure for those in the world. And if suffering in Christ were to stop there, many people would say, that's all there is. And I would rather have pleasure. But that's not the end of the picture isn't. There's also internal consequences, the character that we have in this law, even though we might have pleasures, there's a true instability that is found there, an instability of character, a lack of hope, a lack of something Sure, in certain, for those in Christ, they can suffer, and they can rejoice in that because they know that's not all there is. There is a stability in their character. I think about Daniel, are Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. As they approached the king, and they were asked to bow down, they could say with confidence to Him, we will not bow down to you. We will not bow down to you. If you put us in the pit of fire, we will still not bow down to you, God will deliver us and if not, we will not submit that that takes a strength of character and stability of character to be able to stand up and do what is right. Not only are there internal consequences, there's eternal consequences for those that are in the world it is condemnation or damnation. And for those found in Christ, it is salvation. I believe you can see from this, that there are two paths and two ways and a choice that you have to make. If you're here this morning, and you are a Christian, you have chosen away. But the key point there is that you must continue on that way. The commitment you made was not a single one day commitment, but a lifelong commitment. So serve Him with all of your power, my inability, and if you're not living as you should make correction, make change. If you're here this morning, and you see the instability that is found outside of Christ, if you have no hope and you're without God in this world and make a choice to serve Him. There will be strains struggles, sufferings, but it will all be worth it. It will immeasurably be worth it. To be able to have the stability and strength of characters we place our trust in God and hope for heaven. If there's any subject to the invitation, please come as we stand and sing at this time.
