It is always such a privilege and an honor to come together to worship God is good to be here today we get some rain outside and which we desperately need the grass and soil has been pretty dry but we have an opportunity to come together to worship God. And in spite of the changing times that we're dealing with, in this is the kind of the new normal, God is still God he's still the sovereign ruler of heaven and earth and we still worship Him and serve Him. And and and so as I've been thinking about a lesson for this morning, I've just remind myself that we need scripture is much of we've ever needed a scripture and the messages aren't always about the Coronavirus. God's bigger than the Coronavirus and he will outlast the Coronavirus. And so we just need truth from God's Word. So it's always great to come together whether it's in the yard assembly, or like we're doing this morning to worship God to sing songs to is Great and Holy Name appreciate the songs that John led for us this morning, as they will tie it with my lesson. And, and especially we have the opportunity to come together to remember Jesus the Greatest sacrifices, Jeremy said ever made on our behalf and to observe the Lord's Supper to have intimate, intimate communion with each other, and with our God in heaven is such a wonderful blessing. I hope that is this year progressive that you're doing some type of a Bible reading program. And I've been doing that none of us do it perfectly. But in my sunlight, Ben kind of using the same plan. But I want to share with you this morning. Some lessons that I have learned from Solomon. And and it's it's a stunning account. When you think about Solomon's early beginning He has such a great beginning, a wonderful father David wasn't perfect, but he was a man after God's own heart. But when we look at Solomon's life, and as I was reading through this, it's now been probably a month ago I've planted priestess at the heart writers yard assembly and we get kind of rained out. But when we look at Solomon's life, we see a man who was for much of his life was faithful to God. But in his own life he had the scripture says he his heart turned away from God. And I guess I'll say at the beginning, we don't know the final outcome of Solomon's life. The Book of Ecclesiastes gives a message of the conclusion is to fear God and to keep His commandments. Because this applies to all peoples I trust. That's how he ended his life. But the account in King so and part of this reading was first Kings chapter are really, really the first 11 chapters what we look at this morning is just a little selected verses from many of those chapters, that gives us a picture of Solomon's life. And again for much of his life, he was a great example of faith and leadership and love for God and love for his fellow man. But the the end of his life is quite troubling. Again, we're not here to make any judgments hope and pray that Solomon turned his life around after first Kings chapter 11. And even though people might speculate on Solomon's relationship with God at the very end, that's not the point. The point is, we need to serve God faithfully as long as our life last and learned some lessons from Solomon. So we'll be looking again, I have this all on the screen, feel free to look at these somebody's scriptures in your Bible if you want to.

Mike Roy  03:42
But I've titled was this lesson warnings from the life of Solomon. And the truth is, we learned lessons from each one of us from every Bible character, whether they were good or bad, strong or weak, we're all in the same boat to some degree. And we have our strengths, we have our weaknesses. But what I want to do is just look at some observations from the text. So the first six points, I'm going to make just observations from the text, much of which is very good about Solomon's life. And then, as we finished chapter, the few verses in chapter 11, I want to make some share some important lessons that we all need to glean from this story, this account this historical account of Solomon's life. And so what we're going to do and I'll put these upon on the screen, and look at his life and see what the text reveals, and then look at the struggle as you get into chapter 11. So again, much of what we find in the first section of First Kings is very good. So the first thing I want you to see is that David Solomon's father, gave him a solemn deathbed charge, not to forsake God but to be faithful to Him. First Kings chapter two verses one through four says When David's time to die drew near, he commanded Solomon his son saying, I am about to go the way of all the earth, be strong and show yourself a man, and keep the chart to the Lord your God, walking in his ways, and keeping his statutes, His commandments, his rules, and his testimonies, as it is written in the Law of Moses, that you may prosper and all that you do, and wherever you turn, that the Lord may establish his word that he spoke concerning the saying, if your sons pay close attention to their way to walk before me in faithfulness with all their heart, and with all their soul, you shall not lack a man on the throne of Israel. So we just begin by noticing that it on David's deathbed, he gave Psalm, I believe, a solemn but serious and end, warning that he needs to be a faithful man of God as long as his lifeless. So that's a very good thing. That's what we need to be doing. As parents, we teach and train our children. And as I get older, and we're all getting older, I say the same thing to my children, my sons in law, just continue to serve God faithfully. This is the most important thing in life a David on his deathbed, gives this message to Solomon. So surely Solomon realize the gravity of the importance with which he needed to serve God. So that's the first observation that we noticed. Secondly, you're going to want to see us that Solomon made a humble request for wisdom to judge God's people. This is in First Kings, chapter three verses 79. You might remember, in this chapter leading up to this particular request, God said to Solomon, ask anything that you want. Can you imagine what it'd be like for God to say, tell me what you want, give me your wish. That's what God said to Solomon. He could have asked for wealth and power and riches and success, and fame and fortune and the life of his enemies, which he did not. But that was what God offered Solomon. And Solomon is now the king of Israel. And this is what he said, and just going to pick up a few verses here. And now Oh, Lord, my God, you have made your servant king in the place of David, my father, although I am buddy, little child, I do not know how to go out or come in. And your servant is in the midst of your people, whom you have chosen a great people, to many to be numbered or counted from multitude, give you a servant, therefore an understanding mind to govern your people, that I may discern between the between good and evil for who was able to govern this great pete this year great people.

Mike Roy  07:46
What a remarkable request that Solomon makes, God says, asked me what you want. And it seems to be the sky is the limit, so to speak. Ask what you want Solomon, and this is what he said, What a humble man that and again, this shows us and demonstrates his great humility and his devotion to God. Solomon was a man with a very, very good beginning. And he showed tremendous humility, and wisdom at this point, asking for understanding and judging God's people. And of course, the account goes on to describe the the two women basically find the standard two prostitutes come to the Solomon, one woman's slept on her newborn baby and killed the baby, the other one. And so would they like the one who lost a child said, Hey, that's my child. And the other one said, no, no, the one that's dead is yours. So so that's when Solomon said, Bring me a sword. And I'll cut the child in two. And then each of you will have half a child. And the woman who, whose son was still living said, no, no, no, my lord, you give her the baby, I want the baby to live. And then Solomon costs reveal the truth that the woman who said cut the child in two was not really the mother of that child. And so that was beginning of his fame. It went far and wide. And again, the point I simply make here is that when God gave Solomon this invitation to ask him anything he wanted, what would you ask for? What would I asked for? He asked for wisdom. So great, great attitude on Solomon's part. Thirdly, as we continue to look at the summit, some observations from the text. So not only did Solon ask for wisdom, but God gave Solomon greater wisdom and knowledge than perhaps anyone on Earth, any living human being. So in First Kings, chapter four, verses 29 to 34. It says that God gave Solomon wisdom and understanding beyond measure. He was a very, very wise man. He gave him wisdom and understand beyond measure and breath of mine like the sand of the seashore, so that Solomon's wisdom surpassed wisdom of the people the east and all the wisdom of Egypt, for he was wiser than all other men. Sounds like the smartest man on earth, the wisest man on earth with a godly perspective. Why is it then Ethan the s rawhide and HeMan and Cal call and darda the sons of Mayhall. And his fame was in all the surrounding nations. He also spoke 3000 Proverbs, in His songs were 1005, he spoke of trees from the seed of that is in Lebanon, to the hyssop that grows out of the wall. He spoke also a beast in a birds, and reptiles and a fish. And people of all nations came to hear the wisdom of Solomon, from all the kings of the earth who had heard of his wisdom. So the point I'm simply making is, of course, Solomon, to his credit, asked for wisdom and judgment and giving him an understanding heart, and God gave it to him to the point that Solomon is described as the wisest person in the world and had a godly perspective. So those are things in his favor in terms of serving God, as you continue to read this before we go to this, let me just mention briefly

Mike Roy  11:19
that So chapter five, so I'm just gonna make this brief reference here. Solomon formed an alliance with Hiram king of Tyra to gain help and billing to tempt the Lord. So Psalm and one of his great goals was to build a temple house of worship for God he contracted with, with the Hiram to do that. And you have to find chapter six, Solomon builds, we don't have time to go into a magnificent temple, a magnificent, breathtaking house of worship. That's what he was doing was leading God's people in worship, who was magnificent can't even begin to describe the magnitude of that in chapter that took seven years, seven years to build the temple of the Lord. And then in chapter seven, he built his own palace, his own royal house, took him 13 years to build that house again, it was over the top to say the least. And for those of y'all who are building houses, just keep in mind if you if it's a slow process, this thing about Solomon that was 13 years, so took him 20 years, to build his house and the Lord's at the temple of the Lord. So we get into chapter eight. And the picture we see here that Solomon now brings the ark of the Lord into the temple, and he led the people in worship. So again, what we see in Solomon, a great example in so many ways, and he closes chapter eight is a long chapter, much information in there. As you get to the end of the chapter. He offered 142,000 animals, lambs,

Mike Roy  12:58
and another type of sacrifice on the earth 142,000 animal sacrifices and but when you look at this text, you're just gonna read a few things over here. It says in verse 54, when Solomon had finished all these prayers and supplications to the Lord, He rose from before the altar of the Lord where he had been kneeling, where he had been kneeling with his hand spread out toward heaven. He stood in blessed the whole assembly of Israel in a loud voice saying, Praise beat to the Lord was given rest His people Israel, justice, he promised, not one word has failed of all the good promises he gave to His servant Moses, may the Lord our God be with us as He was with our ancestors? May He never leave us nor forsake us. May he turn our hearts to Him to walk in obedience to Him and keep His commands or keep the commands decrees and laws. He gave our ancestors and made these words of mine which I have prayed before the Lord, be near to the Lord our God day and night that he may uphold the cause of his servant, and the cause of his people Israel, according to each day's needs, so that all the peoples of the earth may know that the Lord is God, and that there is no other and may your hearts be fully committed to the Lord our God, to live by his decrees and his commitment, obey His commands, as at this time, wow, what a spiritual leader. Solomon was a worship leader. He was a preacher of God. I'm not he was a preacher of God, he wrote the word of God, he spoke the word of God. And in this account, he is pleading with the people of Israel to worship God faithfully, and that they would never leave God in any capacity. So again, as you look at Solomon and his in his, especially his beginning and his growth and development as a king, as a leader, we do say see a strong spiritual focus and this man is doing what he needs to be doing and leading the people of Israel to faithfully serve God. Did you continue to look at some observations I picked out six there, probably more than we could look at. But the fifth observation from the text I want us to see is that the Lord appeared a second time to Solomon, and personally warned him not to turn away from Him. So in First Kings chapter nine, and verses one through nine, we'll just look at this account here. It said, when Solomon had finished building the temple of the Lord, and the royal palace, and had achieved all he desired to do, the Lord appeared to him a second time, as he appeared to him at Gibbon, And the Lord said to him, I have heard the prayer and plea you have made before me, I have consecrated this temple, which you have built by putting my Name there forever, my eyes and my heart will always be there. As for you, if you walked before me faithfully with integrity of heart, and uprightness, as David your father did, and do all I command and observe my observe my decrees and laws, I will establish your royal throne over Israel forever. As I promised David your father, when I said, You shall never fail to have a successor on the throne of Israel, the universe six but if you are your descendants turn away from me. And do not observe the commands and decrees I have given you, and go off to serve other gods and worship them, then I will cut off Israel from the land I have given them and we will reject this temple, I have consecrated from my name, Israel will then become a byword and an object of ridicule among all peoples, this temple will become a heap of rubble, all who passed by will be appalled and will scoff or hiss and say, Why has the Lord done such a thing to this land and to this temple? People will answer, because they have forsaken the LORD their God, who brought their ancestors out of Egypt, and have embraced other gods worshipping them as and serving them. That is why the Lord brought all this disaster on them. So again, as you look at this, this text here in First Kings, chapter chapters two down to chapter 11, we see that Solomon had every advantage, and every motivation to serve God faithfully all the days of his life. So God didn't appear to him just once, but twice he appeared to him. And now again, God gives a solemn warning himself to Solomon, not to turn away. So shockingly, become the chapter six, I'm sorry, chapter 11.

Mike Roy  17:59
And we see that Solomon deliberately turned away from following the Lord. So let's look at first Kings chapter 11, verses one through 10. Again, as I think about my responsibility in preaching, or any of us who preach God's word, we want to be balanced in our preaching and focus on the course the grace of God, the mercy of God, which is infinite. We want to look at the the success successes in the lives of God's people, as well as the failures. But first Kings chapter 11, is such a shocking text to me. And I don't know how it is to you, but it's there for a reason. And God wants us to serve him faithfully all the days of our life. So notice, in the text over here, after all the good things that really characterize Solomon's life, it says in verse 11, now, King Solomon, however, love many foreign women besides Pharaoh's daughter Moabites Ammonites, Edomites, side donations in Hittites, they were from nations about where the Lord had told the Israelites, you must not intermarry with them, because they will surely turn your heart after their gods. Nevertheless, Solomon held fast to them in love, he clung to them in love. He was completely infatuated with them, says he has 700 wives of royal birth, and 300 concubines and his wives led him astray. As Solomon grew old his wives turned his heart after other gods, and his heart was not fully devoted to the Lord his God, as the heart of David his father had been, it says he went after who he are, he followed Ashtoreth, the goddess of the Sidonians and Molek that this testable god of the Ammonites in verse six says that Solomon did evil in the eyes of the Lord. He did not follow the Lord completely, completely. As David his father had done just several things to notice in there. So God has specifically warned his people not to intermarry with the Canaanite nations. Solomon, completely ignored that. And this may have been started earlier in his life. And he married all these foreign women from these Gentile pagan nations, who were totally in the grip of idolatry. So God clearly told him not to do it, he did it anyway. And says that he held fast to them in love. Solomon had 700 wives of royal birth, and 300 concubines. Some people speculate that the some of these were political alliances, whether it was from the the, the Egyptians, and I don't know all of that. But what I see a picture of is Solomon, is totally given to these foreign women. How do you How does a person have 1000 wives, and again, say and reading commentary, some will say, well, that's that that's maybe not accurate, or it was a textual variation in the look of a Song of Solomon mentions about 60 women that were he was really close to. But in the end, when it was all said, and done, Solomon, had 1000 wives. And it says that his wives turned his heart away from God, and that that he followed after asterisk, the goddess of the side, Donnie, he followed after Molek, the detestable god of the MS, it wasn't just his wives influencing him, he got involved in their worship, and went to their shrines is stunning. It was just stunning to me to think of the man of this spiritual background, doing this. So in verse seven, on the hill, east of Jerusalem, Solomon built the high place for Chemosh, the detestable god of Moab. So Solomon built this time, energy, money, and built this place of worship for an idol God, and from Olek, the detestable god of the Ammonites, and he did the same for all his foreign wives, who burned incense and offered sacrifices to their gods. It's just remarkable to me. And then in verse nine and 10, the Lord became angry with Solomon because his heart had turned away from the Lord, the God of Israel, who had appeared to him twice, although who, although he had forbidden Solomon to follow other gods, Solomon did not keep the Lord's command. And again, we're not here to make any judgments on Solomon.

Mike Roy  22:46
In the book of Ecclesiastes, certainly in the case that the end of life should be serving God faithfully. But it paints a very serious and grim picture of a man who had a remarkably good beginning. But in the end of his life, that the scripture says over and over again, that his wives turned his heart away from the Lord, to these foreign gods now, maybe make a few of observations before we wrap up the lesson. Excuse me, just a couple of differences between David and Solomon, I just thought we would share. So David sinned very badly on several occasions, but he never turned his heart away from God. So I think we need to say that David certainly had a sense, I've got my sins, and you've got your sins, we all have to deal with sin. Dave has sinned quite badly on a number of occasions. But that is one of the differences. David's heart never turned away from God. In fact, Paul says, think in the book of Acts, that he described David as a man after God's own heart Acts, chapter 13, verse 20, so and that's what's encouraging scripture. There's forgiveness is grace for all of us for every sin, every struggle, all of our failures, we can overcome all that. But we just don't want to persistence in and make that our lifestyle. So David, in spite of all of this sin and struggle, he was a man after God's own heart. When he was confronted with his sin, He humbled Himself, He turned to God to do His will. On the other hand, Solomon sinned greatly Excuse me. But the scripture says that he turns his heart away from God, and to idolatry. So again, I think one of the lessons need to learn is so important for us to be involved in some type of ongoing Bible reading, program process, whether it's just a part of the Bible, the whole Bible, we need to see all of God's word to get a proper understanding of who he is, what he expects from us, and when in doing that is I've been a Christian now for a long time and about 40 yours. And every time I read these accounts, it just kind of wakes me up again. And so I think that's happened with me in Solomon. So I wanted to just these are just my observations, five important lessons that I gleaned from this text for really from chapter to chapter 11. The first point is, if it happened to Solomon, it can happen to us. That is, if Solomon could fall away from God, if he can turn away from God, we hope at some point he turned back to God. But But looking at this context over here, the point I'm making here, if Solomon, whom the Lord had appeared to him twice, if he could stumble and turn his heart away from God, I can too. And you can, too. And that's why I preached with such conviction, and with such love, because I know the seriousness of this. That's what I think that the message is, is kind of screaming to me from this section is, if this happened to Solomon,

Mike Roy  26:00
camp and anybody, and nobody is above sin, nobody's above temptation. Nobody, none of us were above falling or stumbling. None of us were above, going back into the world, it happens. How many times do you hear of Christians leaving the Lord's church, leaving their spouse and going to live with a girlfriend or a boyfriend, or marry somebody else that they don't have the right to do that? So the point is that we've got to be careful, Paul, the apostle warns us Apollyon First Corinthians chapter 10, verse 12, let him who thinks he stands, take heed lest he fall. Secondly, I would say another lesson from this text over here is that we need to choose you choose your marriage partner wisely. So don't make that decision based on lust or pride or power or ego or selfishness. Choose someone who's going to help you get to heaven. Choose someone that you respect you someone that you look up to spiritually. I'm so thankful I chose a woman who fears God. I'm so thankful that my sons in law, fear God. And so we can't again, overemphasize this and this is one of the messages from this text over here. Choose your marriage partner very wisely. Choose, you have to be able to look up to someone that you're going to spend your life with, if you can't look up to them. How in the world, you're going to have maintained a spiritual focus. Think about the women Uppsala and married and chose these women, Moabites and Ammonites, they were, I don't worshippers. They're not worshiping God. And the text indicates that they their hearts did turn away from God. So one of the lessons that all of us need to learn, especially our young people, be wise in choosing a marriage partner to someone who seeks first God's kingdom and his righteousness and everything that they do want to say thirdly, that disobedience carries dire consequences. Think about the grief, the anguish, the guilt that Solomon experienced the Lord's anger coming against him, God tore the kingdom away from Solomon, again, did he lose his soul? I don't know. But but this whole obedience to God's Word does carry dire consequences. Fourthly, I want to suggest that greater privilege brings greater responsibility and judgment. So when we think about Solomon, it's like, not like he didn't know about idols. He didn't know about intermarrying. With Gentile women, he knew all about that. And he was one who knew the law and shared that with his people. In God, again, the Lord appeared to him twice, the Lord appeared to him twice. And so it reminds us that if we have greater risk, greater privilege, and by knowing God's Word in great greater connection to His Word, then we have a greater responsibility to stay the course, and to serve God faithfully to the end of our lives. One other point that before we extend the invitation song, is that we need to serve God faithfully to the very end of our lives. You don't, and I want to stress that we don't. We're not talking about being perfect. None of us are perfect. None of us are sinless. We all need God's grace. I need God's grace as much as anybody needs God's grace. But we want to serve God's faithfully to the end of our lives. Why spend so much time serving God? And then as we get to the end of our lives, make terrible decisions, and go back into the world and give up on God and give up on his church. We're not perfect. I'm not perfect. No one here is perfect and Broadmoor, but but we can't use that as an excuse to say, Well, I'm just not going to go to church anymore. I'm going to give up my faith in God because there are imperfect people in God's church. So again, we need to serve God faithfully at the end of our lives. So the question I think, for all of us this morning, as we prepare to sing the invitation song is will we learn important lessons from Solomon's life did he Teaching us all the things that we've talked about. Again, the overarching message to me is that of Solomon who has such a great beginning, an incredible father and surrounded himself with good people had a strong spiritual focus. If he could turn his heart from God, we had better be careful that we don't let the same thing happen to you here this morning. You need prayer for your struggles, we all have them. I think it's so helpful for us to be transparent in our teaching and preaching, by saying that we all have struggles we all have difficulties, excuse me moments of doubt. But we're here, as we say, to pray with you for you to help each other to reach out to one another as we serve God, but mainly to be committed as the song that we're about to sing tells us to do if there's any way that we can assist you. At this time, you might come always sing this invitation song
