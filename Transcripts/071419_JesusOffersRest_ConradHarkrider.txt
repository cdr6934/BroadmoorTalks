It's good to see each and every one of you here this morning, what a blessing it is to be able to come and worship God together as a group and a body of believers in Jesus Christ. If you have your Bibles and want to be turning to Matthew, the 11th chapter, Matthew chapter 11.

My family and I have just recently returned from a long summer trip, we went down to Texas to see friends and family for the Fourth of July, and we did a lot of driving. And we went to Shreveport, Louisiana, down to Houston, Texas, then up to college station and through Nacogdoches, then back to Nashville. And it seems like when you're coming home, the drive is always longer. I don't know if that's because you're ready to be in your own bed or you're just, you're tired and done with traveling. But on the way back, we were driving at night, it was dark, the kids had fallen asleep, and have you if you've ever had that feeling of trying to keep yourself awake. It's almost like the that drowsy feeling can be overwhelming. And they say that driving while tired can be as dangerous as driving while intoxicated. It's it's that strong. And my wife usually usually tries to stay awake and help with that. But sometimes we'll have these conversations in the car. And I asked her this kind of off the wall question I said, What is more satisfying to you sleeping when you are tired? Or eating when you are hungry? When you're really hungry? And if you ask that question to people, it's kind of funny their responses. Some people say it you don't want to be around me when I'm tired. I mean, I have to have my my beauty sleep, right? And then some people are like, Oh, no, I can go without sleep. But when I don't have food, then I'm a different person. Right? I love my wife's answer. She said, If Would you rather be hungry or tired? She said, can I just have both? Do I really have to choose between those.

Jesus when he was teaching, he often used parables, illustrations and examples from everyday life. And many times he he would use the image that related to these basic everyday needs that we have. In Matthew chapter five, he talks about hungering and thirsting after righteousness. In John chapter four, he tells the woman at the well that she can come to Him and He will provide this water he will quench the deepest thirst within her soul. And here in Matthew chapter 11, Jesus extends an invitation to the multitudes to the people who are listening to him. And he compares it to something that all of us need on a daily basis, and that is rest. Jesus offers rest true rest for our souls. Read with me and Matthew chapter 11, beginning of verse 25. It says, At that time, Jesus answered and said, I thank You, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that you have hidden these things from the wise and prudent, and have revealed them to babes. Even So Father, for so it seemed good in your sight. All things have been delivered to me by my father, and no one knows the Son except the Father, nor does anyone know the Father except the Son, and the one to whom the Son wills to reveal him. Come to me, all who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you and learn from me, for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. For my yoke is easy, and my burden is light. Matthew chapter 11, comes in the context of Jesus sending the disciples out in Matthew chapter 10, he calls the 12 apostles to himself, and he sends them out. And he gives them a warning, he says that your message, your efforts are, are going to be met with resistance. You remember what he told them? He says, Don't fear those who kill the body, but rather fear the one who can kill both body and so but the point of that was to say that there are going to be people who are trying to persecute you, who resist this message. In chapter 11 And verse 22. Jesus rebuked the cities where most of his miracles had been done. Khorasan Bethsaida Copernican, because after seeing all of these wonderful things, it says that they were unwilling to repent, they weren't willing to change. They refused what Jesus had brought to them. And so it's important to see that this section of Jesus offering this invitation of reaching out to all people comes in the context of a rejection of people saying they were not interested in what he had to offer. And instead of trying to change the message, or rebrand the gospel, or come up with a different approach, Jesus instead shows us the type of individuals that he was calling to Himself. Jesus shows us what kind of people he was drawing to himself. Those He is inviting to partake in his rest. Notice with me in verse 25, in verse 25, it says, At that time, Jesus answered and said, I thank You, Father, Lord of heaven, and earth. You know, of all the prayers that Jesus said, while he was here on Earth, we don't have very many of them recorded only a few. The most notable prayer that Jesus offered comes from the Sermon on the Mount Matthew six what we refer to as the Lord's Prayer, our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name, your kingdom come your will be done when he was teaching his disciples to pray. But the second recorded prayer in Matthew's Gospel comes here in chapter 11. And did you notice what what it is that Jesus is praying for here? In this verse, he says that he thanks the Father for hiding these things from the wise and the prudent from those who were well educated from those who had their credentials that had the letters after their name, that seems that seems backwards, because in the business world, those are the people that we want to come to us that we want to be around us. We want the people who have a degree that have the training that have the background and the education who are smart, and intelligent. But it's different in the Lord's Kingdom, those, those things can actually be a hindrance to us. Education, and power and status often lead people further and further away from God. That promotion might bring more money. But it can also drive a wedge between us and our relationship with the Father. Jesus says that God's will, was to reveal and show these things to who, to babies, to little children, to those who are the least of all. In verse 27, Jesus affirms his authority. He says in verse 27, all things have been delivered to me by my father, and no one knows the Son except the Father. The Father has given Jesus he has entrusted him with all authority. It reminds us of Matthew 28. In the Great Commission, when Jesus was about to send his disciples into all the world, he said, All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth. The gospel of Jesus is valid. His invitation to all men is meaningful, because of his position because of what God has entrusted, and placed within his care. He goes on to say that no one knows the sun except the Father. And no one knows the Father except the Son. This is a way of saying that Jesus is no ordinary man. Jesus was not just simply a prophet, he had a special and unique relationship with the Father. He knew God perfectly and completely. And he alone was in a position to communicate God's will to the world, to tell men, how they can be pleasing and acceptable to God. And that's why the only person only the only way that a person can come to know God can have a relationship, a connection with God is through Jesus Christ. He had that perfect union with the Lord. And now his desire is to share that to allow others to come into relationship with the Father.

The blessings that He offers to those who are willing to come is rest. Jesus offers rest. Look at verse 28, verse 28, says Come to me all who labor and are heavy laden and I will give you rest. First of all, notice that Jesus offers rest to those who verse 28, are willing to come. The gospel has and always will be an invitation, inviting people to come, inviting people to receive what the Lord has offered. When Jessica and I were in college we lived on, we went to the same school, we lived on different sides of the campus went to a really big school in Texas. And her dorm was on the south side of the campus. Mine was on the north side of the campus, I was in the 1940s dorms, and she was in the newer section. But if we wanted to see each other, it was about a 15 minute walk. And I remember having those conversations on the phone those negotiations, saying things like, well, if if you walk over here, then I'll let you pick where we eat dinner. Or she would say yeah, but if you come over here, then I'll pay for dessert. And sometimes we would meet in the middle. And sometimes we wouldn't meet at all because we were too tired. But in order for that to happen, someone had to be willing to make the effort. Someone had to step out and take the initiative. Jesus has extended this amazing invitation. He's calling all people to Himself, but his rest and blessings will only be shared with those who are willing to come. In his day. Jesus did not fit the expectations of the people. He wasn't a conquering Messiah, they wanted a warrior and a king they wanted someone who would support and congratulate or approve of the current religious establishment. But that's not what Jesus came to do. This point is made here in chapter 11. Of Look, Look back at verse 17. Jesus tells this, this poem or this, this saying of the day, he says, we played the flute for you and you did not dance, we mourn to you and you did not lament. The point that he's making is that Jesus did not fit the mold. He didn't fit the expectations of the people. He gives the example of John the Baptists. He says John the Baptist came and he was living out in the wilderness. He was dressed in camels hair, he ate bugs, he was kind of a wild man out there by himself. And you know what the, the Pharisees the teacher said about him, he he has a demon, he's possessed. Well, Jesus came and he didn't live off in a reclusive life. He was in this in the part of the society, he went to their weddings, he met with people, he talked with them, he sat with them, he joined into their lives. And you know what they said about him. He's a glutton and a drunkard. So no matter what God sent to the people, it didn't fit their expectations. It didn't fit into what they were wanting. And people often do the same thing. Today, we do the same thing. today. We want God to fit into our, our wishes, our desires, our ideals. We want God to meet us on our terms. We say I'll come to, I'll come to Jesus, if it fits into my life. If it works for my schedule, if it benefits me in some way, I'll come to Jesus, if I am able to get this job. If I if this relationship will work out, then I'll come to Jesus, I'll come to Jesus if he lets me think and act and live the way that the way that I want. That's not that's not coming to Jesus. That's asking Jesus to come and serve us. Jesus is looking for people who put themselves to the side who are willing to deny their own desires and wishes.

Conrad Harkrider  14:19
We cannot say that we are coming to Jesus and still put our own thoughts and opinions as first place in our life. It requires a willingness to change, to bend to submit ourselves to His will. In Matthew chapter seven, in verse 21, Jesus said, Not everyone who says to Me, Lord, Lord, will enter the kingdom of heaven, but the one who does the will of my Father, Who is in heaven. Coming to Jesus is about submitting our will to his it's more than just pronouncing faith or saying that we believe in him. And it's a total change of life. Notice where we are coming to where is Jesus inviting people, he says, come to where come to me. The invitation has not come to a particular church, come to this doctrine, come to this set of beliefs come to worship in a certain way. Those things have a place, our doctrine, our beliefs, those are important. But that's not what draws people to the Lord. We need to invite people to come to Jesus, not come to this great group of people not come to this preacher, not come to this location. But teaching people about the Lord, make disciples of all men, so that they can come and have a relationship with Christ. When we get that right. The other things fall into place. People will live godly, they will worship correctly, they will submit their lives to the Lord when they come to Jesus. First, notice who the call is being made to, he says, all who labor and are heavy laden, Jesus offers rest. Second of all, to those who carry heavy burdens, those who are carrying heavy burdens. The invitation is extended to everyone who meets this description. He says come to me all who are weary and heavy laden, the gospel is not limited to those who live in a particular part of town. It's not exclusive to those who live in the United States of America. It's not only directed towards those on the north side of the south side, or those with money, or those who have education or those who are of a certain race or background. The gospel is intended for all people. But notice there is a qualification here. Jesus is calling people who are weary and burdened. Isn't that interesting? Jesus is calling those who are tired, and weighed down. My brother was telling me recently about his son's flag football team. He's going to be coaching this next year. And he's talking about the types of players that he's looking for, I guess, in their league, you can do some recruiting, and you can try to get certain kids to be on your team. And so he was mentioning some of the qualities you want kids who are quick, who are agile, who are fast, who have a good attitude. Can you imagine if there was a coach that said, Give me all the kids who are slow? Give me all the kids who are uncoordinated. Give me all the kids who can't run 10 yards without getting tired? That doesn't make any sense. That's not a team that you would want to be on. Why would Jesus want these types of people who are carrying burdens who are weighed down to come to Him? Are these the type of people who have so much baggage and issues to sort out and work through? In Matthew chapter nine? In verse 10, it says, as Jesus reclined at table in the house, behold, many tax collectors and sinners came and were reclining with Jesus and his disciples. And when the Pharisees saw this, they said to his disciples, Why does your teacher eat with tax collectors and sinners? But when he heard it, he said, those who are well have no need of a physician. But those who are sick. Jesus was willing to sit down with the outcasts of the Jewish society, the tax collectors and the sinners, because those were the ones who were in the greatest need of the gospel.

Conrad Harkrider  19:13
Notice Jesus does not condone or support people who are living sinful lifestyles, but he didn't disregard them or avoid them completely. Instead, he knew they were the ones who needed to draw near those were the ones who are weary and heavy laden. This is not talking about those who are weary those who are tired those who are laboring, it's not referring to people who are physically weary. They have a bad back or they suffer from some physical problem or illness, but this is referring to spiritual sickness. And those people can come to the great physician to receive healing for their greatest problems. Do you Jesus says come, and He will lift and carry those burdens. You know, we live in a culture today in a time where there's so much wealth and affluence. We have good jobs. We have houses, we have grocery stores that are stocked full of food, we can drive through the the fast food place and get food at any time. During the day. Our two to three cars are parked out in front of our permanent homes and with so many possessions, and conveniences, it's easy to stop feeling the need for God. We feel like we don't need him we have everything that we would ever want. We are sufficient. We rely on our own strength and wisdom. Jesus provides rest to those who see their need, who realize that they are carrying a burden, that there is this thing that they cannot do on their own. They recognize that although sin may have its pleasures, its benefits. It's a lore for a period of time. Ultimately, that's a path that's empty. It leads down to the way of destruction. As Revelation chapter three and verse 17 says, without the Lord we are wretched, pitiable, poor, blind, and naked. When we come to Jesus, we need to see him as the one who offers the cure is the only remedy to our souls burdens. And it requires humility to acknowledge that it wasn't until naman put away his pride and was willing to listen to those around him that he came and was released from his disease. Jesus offers restoration to those who carry great burdens. Also notice verse 29. He says, Take my yoke upon you and learn from me for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. Jesus offers rest to those who desire to learn. Those who desire to learn, he says Take my yoke upon you. A yoke is a wooden frame that is laid upon the Ox. And it's used in plowing it allows them to breathe, to be productive, to channel their strength and their energy and effort. But it also causes them to submit. They are yielding to the direction and authority of another. Coming to Jesus is not solely about being released from sin and having our burdens taken away. But it also means placing our lives under his will and authority submitting ourselves to His guidance and direction. We're not submitting to one. Here he says I am gentle and lowly. We don't submit to one who is arrogant, who is selfish, who has his own interests at heart, we are putting our we are entrusting our lives in one who has our best interests in mind. This is the character of Jesus. Also notice verse 30. He says My yoke is easy, and my burden is light. Jesus is not out to destroy us to force us into a life of misery and hardship. That's how Satan operates. Satan is the taskmaster who wants to place things on us that rule over us that control us that dominate our lives. That's what sin does, it consumes us. But Jesus, on the other hand, says that his way, is a way of peace. He lives our burdens. He takes care of us and provides life. He keeps us from being consumed by greed or lust or jealousy, or anger and his way ultimately leads to satisfaction and true fulfillment.

Conrad Harkrider  24:03
Notice that when we submit to Him, this is coupled with a desire to learn from him. We want to learn from Jesus he has something to teach us. It's not just a mental exercise of Where was Jesus born? How long did he live facts about his life. But instead when you think about learning from Jesus think about becoming a disciple seeking to be like the teacher a couple of weeks ago, I was working at my desk in the house and the girls came in and they they decided that they wanted to work too. So they set up their chairs right behind my chair, and they got a little stand. And then they went and got their computers which are equipped with these little songs and this high pitched voice that sings through the alphabet. And after about five minutes I said you guys need to find somewhere else to work. This is not, this is not productive here. But children are constantly watching their parents. They see what they do. They want to imitate them. They want to be liked them, they want to be where they are. They want to talk and act and think in the same way. And so it is with us when we come to Jesus, it's more than just attending a service. It's more than listening to preaching. It involves a total change of life where we want to follow His ways to follow his path to have the same heart and concern that Jesus has. And so let me ask you, Jesus had concern for those who were lost have we learned that same concern? Jesus stood for what was right, even when it was unpopular, have we learned to have that same courage. Jesus was willing to submit himself to others to help others for their benefit, have we learned to have that same type of giving attitude. Jesus invites all to come to him. But that requires us to learn to follow to live in the same way. And finally, Jesus offers risks to those who seek rest for their souls. At the end of the day, all of us desire this rest. God has placed it in our hearts, we try to find a small portion of it in this life. We get away for a vacation, we go somewhere we try to unplug for a couple of days. But as you know, when you come back, the emails are piling up. The laundry is overflowing. everyone's schedules are out of whack. And it's like, why did we ever go on vacation, it's so much harder to come back. No matter where we we search in this life, there is no lasting, ongoing, sustaining rest. This world is temporary. And so if we seek for it in vacations or possessions, or money, or whatever else, it ultimately leaves us feeling empty, and unfulfilled. But what Jesus is offering is something that is far greater than anything we could find in this life. Something that is eternal, that is complete. It is 100% relieves us from this burden. In Matthew chapter 13, in verse 34, Jesus says that the kingdom of heaven is like a treasure hidden in a field, which a man a man found, and he goes, and he sells everything that he has in order to buy that field. That's the rest that Jesus is offering. It's worth more than anything that we have in this life. It's worth more than that car, that phone, that bank account, that new job, that new house, whatever it is, we may have our eyes on what Jesus offers is far greater. And so what burden are you carrying around? What weight do you have on your shoulders that you're continuing to haul with you through this life? Bring it to Jesus, come to Jesus and find the rest and the fulfillment and the relief that only he can offer? Then the King will say to those on his right hand, come you bless of my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world. Are you in need of God's rest? And the grace that off is offered through Jesus Christ.

Conrad Harkrider  28:45
