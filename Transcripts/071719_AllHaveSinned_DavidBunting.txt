It's good to be with you tonight. Appreciate very much the invitation to come and be part of this series. It's always a delight to be here with you. It's an encouragement to see this work thriving and growing the kingdom prospering in this city, and you being a bright light to those that are lost.

David Bunting  00:21
Let you know how I'm actually related to Andy is actually we're cousins. But he calls me uncle. Yeah, but I'm not as uncle. I'm actually his cousin. But we taught that generation referred to as older cousins in that manner. So there's a number of us as you know, as our family grows, unquestionably, sin is in the world. Evil is in this world. Both believers and unbelievers alike agree that there is behavior that is acceptable, as well as there is behavior and conduct that is unacceptable. And such behavior that some of that is even deserving of punishment. Now, although the majority of people in this world will justify much, if not most of their bad conduct, sin does exist. There is such a thing as sin. And Paul addressed that subject quite clearly in his writings, as he tried to convict the loss of their sin and of their need of Jesus Christ. And until we see ourselves are truly lost in sin, why do we need a savior? Here? Why should I believe in Jesus Christ? So this evening, we'll talk about some of that tonight, as we look at some of the things relating to the subject. There is such a thing as sinful action and there is sinful words and there are sinful thoughts. But how does a person become a sinner? Well, there are some doctrines that exist today among men that teach that from the moment of birth, the person is inherently evil, because they are defiled in their body as well as defined in the soul with a corrupted nature, a nature which has been passed down to us from Adam, so all you might manatee is centered because of Adam. Well, does the Bible say? Is that what it teaches? Not Catholicism, as well as Calvinism spread error on this subject. And they are deceiving multitude upon multitudes of men about their sin. But did God's prophets did God's apostles teach that every living person is a sinner? Because they inherited it, from their parents and from the great grandparents and their great, great, great, great, great grandparents? Is that how we are sinners because we have this supposedly completely depraved nature? Well, I'm going to answer the question, Well, no, that's not what the Bible teaches. But what does the Bible teach about sin? Well, let's look at some passages. And we're gonna look at very familiar passages. There's nothing to be anything new tonight. Nothing amazingly revealing that I have to say, but we just need to be reminded of what sin is, and how we get that sin and what we need to do about that sin. The Bible teaches that everyone who practices sin also practices lawlessness, and sin is lawlessness. When I just very quickly emphasize that word, practice, sin is a practice is not simply a nature that you have within you. Sin is a practice a matter which a person is engaged in is something that a person is doing. It's something that the person is involved in, it may be Is he using his body you may be using his lips, and he may be using his thoughts. But sin is a practice. And we can see in all the ways but it is a practice. And the apostle John is very clear, saying everyone who practices in also practices lawlessness are words that

David Bunting  04:52
lawlessness very simply is the is to act or to live outside of law is based Do something that the law does not give us permission to do to do something that is contrary to law. It is to live a life that is not regulated or live or live as if you are not regulated by law, and therefore you're not conforming to the law. So sin is a practice of lawlessness. It is also defined by John the Apostle, that sin is unrighteousness. All sin is unrighteousness. In all unrighteousness, he said, and the reason why is because all injustice is of every guy, not just an injustice against another person, but all injustice is things that are outside of God's will, outside of righteousness, opposes God's will. And so any act, any word, any thought, that opposes God, it poses HIS WILL a pope opposes His purpose. God says that is sin. And man needs to know that we all need to know that we need to teach our kids about sin, we need to teach ourselves about sin, and we need to teach the world about sin. Now, if there is no law, there, well that means there is no transgression of law. And if there's no transgression of law, well, then there is no sin. And Paul uses that argument. In Romans chapter five, verse 13. We're there in verse 12. It reads, therefore, just as through one man, sin entered into the world, Adam was the and he were the first sinners. And so they committed the first sin on Earth. But we didn't hear it their sin. You did that on your own, and so did I, but sin into the world through one man and as a result of that sin, there is death, we all suffer physical death. And by our own sin, we will suffer spiritual death if we don't save ourselves with a working faith in Jesus Christ. And he says, so death spread to all men, because all sin, everybody sin. For until the law, sin was in the world, and but sin is not imputed there when there is no law. It goes on to say, nevertheless, death reigned from Adam unto Moses, even over those who had not seen in the likeness of the fence. And so even if you haven't committed the same sin, and Adams committed, you're still a sinner when you transgress law, because there are sin. what that implies is, there is law. There has been lost since the beginning of time, Adam had law, Abraham had law. The Israelites had law, the Gentiles have law, and we have law. And sin is a practice of lawlessness of injustice, that violates God's Will Adam sinned, why? Why was Adam A sinner because he violated violated what his creator commanded him. Genesis to Genesis three. That's why he was a sinner. He committed that which was against God's law. Now, Adams, physical genetic code has been passed on down from the beginning of time throughout all men. We all have a portion of Adam's genetic physical code. But God did not give Adam a corrupted nature, though. He did not give in Adam a corrupted ated that was in bed in there and therefore it passed on to his children and his grandchildren, and his great grandchildren and so on and so on. throughout all generations of all time. That's not what God did when he created out when he quit made out of he made Adam good. He made Adam in such a way that he could do good Adam could obey God, but he didn't. He disobeyed God. And we disobeyed God. He said, The Father of lights our father, our, our heavenly father, who's describing as the Father lights in James chapter 113. Who says he tempts no one with evil? He Tim's no one to do evil he's not tempted by evil. Well, that God, the Father, Lyons cannot implant a corrupt nature. It would be contrary to its very nature. It would be against his own righteousness. It'd be contrary violation of his own holiness, His own purity. So no God did not implant in bed in Adam some corrupted nature that's going to be passed on down through his no Adam's sin, made him no longer blameless before he said he was blameless.

David Bunting  10:21
God had nothing to pronounce against Adam until he disobeyed Him. And so, Adam inflicted that blemish on himself. But it seemed to not make him though dis abled and indisposed to all goodness. Just because he committed that sin did not mean he could not obey God faithfully the rest of his days. Consider Cain, we know the story of Cain how Cain murdered his brother Abel. And that sinful act was a choice. Cain chose to act against God's law he chose even as against God's warning, God's admonishment there in Genesis chapter four. So you turned back there and you read those familiar verses. When God speaks to Cain. After not accepting his sacrifice, he says, Then the LORD said to Cain, why are you angry? And why is your countenance fallen? If you do well, will not your countenance be lifted up? And if you do not do well, sin is crouching out the door. Sin was crouching, he hasn't committed this sin he's about to do yet if there is tempting him, but he hasn't done it yet. So God says it's crouching out the door in his desires for you. But you must master it. Well, you know what happened? He didn't master the sin. He didn't master that evil desire is dead that sin master in him. But if a depraved nature was inherited, if Cain, if that's a huge if, and God doesn't suggest this at all, but if a depraved nature was inherited from Adam, and Cain inherited that thing, well, then where was Abels depraved nature, because both of them would have inherited it, they would have been equally corrupt, they would have been equally, you know, indisposed to goodness. But we know by scripture, by the word of the Holy Spirit, that angel, by fey, was accepted that able by faith, please God. Eva would not have been able to offer a sacrifice acceptable to God, if he had inherited a corrupted nature. So no, Cain didn't commit murder, because he inherited some, you know, corrupted nature, he committed murder because he had a choice and he made the wrong choice, he made the bad choice. He controlled his choices just like you and I do. He had a God given ability to master his ungodly desires, he had the ability and the opportunity to rule over his temptation, the temptation to do evil, but he chose poorly, he chose wrongly. Sin is a choice. It's a choice to go against. It's a choice to violate the holiness and the righteousness of God's laws of God's character. It is a choice to go against God's word to go against his warning to go against his promise. Sin, therefore, is a lawless practice, not an inherited corrupt nature. And when Roman says we have all sinned and fallen short of the glory, what Paul is saying, we have all made similar choices. He wasn't because somebody made us do it. No, we made that choice. We transgress God, we violated that which was good and holy, right, and chose something that was corrupt and wrong and unrighteous. As you think about you know, as you particularly are reaching out to your community and trying to teach them the gospel, and you're faced with those who are influenced by Catholicism or those influenced by Calvinism, you know, we do need to be able to answer the question can the guilt of sin or can sin itself be transmitted from parent to child by natural procreation and we've already implied is suggested No, it cannot, but Let's let's look at some of the principles we need to be equipped to show people scriptures. Now many of them will have some kind of defense and they will, you know, argue around and not accept the simple word of God. You know, read it was a well, it doesn't mean that it means something else than what you're reading.

David Bunting  15:20
But the thing is, if a corrupt nature, if the guilt of sin is passed on by natural conception and delivery, if that be true, a child from infancy then bears the nature and the guilt of not only his immediate father, but he bears the guilt and the nature of his entire family lineage. That's logical. If I have inherited Adam, I've also inherited everyone else down that line. Whatever my advantage, however, it goes back to Adam through Noah and all that, then I have inherited a corrupt nature from everybody. Because I am descended from Adam through God's procreation plan. Now true wisdom, true wisdom, laws, he discerned that a person is accountable for his own actions, truism logic to discern that a person is accountable for his own choices, not another's. On average, in every other kind of situation and discussion, people generally would agree with that logic. You're accountable for your choices, you're actually not for what someone else has done. For example, if I am not present, and I am not aware, when sin has been committed by another person. I wasn't there. I don't know anything about it. And so it but yet this person committed this crime committed this wrong committed this sin, even in a man's courts, I am not guilty, I am not a guilty accomplice. Now I can be a guilty accompany if I was president. If I in some way was associated with that wrong with that crime, I can become a guilty accomplice with it. But if I wasn't there, I didn't know anything about it. You know, I am removed from it. Even the courts of our lands, will argue the point that you are innocent, you are blameless in regard to that. Well, God's prophet Zeke you'll clearly backs up what we're trying to argue this evening. But how we're all sinners, and yes, Adam committed the first sin, but I'm not a sinner because of David bunting. Yeah, was a sinner is a sinner when I choose to sin, to transgress that which was against God, against his will. And God's prophet, his ego states very plainly that his son does not bear the guilt of his father's sin, but only the guilt of what he does himself. So going back to this passage in Ezekiel 18, just going to read just a few verses, as lengthy reading as the prophet makes the argument on regard to this point. But it was really start there kind of in the middle in verse 14, when it says, Now behold, he has a son, who observed all his father's sins, so So you just finished talking about a father sins, and his father has a son now, and the son has witnessed all of the sins his father's committed. And he and observing them does not do. Likewise. You have a son, who has a very wicked dad. And he seen it all. He knows it all, but he's not doing the same thing. He's not gonna follow in the footsteps of his dad. Because you know what his dad did. He knows what his dad has become through his actions. And so it says, instead, this son does not eat verse 15 of the mountain shrines, or lift up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, or defile his neighbor's wife, or oppress anyone or attain a pledge or commit robbery. He hasn't done any of those things implying those are the kinds of things his dad did. But on the positive side, these are things he is doing right he gives his bread to the hungry and covers the naked with it with clothing. He keeps his hand from the from the poor, does not take interest or increase but executes. My God is speaking here through easy cool. God says he executes My ordinances, and walks in mind statutes. He will not die for his father's iniquity, he will surely live. So even if a person even a child is raised in an environment that extremely sin sinful, God says, We can do differently. We don't have to follow the bad examples of others. And individual, any one of us can choose a different path. And so we're not automatically condemn because of somebody else. We're not automatically prayed because a parent was unrighteous and wicked, no, we have a choice. Every generation has a choice. And so here in the days of Zeke, you'll who was in captivity, in the land Bible, and among his fellow Jewish captains is preaching to them about God's judgment, and where the fault lies, and we don't have to make the same mistakes. Our fathers did. Verse 20, the person who sins will die, that's the one whose account the sinner is accountable for his own sins, the son will not bear the punishment for the father's iniquity, nor will the father bear the punishment for the son, it goes both ways. Each the sons generation is accountable and the father generation count each can count for themselves, the righteousness of the righteous will be upon himself and the wickedness the widow will be upon himself. sons and fathers during Zeke Hills time, did not bear the guilt, nor the nature of each other. And so therefore, neither did they inherit the sins of their forefathers, all the way back to Abraham, and even to Adam.

David Bunting  21:42
They did inherit that, no, God says no, every generation every individual's accountable for his own action, and that is still true today. And that's the point that Paul argues in Romans chapter three, where we so often turn to when talking about the need of salvation and accountability before God, and particularly quoting verse 23, is what we usually refer to for all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God. And that is true, all account would be both reasonable and that they can make a choice on their own. He says, God says, sadly, we all end up making a bad choice in one way or another, and violating

David Bunting  22:31
the very purpose we are here. The very reason that God has breathed life into us,

David Bunting  22:38
and we violate our purpose for existing on earth, by transgressing against our Creator. But in Romans chapter three, the emphasis is to try to bring out particularly to all people, Jewish, and Gentile, people like that we're all equal in the eyes of God, and no one is really better than the other, we all have sinned in one way or another. And so he makes the point here in Romans three that nobody is righteous. And this description, and Romans three is not talking about newborns, not talking about small children, is talking about people who turn aside from God. Let's be talking about this. So the description of Romans three nine through 18, is described being people who turn aside from God, they make a decision, they make a choice, to take a certain path. And when they take a path that goes against away from God, he says, You are not righteous, not one of you. So reading the passage here, what then are we better than they? Not at all? For we have already charged that both Jews and Greeks are all under sin. But why? Well, begins to expound on that as it is written there is none righteous, not even one there's no new understands there's no new seeks for God all have turned aside. There is that why they're sinners, why they're not righteous because they turned aside. Together, they have become useless. There's none who does good. There's not even one, the throat is an open grain with a tongues they keep deceiving. The poison of acid is under their lips, whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness. Their feet are swift to shed blood destruction and misery are in their past and the path of peace they have not known there is no fear of God before their eyes. This is not talking about babies. This is not talking about your newborns and not talking about small children. It's not talking here about an inherited corrupted nature and disposition but rather a chosen conduct were people chose to turn away from God. These verses you know some of Boom are taken from Psalm 14 and go back and look at the context there is talking about men who committed abominable deeds. Terrible things, is that language that is used to describe humanity today? They've all made similar decisions. Then when we violate God, when we go against his will and do that, which is not right, that which is not good, that which is not holy. When you think about the context here of not being righteous, it's really it in no way can describe an infant. You can no way describe a newborn, a small child a little baby. When you think about it, he says, okay, these you're not doing, you know, there's none righteous, He says, there's none who does good. When you think about doing good. You know, even even a baby can't do it can't carry that out one way or the other. And he goes on, it has a mouthful of sin. Well, no. You know, that baby can't do that. They're not talking yet. And he goes, his feet that are quick to to shed blood take like, well, a baby can't do that either. They haven't learned them you learn to walk yet? is in no way is Paul trying to say that, you know, we've inherited we say no, we have made choices. And these choices have been against God, it'd be in his character against his righteousness, and therefore because of that we are lost. But praise the Lord. We can be justified. And that's the point of Romans three is to convict us of our sin and then show us the remedy. But we need to be mindful of the fact that we are accountable. Every one of us each individual becomes accountable for what he does. And he's equally teen again, in verse four says the soul who sins will die, therefore I will judge you, or house of Israel, each according to his conduct declares the Lord God, repent and turn away from all your transgressions. Romans about turning away from God, hear God's calling, turn away from your sin, turn away from your transgressions, so that iniquity may not become a stumbling block to you. Cain did not do that.

David Bunting  27:33
And his iniquity became a stumbling block. And God is calling upon the people of captivity here through the property's eco unit to be turning away from your sins. Because I'm judging each one of you according each of your conducts. It is the individual that commits sin that is accountable for his conduct sin is a choice. Sin is an action it is not an inherited trait. If it is an inherited trait, if it's an inherited nature, then how can you repent? Because repentance is a choice to is a choice to turn away from God, but it also is a choice to turn back to God. And God is calling us to make a choice, to turn back to him to turn away from our sinfulness. God's command to repent implies that each one of us is in control of our actions. That we can repent, we can change our ways we can correct our sins and we can do right by the grace of God through Jesus Christ. In Galatians, five, the possible also emphasizes this point of accountability. The fact that the deeds of the flesh are practices that are contrary to the law. In verse 21, he says, Now the deeds of the flesh, not the nature of the flesh, but the deeds of the flesh are evident. They are evident he says, you know, we know of which I forewarn you just as I have forewarn you that those who practice such things will not inherit the kingdom of God, the sins of the flesh, our deeds, the sins, the flesh, our works. The sins of the flesh, are choices of action, an action that we take, not something that we inherit, we can't blame anybody else, but ourselves when we sin. Does environment influence can environment put pressure on us? Can environment tempt us? Yes. But the bottom line is when the sin is committed we each do that ourselves, whether with our words, our hands, our feet, whatever, we make the final decision ourselves. And in Galatians, chapter five, this idea of practicing such implies that you know, it is really comes with it the idea of a habit, an ongoing thing. And we need to stop doing that. We need to stop practicing it, we need to stop going back to the same sin again and again. And again. No, we got to put it into it. And we can do that with the help of the Lord. We can do that, with the help of truth. We can do it with God's plan. unrepentant doers of sin, unrepentant sinners, Galatians, five says, are not going to happen. unrepentant sinners are not going to be saved. But God doesn't desire that. In for there. Therefore, he's long suffering. And that's why you're not here. He's still here today. But your God gave us another day, to live, but also to repent. Because he desires all of us here in this room, as well as many more outside of this room, to come to knowledge of God, of the truth of Jesus Christ, and be cleansed by the power of Jesus Christ. God's judgment is going to, you know, as we close this lesson is going to be you know, the means by which he recompenses every sinner according to what every sinner has done in his life, as a Corinthians 510, as the Apostle Paul speaks to the brethren of Corinth, and to us still today, of the work of the Spirit. And we are urged to think of these things. Therefore, we also have as our ambition whether at home, were absent to be pleasing to Him. Why, why should I make it my ambition? What's your ambition? What's your goal in life? Well, for every soul, our goal in life should be to serve God, and make it to heaven, that needs to be your ambition, not your education,

David Bunting  32:30
not your career, not even your family. Now, all of those in their proper place, in accord with God's will, has benefit and goodness to it. But that's not our ambition. At least it shouldn't be. Our ambition should be, as Paul says, whether at home or has to be pleasing to Him. For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ, so that each one may be recompense for his deeds in the body, according to what he has done, whether good or bad, did Paul preach against sin, you better believe he preached against him. And he did his best to convict sinners. So those convicted sinners could be saved by the gospel of Jesus Christ, you and I, each one of us are accountable to God. And we're going to give an account to God in the end. And so, what are you going to do about it? What are you going to do about the sin that might be in your life tonight? If their sin, sin separates, and the wages of sin is death, not just physical, but the greater is spiritual and eternal? And so what are you gonna do back because you committed the sin, I've committed a sin. And God says, I have a solution for you, I have a remedy for you. But you're going to have to do the repenting yourself. You're going to do the believing yourself and you're not doing it, obeying yourself. It's a gift. But you're gonna have to make a decision. Who's going to be your master God, or sin. If you're here tonight, you're not a Christian. We don't encourage you to consider the gospel of Jesus Christ, who Jesus is what he did, and encouraged you to believe in Him with all your heart that He is God's Son. And with that faith, to repent to the sins you have committed and to be buried with Him, in Baptists confessing that faith before others, because that's God's plan to receive justification by grace, through faith, that's God's plan and even not on that, and you're a sinner, and you don't do that and you're not ready for the judgment day then you're lost. You're lost forever. But God doesn't want that. Nor do we we can help you anyway spiritually to make your life right with God. Please come now make your wishes known where we stand and sing the song has been selected.
