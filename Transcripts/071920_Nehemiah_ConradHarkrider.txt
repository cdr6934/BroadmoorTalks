If you want to be opening your Bibles to the book of Nehemiah chapter one.

It's great to see each of you here this morning. Appreciate the prayer that Lisa said for us and the songs that brother Swafford lead and for the words that Phil had to say, at the Lord's Supper, and what a how true it is what Norm said about the blessing of being able to be with other Christians and, and to encourage each other and to study God's word and to pray together. If I want you to think about someone that you've known in your life that has always seemed to be prepared for anything that comes that might come up, I was working on my car, one time I was having some issues, and a friend had volunteered to assist. And he was helping me. And by helping me, I mean that he was telling me exactly what to do. And I was following his instructions. But there was a piece inside the engine that we needed to take off. And as I removed one of the bolts, I tried to get my fingers around it, and I dropped it down into the parts of the engine. And I was trying to get my hand down in there, but it was in a tight spot. And my friend went back to his truck and got out this little thing that looked like a pin. But it extended out into a pole. And on the end of the pole, it had a magnet. And so he put it down in there. And within a couple of seconds. He had retrieved that bolt and I looked at him and I said do you realize how long it would have taken me to get that thing out if I were by myself. And he just laughed and he said it happens all the time. But he was ready. He had the right tools he was prepared, we might say he was the right man for the job. The book of Nehemiah describes a great time of difficulty and uncertainty for God's people. Their path forward as a nation was in jeopardy. But it's during this time that God uses this man Nehemiah to help his people. Nehemiah is going to restore the city to rebuild the walls and to help the people reclaim their faith in God. And I like for us to examine the character of this man and to think about how he was able to lead God's people during this time. What we see from the book of Nehemiah is that he was the right man for the job. Read with me in Nehemiah chapter one beginning of verse one. It says the words of Nehemiah, the son of Hakka Leia, it came to pass in the month of Kislev. In the 20th year as I was in shoe Shin, the citadel that hen and I one of my brethren came with men from Judah. And I asked them concerning the Jews who had escaped, who had survived the captivity and concerning Jerusalem. And they said to me, the survivors who are left from the captivity in the province are they're in great distress and reproach. The wall of Jerusalem is also broken down and its gates are burned with fire.

Conrad Harkrider  03:38
A couple of things to notice here at the beginning of the book Nehemiah is writing in first person. He says in verse one that I was in the capital, I was in Susa, the Citadel, much of the book is written from this first person perspective. Susa was the or shoe sham in the New King James Version was the capital of the Persian Empire. And so we get some information about when this book is written, it's during the time of exile, the 17 time periods, the the captivity, and then also the return from captivity, but he is living in a foreign place. During this first part, the book starts off with this report of bad news. There's a group of men that come back from the land of Judah and Nehemiah asked them about the affairs of the people and how the city is doing. And the report that they give is not good. They tell him that those who have survived are in this great distress. They're in trouble that the walls of the city are still broken down. Let's get our bearings here. If we go back to The time when Jerusalem was destroyed in Second Kings chapter 25 And verse 10, were told about how the Babylonians came into the city. And they destroyed the temple with fire. They burned down the palace and the walls of Jerusalem the walls of the city were broken down. This happened in 586 BC. In Ezra chapter one and verse two were told about the decree of Cyrus. During the exile, Cyrus issue issues a decree that allows the first exiles to return back to the land, they're under the leadership of the rubble, they would rebuild the temple, but the walls of the city remain broken down. This is in 538 BC. It has read chapter seven and verse eight. We're told about a second return back to the city, Ezra, the priest leads a group of exiles and they make a number of reforms and improvements to the city but the walls continued to be broken down. Well, that brings us to Nehemiah chapter one. And it says in verse one, that this was the 20th year, the 20th year referring to the 20th year of the reign of the king of Persia, King Artaxerxes chapter two and verse one. But Nehemiah is living during this time, and he will make a request to return to the city in this happens in 445 BC. That's a lot of dates and information. But what I want you to focus in on the number that you can remember, is 9393 years, that's how long it has been since the time when Nebuchadnezzar came and destroyed the walls until 445 BC, when Nehemiah will go back into the city to begin the rebuilding process, but it has been 90 years. And the walls have remained broken down walls were essential to any ancient city. They were necessary, they were important for protection and for security without walls, a opposing army or an enemy force could come in, and they could destroy or they could take possession. And so Nehemiah understood how critical it was, he understood the that the future success of the city was dependent upon these walls. And so when this bad Report is brought back, this is not something that you want to hear when you ask the question, How are things going back home, these men deliver the report. This is bad news. But this is the reality of the situation that God's people were living in. So what does Nehemiah do about it? What is his reaction? First of all, we see that Nehemiah was the right man for the job, because of what it says in verse four. Look at verse four, it says, so it was when I heard these words that I sat down and wept and mourn for many days. I was fasting and praying before the God of heaven. When Nehemiah hears the reports,

Conrad Harkrider  08:18
he shows concern for others, he is moved with compassion. It says that he begins to weep and to mourn. And did you notice it was not just for a few minutes. But it says for days that he was in this state of mourning, he's shaken by this. The text says that he stops eating, he begins to fast. And the purpose of that would be to focus all of his attention and his energy on prayer on petitioning the Lord. It was common for people to make requests or petition to God. And this way, if you remember in Second Samuel chapter 12, when their son is born to the wife, David son is born to the wife of Uriah. We're told that David wins and lay down on the floor, he refused to eat for seven days as he was making prayer request to the Lord. But what's amazing about Nehemiah, and this news that he receives is that this does not personally affect him. Nehemiah is living in the Persian capital, some 900 miles away from Jerusalem. He's not directly impacted by what's going on there. In fact, he has a good job as the cup bearer for the king. He's living in security, he has food he has protection. And so why would he be concerned about this? Because we see that Nehemiah was a man who showed compassion. He cared about what went on. In the lives of his brothers, when he saw pain and suffering, he was moved with empathy. One of the dangers for us of receiving so many blessings from God, physical blessings, and the comforts of spiritual blessings of being able to worship and to read God's word and, and just all of the things that are around us that bless our lives, one of the dangers of having those things is that we can become blind. It can cause us to be numb to the difficulties and the the challenges and troubles that other people are dealing with. Because those are not my problems. It's not something that I personally am being affected by. And so thinking about Nehemiah do we identify with the struggles of other people, when we hear about Christians, when we hear about God's people are living in other parts of the world, maybe very far away from us, some of them in countries where the government is not as stable, where there's not as much infrastructure where poverty is very high, but do we? Are we sympathetic to the needs of others? And not just sympathetic, but does it produce within us a desire to help and to assist people, Christians who are living in other places, the Bible says that we should be people who show empathy. And that means that even if it's not our family, or one of our children that's been affected, that we still show concern. Romans chapter 12, and verse 15, says that God's people are to be those who rejoice with those who rejoice and weep with those who weep. And so it is maybe your life is going well, maybe you still have your job and your health and your family that's around you. Maybe you are living in the modern day capital of Susa. But I would say that we need to look around us, we need to see the needs, we need to acknowledge that brother or sister who is hurting who's in need of encouragement, and help, and to offer and to extend ourselves to those around us. You say why can't even be around people right now? How can I possibly help sometimes help comes in the form of just a willingness to listen? Sometimes it's just being willing to listen to another person, share what they're going through. You know, we don't always have the ability to fix or to solve a person's problems. There's some issues that people face that won't find resolution in this life.

Conrad Harkrider  12:50
But we can show our love and our support by taking the time to listen and that's what we see in Nehemiah, he had concern for other people. But not only did he show compassion, but Nia was the right man, for the job for leading God's people. Because of what it says in verse six. Notice verse six, it says, please let your ear be attentive and your eyes open, that you may hear the prayer of Your servant which I pray before you now, day and night for the children of Israel, your servants, and confess the sins of the children of Israel, which we have sinned against you. Nehemiah was the right man for the job because he fervently prayed to God. Did you notice that he is offering this prayer night and day praying to the Lord on behalf of the people? It's interesting when you look at the words of this prayer, how many similarities there are with other parts of Scripture with other things that had already been recorded in Scripture? Verse Five is almost exactly like the beginning of the prayer that Daniels Daniel offers and Daniel chapter nine and verse four. But there's a big difference between Daniel's prayer and Daniel nine and the prayer that Nehemiah offers here in chapter one. As Daniel when he concludes his prayer God sends the angel Gabriel to speak with him. There's nothing mentioned about a divine response to Nehemiah. We'll talk about that a little more at the end of the lesson. But this prayer echoes the truths that have already been revealed to God's people. Look at verse eight. In verse eight, it says, Remember, I pray the Word that you commanded Your servant Moses saying, if you are unfaithful, I will scatter you among the nations but if you return to Me and keep My commandments and do them, though some of you are cast to the farthest part of the heavens yet I will gather them from there. When Moses spoke to the people in Deuteronomy, chapter 30, he had told them What would happen if they first sucked the commands of the Lord, but he gave them hope he offered them this promise to say that if they turn back, if they turn back to the Lord, that He would restore them, and bring them back to the land. And so Nehemiah is praying from these passages from these scriptures, and one of the best ways we think about praying to God, sometimes we don't know the right words to say, sometimes we, we can't express what's on our heart. We don't even know where to begin. But when we're feeling that way, one of the things that we can do is to pray from God's Word, to use scripture, to take one of the Psalms to use something that David said, during a time of crisis and to pray that to the Lord and Psalm 86. And verse one, a prayer of David, he says, Hear me, Lord, and answer me for I am poor and needy, guard my life for I am faithful to us, save your servant who trusts in You, You are my God, have mercy on me, Lord, for I call to you all day long. bring joy to your servant, Lord, for I put my trust in you. Nehemiah was a man of prayer. And he used the prayers and the words from the Scripture, in order to express himself to the Lord. In Nehemiah chapter two, we're told about a time when Nehemiah is ready to go in before the king to make his petition. And the text tells us that as he is going into the courts of the king, before he makes his request that he prays, he prays to God, almost as if it's in the process of him walking up to the king, or before the king, he makes this prayer request. And it shows us that Nehemiah was a man who was constantly praying throughout the day, not. Prayer does not always have to be something that is long and drawn out and eloquently stated. But fervently praying means that we are thinking about we are talking to the Lord on a regular basis. So when we're in the car, or when we find ourselves being pressured at work, or when we face temptation, or we're about to lose our patience with someone. We can pray to God, we can ask for God's favor and his guidance and strength. Did you catch what was said in the beginning of verse four? Look back at the beginning of verse four. He says, so it was when I heard these words that I sat down and wept. And I mourn for many days, and I was fasting and praying.

Conrad Harkrider  17:47
It says as soon as I heard these words, the NET Bible says when I heard these things, I sat down abruptly when Nehemiah is faced with terrible news. And he receives this report back about his brothers and sisters in distress in the walls of the city being broken down. What is the very first thing that he does? When we're faced with crisis? What's our first response? When we get the news? Do we call a family member or text a friend? Do we pull out our phone and we start to Google so we can read all of the information in the background? And the statistics? Do we turn on the television so we can hear what the commentators have to say about it? Do we just block it out and we go for a walk? Do we head to the kitchen and make some of our comfort food? What we see in the life of Nehemiah is that when he was faced with distressing situations, the first thing he did was to bow his knees and to pray. Prayer is such a vital part of our connection to the Lord. It is our gateway into receiving strength and comfort from God. First Peter five and verse seven says that we are to cast all of our anxieties and cares upon upon Him because He cares for you. We've certainly been challenged over the last few months. There's been a lot of things happening in the world that are outside of our control, but I have to ask myself what is my prayer life looks like? Have my prayers increased? Have they decreased have they just stayed the same? Over the past couple of days the weather here in Middle Tennessee has become increasingly hot. And if you've been outside any you know that you can't walk out the doors for about a couple of minutes and you start sweating. Well what would happen if you spent the entire day out in the sun Walking around working in your yard working at your house, and you weren't drinking any fluids. Well, it's easy to imagine that it's probably happened to many of us, you become lightheaded, you start to feel dizzy, you feel weak. If it gets extreme, you can get heatstroke, and it can even be life threatening. Prayer is like water to our soul, it's that refreshment that we need. And so I would encourage us as the temperature as the environment as the world as the as the condition starts to heat up. Don't turn away from the thing that refreshes your soul. Don't neglect that amazing blessing that God has given to us Nehemiah prayed fervently, we also see that he was the right man for the job. Because of what he says at the end of verse six, at the end of verse six, he says, Your servants, we confess the sins of the children of Israel, which we have sinned against you both my father's house and I have sinned, we have acted very corruptly against you. And if not kept the commandments, the statutes nor the ordinances which you commanded Your servant, Moses, Nehemiah accepted responsibility for his actions. Did you notice the language he says, I and my father's house, we have sinned, he doesn't try to shift the blame here. He doesn't say the reason that we were taken into captivity is because all of the nations that were around us, they influenced us, it's their fault. That's the reason we were led into sin. He doesn't point the finger at the Jews who are already living in the land. He doesn't say, well, the cap, the people have already gone back. They're just they're being lazy. And they're not doing what they need to be doing. They're not rebuilding, like they should. He doesn't blame his fathers or the people who came before him. But instead, he takes responsibility, he makes it personal to himself. He realizes that he's not perfect, and that he and his father's house have broken the covenant that God made with them. And so they have played a part in why God had rejected His people. Even though he has never presumably been to Jerusalem. He's never lived in that area. He recognized that he was part of the problem that God's people as a whole had broken the covenant and he includes himself. In that indictment.

Conrad Harkrider  22:47
Jesus told a hyperbole about a man who was trying to help get a speck out of his brother's eye. But there was a problem with that, because Jesus says that this man who was trying to help, he himself had a log or a playing protruding out of his heart out of his own eye. How ridiculous would it be if you went in to get surgery on one of your eyes, and the doctor came into the operating room and he had a pole sticking out from his face? How can he possibly help you in that condition? But yeah, that's what happens when we neglect and overlook our own failings and shortcomings. Instead of accepting responsibility, instead of acknowledging that we have said that we need help, instead of resolving to remove those things, no matter how difficult it may be, sometimes we are just content to let them stay there. And sadly, what happens is that problems don't just get rid of themselves, they grow worse, they become bigger and more dangerous and more difficult to remove from our lives. The last time I saw my grandfather in person was 2017. He lived in California, and he made a trip out to Nashville to visit us. And at the time, it didn't know it'd be the last but he passed away a few months after that. But during our stay during his stay, one morning, we were visiting. And he told me about a time when my brothers and I when we were younger, we had gone out to stay with him and my grandmother. And at the time we were acting. We were young, and we were fighting and kind of crazy hard to imagine that that would happen. But one afternoon we're being kind of rowdy and my grandfather said that he lost control of his temper, and that he disciplined me too harshly. That was 20 years ago that that had happened. I told my grandfather that I wasn't holding a grudge against him. And then in fact, whatever it happened, I probably deserved what I had received. But after all that time, he felt it was important to say that he was sorry. It doesn't take much courage to talk your way out of a problem. It doesn't require character to shift blame and to point the finger at someone else. But when we stand up and we say, I made a mistake, I was wrong in this situation. When we apologize and say, I'm sorry, to the people that we've heard, that shows integrity, and character and heart. And that's the type of person that God is looking for to lead his people. Finally, Nehemiah was the right man for the job because he used his position for good. At the end of the chapter in verse 11, we're given an interesting bit of information about Nehemiah. And the position that he held, it says that he was the cup bearer for the king. The cup bearer was an extremely important job during this time, assassinations and trying to overtake the throne was a common thing during this time. And so in many ways, the cut bear was the last line of defense, to protect the king from being killed, it would have been a person who was trusted and respected by the king. But it was more than just tasting the wine and the food before the king ate it, the cup bear was close to the royal family, he was in the presence of the king. And so that meant he had a certain level of influence. He was like an advisor or a counselor to the king. When Nehemiah hears about what was happening in Jerusalem to the people, he does more than just feel sorry for them.

Conrad Harkrider  26:57
We see that Nehemiah was a man of action throughout the book again and again, he takes action when he sees that there was a need. Someone might look at this and think, Well, what can Nehemiah possibly do? He's living hundreds of miles away. His job doesn't even relate to rebuilding walls. How could he possibly help. But we see Nehemiah used his position. He used to standing before one of the most powerful men in the world, the king of Persia to make a request on behalf of the people. Another thing that's interesting to note about Nehemiah is that he was not a prophet, like Haggai or Malikai. He was not a priest like Ezra, he was not of the royal lineage legs are available. from a Jewish perspective. Nehemiah is a lay man, he's an ordinary person. Throughout the book, we don't read about any miraculous visions or signs like Daniel received. Nehemiah works through ordinary processes. He prays to God, he uses the position that he's been given. He makes requests to make progress for the Lord. And when you look at what he was able to accomplish, physically, with rebuilding the walls of the city, and what he was able to accomplish spiritually with helping restore the people and turn them back to God is nothing short of amazing. And so what that says to you and me is that we don't have to have some type of miraculous power, some type of supernatural gift, or amazing family status or ability in order to do work for the Lord. But rather, God has given all of us each one of us opportunities. He's placed in our hands, resources, blessings, things that are in our life, that maybe we are the only person that is in that situation that can help in that setting or in that place. And so how are we using our position for good Often it requires us to open our eyes, to see the needs, and then to take action, to use our resources and to be a vessel for God's purposes. And when we take our talents, our blessings, our abilities, and we use them in this way we can work and help God's Kingdom progress and be built up in our generation. Nehemiah was the right man for the job because he cared about other people. He was a man who was not just focused on the physical but he knew that God ultimately was the one who had the power to help. And so he fervently prayed to the Lord. Nehemiah recognize that he wasn't above the people that he wasn't perfect. He accepted responsibility for his actions and he used what he had been given to help those around him We're going to close with a song this morning. It's an opportunity to encourage you in whatever way that may be necessary to make your relationship and your connection to God, stronger to make it what it ought to be. So that God can provide us that strength and that guidance so that we can build and prosper and to build up his kingdom in this life if there's something that we can do to encourage or help you this morning. Then make that known now as together we we stand in scene
