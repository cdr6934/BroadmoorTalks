Good morning. It's good to see everyone here today, it's certainly good that we have an opportunity to come here and worship our God. It's always good to be with, with brethren with those that are praising God, I appreciate worshiping with you this morning. Michael to look at a lesson from Exodus, may be surprised by that. But in the wilderness, as Israel was traveling to Mount Sinai, they found themselves in a difficult situation, they found themselves in a barren wasteland, they were in the wilderness. And as they were in the middle of the wilderness, they found what would probably be my worst nightmare. And that is they were without food, they were without water. And it would be bad enough able to if it were an individual that were going through the wilderness, but this was a mighty nation. This was a large amount of people. And as they went into the wilderness, they found themselves without food, and water. I'd like to talk for just a few moments this morning about developing grateful hearts in the wilderness, will notice that the Israelites did not have a grateful heart in the wilderness. In fact, their first instinct and what they continued to do was to complain. They found themselves in a difficult situation, and they responded with complaints. You know, in comparison to their situation, we we are not, in general, in this country, in a wilderness. We're not in a situation where we find ourselves without, in fact, we have plenty. But I would suggest that it's not the situation that really determines our hearts. In fact, you could take an ungrateful person and put them in a resorts where everything is provided where they have everything given to them were servants on them hand in hand, and you will find complaints. On the other hand, you can take someone that has a grateful heart, and you can put them in the wilderness. And they can respond with thankfulness, with reliance and trust upon God. So it's not the situation that determines our hearts. The situation often amplifies our hearts or makes it known or reveals our hearts. But rather, we need to be like the apostle Paul, who said for I've learned to be content in whatever situation, I find myself. So we may be in the wilderness. But I'd like to suggest that we need to develop grateful hearts, even in the wilderness even in tough times. And I would say at all times.

It's interesting, as we look to First Corinthians chapter 10, and verse 11. There that passage says Now these things happen to them as an example, but they were written down for our instruction. And one of the examples there is it looks back to the old testament is of the Israelites that we might learn not to grumble or complain like they did. So I'd like to look at that as an example this morning and notice a few things that we see. First of all, let me set the stage by talking about in Exodus chapters 15 through 17, we find three occasions back to back where the Israelites find themselves in a similar situation. And so first of all, we find it at Mara, on their travels, that there was a lack of drinkable water. There was water that was there, but it was undrinkable. It was. It was too bitter for them to drink. And so the people grumbled, and they complained, and God provided for them there is Moses called out to God there was a law that was able to be thrown in to make the water sweeter, drinkable. And so God provided for them. As they left there. They came to elim, where there were 12 springs, where there was an abundance of water for the people. So not only at Mara, but as they left there, they had water to drink will also notice that at the Wilderness of Sin and chapter 16, as they come there, they did not have the food that they wanted. They were hungry. And so once again, they grumbled, they complained, and they accused Moses of taking them into the wilderness and trying to kill them. There was a lack of food there, and they didn't see what they could do to get it. Once again, as Moses calls out to God. God provides for the people and he gives them bread from heaven. He gives them manna. This was clearly from God. It was from Heaven itself. And so we see that they were provided for with food and the Wilderness of Sin. We also see in chapter 17 The very beginning of chapter 17, that they once again found themselves with a lack of water. And instead of changing their attitude, they responded with the same attitude that they had before. And they complained. And they grumbled, and they said, we have a lack of water. Once again, God provided for the people, you might consider as well that this is part of a larger section of God's provision, God had already brought them out of the land of Egypt, he had brought them out of slavery, he had already allowed them to cross the red sea when they were stuck between the rock and the hard place, the waters of the sea and the ensuing Egyptian army, and God provided a way of escape. Even after this passage on our three examples of complaints about food we see that God provides for this former group of slaves, provides for them victory in battle against the amplicons. God is a God of provision. And that comes through time and time again. But the question is not what kind of God it is, although that's certainly important to understand. But what kind of hard are we going to have before God? What kind of heart did the Israelites have? Well, if we are to develop grateful hearts in the wilderness, one of the first things we must do is remember, rather than forget, remember, rather than forget, I'm not talking about when we get to our old days, as I'm beginning to go into a room and say, Why did I come in here? I'm not talking about where did I place my keys, but but rather, I'm talking about an attitude that recognizes the blessings that we have. I've told you already that there, there was a long string of provisions by God. But what had the Israelites done when they came to Mara, the Wilderness of Sin and referencing? Well, they had forgotten what God had done for them. They had forgotten the provisions and the blessings that God had provided for them. As I taught through this lesson in class, Nora mentioned to me a good point. And that is, if you look at Numbers chapter 33, in the itinerary of the Israelites, Mara was not their first stop. So previously, as we come to those different locations of Ramsey, Succoth, Etham, and pie hierarchy,

Jeremy Sweets  07:32
we see that God apparently had provided for them food and water. God is a God of provision and had given to the people yet they forgot those blessings. How often is it when we come to our first challenge, that we forget everything that God has done, we forget what God has provided for us. Well, that is a easy way to head toward an ungrateful heart, if you will simply forget. Instead, we need to remember, we need to remember what God has done. God's desire has been that as people would remember what he has done in Exodus 13, and see, brought them out of the land of Canaan, he gave them feast Memorial feasts. And he says in verse three, remember this day in which you came out of Egypt, out of the house of slavery, for by a strong hand, the Lord brought you out from this place. And so he wanted them to continually look back and remember. And if we're to have grateful hearts in the wilderness today, we will learn to remember to think back to dwell upon the many blessings that God has provided. It's interesting, also from this passage, that even after so many blessings that were provided for the people, that God only make two points, and I'm stuck in between them. So let me start over with this. God wanted them to remember by the feast, a second way that God wanted them to remember is that in chapter 16, after he had given them the manner, he ordered that a portion of that bread would be kept, because he wanted them to remember. And so they were to remember this throughout their generations. Sometimes remembering is not only dwelling upon what God has done for us in our own personal lives, but sometimes that extends into generations. It extends into the past. And so we can remember what God has done for us by opening up the scriptures and seeing his history there and seeing his provision because that, in essence, is a provision for us as ultimately he brought Jesus Christ. Okay, my next point in chapter seven 17 At the end of these three examples, it says there that he called the name of the place Mesa and Maratha, because of the quarreling of the people of Israel. And because they tested the Lord by saying, is the Lord among us or not? I think this highlights the fact that they had forgotten. Time and time again, God had provided but yet they say there is God even here. Once again, I would suggest that the first time we come into a trouble the first time we come into any instance where we are lacking. Sometimes our first reaction is say, God must not be here. I prayed, and God did not provide for me. I've asked this of God, and he didn't give it to me, God must not be there, God must not be listening. But as you read through the story, it's very clear that God is there. And as we dwell upon how God has been there, for his people, it's very clear today that God exists, He hears us, and He is there. And so let us not be like the Israelites who said, his god among us or not. So we need to remember rather than forget. The second thing I would suggest we do is that we need to give thanks rather than grumble

Jeremy Sweets  11:19
our miles and what we say is a reflection of our hearts. And so when we look at the Israelites, we see that they grumbled, I don't know about you, but that word has a particular image that comes to my mind, I can see people grumbling almost as much as I can hear. It's kind of a low rumbling. It's kind of a muttering under the breath. It's kind of I'm upset. Words don't always even have to come out to grumble, do they? It's an attitude. I'm upset. I'm mad. I'm not getting what I want. And as the Israelites came to each one of these places, that word grumble is used at each place. They grumbled at Mara. they grumbled in the Wilderness of Sin. they grumbled at ref, or Diem. They were mad, upset, they were bitter. You know, their hearts match that water. At the very beginning of Mara, they were bitter and upset. What they needed to do instead was give thanks to recognize all the provisions that God had given and simply make a request. Sometimes I tell my children when they begin to complain and grumble, I don't have this or that, or have you asked, sometimes we skip over that step. When we don't have something we simply grumble. We complain. But we don't make a simple entry here request. And it may be that the answer would be no, but couldn't we at least start with thankful hearts that issue or request you know, grumbling and giving thanks sound different to as well don't think grumbling is under the breath, a man or girl rah grumbling. You're not always speaking your words loudly. And clearly. Often you're kind of saying them to their to yourself. But Giving thanks is something we can say loudly. And clearly. It's nothing we have to be ashamed of nothing we have to hide. It's not coming from an emotional outburst of being bitter. But rather it's a calculated statement of thanks. And so you can see the difference in how the words come out. And you can see the difference of the hearts with each one of those. We need to be not like the Israelites who grumble but we need to be a people that give thanks. And let me stress that we can give thanks at all times, even in the wilderness. The Israelites had They considered that their trial had come as a direct result of the many blessings that they had. They were only in the wilderness because God had brought them out of slavery. But often we forget that though we we don't tend to look at the big picture of what God is doing in our lives. We don't see all those blessings but rather, an ungrateful heart will zero in on will focus only on the problem. And they'll grumble and complain. Yes, we need to be thankful at all times. There's many scriptures that talk about this. For example, in Ephesians five in verse 20, Paul says, give thanks always in for everything to God the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. Give thanks always. We can always give thanks to God in whatever situation we find ourselves in Colossians, three and 17 And whatever you do in word or deed, do everything in the name With the Lord Jesus giving thanks to God the Father through Him. And probably most clear from Paul in First Thessalonians 518, give thanks in all circumstances, for this as the will of God in Christ Jesus for you. We can give thanks in every circumstance, we find ourselves. We know, we might not be happy with everything that's going on. This life is filled of trials. But that's a challenge for us, isn't it? But it's a challenge we need to take on. As Christians, we of all people should have grateful thankful hearts. Because whatever else happens, Jesus Christ died on the cross for our sins, and one day we can be in Heaven with Him. What else matters? Does it really matter if your internet went out one day, if your car breaks down, and I can go through a number of other things. Those are light examples. There may be more serious things I don't want to make fun of and I'm not trying to make light of anything. But does cancer really matter?

Jeremy Sweets  16:12
If you were to get something that severe, sure, that's painful. But ultimately, if our goal is to be in heaven with God, and that is our goal, in light of eternity, that doesn't matter. That doesn't matter. We need to give thanks at all times, that's where the Israelites failed, and where we sometimes fail. Let us be people that give thanks. Let us be people that appreciate rather than blame fee notice that those that are bitter, and grumbling often lash out at other people. If you notice that of your own self, when people are upset, they lash out at others. In chapter 15, verse 24, there it says that the grumbling of the Israelites were directed at Moses. Moses was the one that had put his life on the line to lead the Israelites out of slavery. He was the one that had faced Pharaoh, and had gone before him, he was the one that had brought the people out. But notice what they say and what they do. They grumble at Moses, as if Moses had decided that there would be no food in the wilderness. They blame Moses, the Wilderness of Sin, the people took it a step further, and they accused Moses of trying to kill them. When you're when you have a bitter heart, you dismiss or you, you consider the motors of everyone else to be negative. The world is against me. It's all about me. And so they look to Moses and say that you're trying to kill us. You've brought us out into the wilderness to kill this whole assembly with hunger, and again at refuge aim and chapter 17. In verse three, why did you bring us up out of Egypt to kill us and our children and our livestock with thirst? They began to blame Moses, but what we need to do instead is have some appreciation. Even if we have trials and struggles, that doesn't mean the whole world is against us. That doesn't mean everyone else have the has evil motives. We need to appreciate others, how far would it have gone for their attitude and what they were experiencing if they could have appreciate Moses and what he had done, even though we're hungry, we appreciate see a bitter heart lashes out against others, but a grateful hearts will take the time to appreciate others. Bitterness creates really a twisted perception as well. It's not even accurate, that Moses brought them out to kill them. But that's what bitterness will do will twist the story in such a way that everyone is against us. Moses had risked his life for them, instead of blaming Moses, they could have pre appreciated him what he had done for them, they could have given him the benefit of the doubt or clearly seen that he had done these things for them. So the point here is don't multiply pain upon pain. When you're suffering, Don't lash out at others. Don't blame others. Don't bring your heart ache upon them and multiply it. We can lessen it with a grateful heart that will at least account for the blessings we have and appreciate others in our life. We also need to live in the present rather than the past or even the future. And I think this lesson comes through in this account as well. Often what we do is we look to the past we Look to the glory days when we face a problem. I didn't have this problem back then. Back then everything was so great. I didn't face these challenges and these problems, but really what we're doing when we do that is sticking our head in the sand. We're saying I don't want to deal with the current problem. I simply want to dream about a better day. ungrateful people often long for a whitewashed fictitious past that never really happened. But yet they glorify in their minds. They long for the good old days, when there was no problems, but only good times. The Israelites did this, didn't they? In chapter 16, verse three, they said, wood that we had died by the hand of the Lord and the land of Egypt, when we set by the meat pots and ate bread to the full, you remember that slavery? The good old days, we had all the food we wanted?

Jeremy Sweets  20:56
Do you see how they have twisted things so that slavery was what was good, they're gonna say later in the account in the wilderness, oh, that we could go back to Egypt. You see, they had glorified their past in a twisted way. And they long for their past. Instead of living in the present, and relying upon God, they hit their head in the sand and said, I wish I could be in the past. You know, sometimes we do this with the future as well. Instead of relying on God, and trusting him in the present moment, we say, you know, what I'm going to do is I'm going to hoard as much as I can, I'm going to become as self reliant as I can, I'm going to get as many possessions. You know, in this country, we have the unique ability to acquire a lot of stuff. And we can acquire money when we if we get our bootstraps and go to town, right. So sometimes we can think that, that is my salvation. I don't have to face problems today, because I can get more and more stuff thing. The Israelites did this as well. God told the people, that they were to only collect a day's worth of manna. And he did this in order to test them so that they would rely on him. And when the bread first came from heaven, many of them gathered multiple days, but that that would rot. God didn't want them to hoard. God didn't want them to be self sufficient by what they had done in the present. He wanted them to trust him in the present moment. And that's a good lesson for us today, as well. We don't need to live in the past. We don't need to live in the future either. We need to trust God with what He has given. The rich man and Luke 12 comforted himself by the fact that he had built bigger barns. But God said, you fool this night your soul is required of you in the things you have repaired, whose will they be? So is the one who lays up treasure for himself and is not rich toward God? If we are banking, on our possessions, our wealth, our stability, or ourselves, that's the wrong thing to bank on. Because there will come a day when our soul is required on us, of us. And the question will be, then we trust in God, or do we trust in ourselves? Another point of this is made in Matthew chapter six, when it comes to worry, do we? Maybe we haven't provided for the future, but we simply worry about the future. And we spend our anxiety and our thoughts continually devoted to that, am I going to have enough? Jesus said in Matthew chapter six, do not be anxious, saying What shall we eat? Or what shall we drink or what she shall we wear? For the Gentiles seek after all these things and your heavenly Father knows that you need them all. But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness and all these things will be added to you. Let us not be like the Israelites who tried to live in the past or the future. But let us live in the present with appreciation for what we have, and trusting God for what we don't. So, let us address the present situation. Let us also be humble rather than selfish. Much of what we have discussed could be summed up with this type of heart. The Israelites had a selfish outlook. When they faced a problem. You'll notice that their language was all patterned around themselves. What are we going to drink what is with us? And it was about what we don't have and what we want and what we need. A humble heart takes a step back and considers not just the present difficulty but considers all that God has done appreciates all that God has done, does not demand and say I am owed this, I deserve this. All of this should come to me right now. But rather with humbly request would humbly go to God, with thankfulness for what we have appreciation for what we do have and what God has done for us. And with a humble heart coming before God, this is really the key difference. Are we going to be humble or selfish? When we face a trial? Is it all about us? Or do we take a step back and consider what God is doing on a broader scale, or what God has provided for us on a broader scale, or what maybe this challenge in our life will ultimately do?

Jeremy Sweets  25:49
We can come out on top on trial sometimes by injury, God may bring us to a situation that provides even more than we imagined, if we will don't endure that trial with trust in Him. But that requires that we would have humble hearts, humble hearts. Another way we might look at this humility rather than selfishness another side of the coin is trust versus self sufficiency. The Israelites needed to trust in God, not themselves, they needed to humble themselves and trust in God. You know, we don't have time to look at a very important passage in Matthew chapter four. And look at all the things that happen there, Jesus had his own wilderness experience. And instead of being self sufficient, and trying to do things apart from God, his father, he reacted with trust, time and time again, he quoted Scripture to Satan, and he relied upon God. He said, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God. And that's the lesson we need to hear. We may be hungry for bread in the wilderness. But there is more to this life and filling our stomachs. We need to live upon God in His Word, and trust him. Let me add some sobering reminders. As we conclude, I talked about the Israelites what they did and what we should do in light of our time in the wilderness, but consider what God has done. God tests us in our difficulties and challenges. Sometimes we're only thinking about what we want are our difficult circumstances. But the text says that God test the people. It says it on two separate occasions that God had tested them. We see in Exodus 20, or 15, in verse 25. There it says, Then the Lord made for them a statute and a rule and there he tested them, says, if you will obey me and follow after my law, then I will not bring upon you the plagues that I brought upon Egypt, you will not experience those same things, even though they were hungry, and God would provide for them. He says, If you will follow after me, then I will not bring upon you the play eggs. In essence, they were being tested by God, how they would react, God was watching how they react, and as norm brought up and or suffer talk, others are watching how we will act and how we will live. It may be that this is a test. So how will we How will we approach the test? How will we do on the test? Will we fail or where we pass? Well, we act with a grateful heart or an ungrateful hearts. To me that's sobering to realize that my challenges may be a testing for me, it may be testing the mettle of my heart. And so we need to consider that. Another sobering reminder is that God hears our grumbling. When the Israelites cried out at the end of chapter two in their slavery, God heard them. God heard their pain and that's comforting, isn't it? To know that we can cry out to God and God will hear us. But it's very sobering to understand that God also hears our complaints. God hears our grumbling. In Exodus, chapter 16, verse eight, Moses stated that the Lord has heard your grumbling and that you grumble against him. They may have thought that they were only grumbling against Moses, wait a minute, we weren't grumbling against God. In chapter 16, verse 12, God would say, I've heard your grumbling. I've heard your grumbling. And then chapter 16, verse eight, Moses finishes that statement by saying your grumbling is not against us but against the Lord. When we complain, we may not be intending to do That toward God, we may not be trying to complain against God, but we are. When we grumbling complain, we're accusing God, the great provider of not providing for us. And God hears this. God hears every word we utter. And it's sobering to recognize that God hears even our grumbling, maybe that will make us think twice, before grumbling and complaining. And God provides for his people.

Jeremy Sweets  30:32
In the midst of their grumbling each time after they grumbled God would provide for them. They didn't allow, really God the time to give them what they needed. They wanted what they wanted, and they wanted it now. And that's often how ungrateful hearts act, there's a demand. There's a selfish interest, there's a requiring I need what I want right now. But if we will wait for God, often God will provide the very thing that we were upset about. Now, that doesn't always happen. We don't always get everything we want. God our Father in His wisdom does not give us our heart's desire, but he does what is best. But it may be that our grumbling and complaining was for not because God will give us what is good for us and what we need. God has always provided for his people. That's very clear throughout Exodus and numbers, it's very clear that God provides for the things of nature, the lilies of the field, the birds of the air. And it should be very clear to us that God provides for us today, as well. God is a good God, he has always provided for his people. The greatest provision that God has provided is not food and water, though. It is His Son, Jesus Christ, who got on the cross for our sins. Maybe you're here this morning and you're not a Christian. You've not obeyed the gospel message. God's provision of his son means that we can hear the gospel message the good news believe that Jesus is the Christ, repent of our sins and be baptized into Christ for the forgiveness of our sins. what a what a great blessing that is that we can be called the children of God. Maybe you're here this morning and you are a Christian, you're not living as you should. You have an opportunity to make your life right to amend your way your your your path, to honor your commitment to serve Jesus all the days of your life. There's anyone subject to the invitation, please come as we stand in scene at this time.
