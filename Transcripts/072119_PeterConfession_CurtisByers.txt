Good evening, if you would open your Bibles to Matthew the chapter 16. Matthew 16. Let me get reading there in verse 13. The passage is well known to us I'm sure we've read many times. Can we just go and think about what this speak on an eye, this passage just kind of caught my interest and intrigue me. And I just thought we would use it as the basis of our study this evening. Matthew chapter 16, beginning with verse 13. Let's begin reading please. When Jesus came into the district assessories of Philippi, he asked his disciples, Who do people say that the Son of Man is, and they said, Some say John the Baptist, others say Elijah and others, Jeremiah are one of the prophets. He said to them, But who do you say that I am? Simon Peter replied, You are the Christ, the Son of the living God. And Jesus answered him, bless it, are you Simon bar Jonah, for flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but my Father who is in heaven, and I tell you, your Peter, that on this rock, I will build my church, and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven. And whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven. And whatever you loose on earth, shall be loosed in heaven, then you strictly charge the disciples to tell no one that he was the Christ. There are three things in this passage, I want us to look at the night, there's many things we can look at, we'll touch on many. But I like to focus on the three titles that are used for Jesus in this passage, Son of man, the Christ and the Son of the living God, we'll look at that. Also like to look at verse 18, where Jesus says, I tell you that you are Peter on this rock, I will build my church. And then also, we'll look at verse 19, where Jesus gives the keys of the kingdom to to Peter, is interesting if you compare it with Matthew's account with the parallel accounts, and Mark and loot, the passages that I have highlighted here, and if you can see that other passage I have highlighted, that's the part that's unique to Matthew, the part in black that the sections in black are common to both are all three, Matthew, Mark, and Luke. So the points of emphasis that would make our own study the night are only only found in Matthew's account, those use in Plymouth areas first. The Gospel of Matthew has a couple of different organizational schemes. One is clear that Matthew uses five discourses to kind of give some structure to his gospel. Each one of these sections of teachings is terminates with a with the same formula when Jesus finished the same, so it's clear that Matthew intentionally group the teachings of Jesus into these five different lumps of material for whatever for whatever purpose son, of course, think that he's trying to show Jesus as as new Moses that this is the new Pentateuch. Like the Five Books of Moses, you have the five discourses of Jesus, hey, between these discourses are narrative sections where Jesus is traveling about doing wondrous deeds. This confession, the section that we've just read in Matthew 16, falls between the third and fourth discourse.

Curtis Byers  03:47
Now, there's another way that Matthew also gives us a clue how he organizes his gospels as another formula that occurs at chapter four, and then immediately after this section in chapter 16, and that's the, that's the formula. From that time Jesus began to Chapter Four following what we have recorded in Matthew's Gospel is what we call the Galilean ministry. Now, Galilee was that northern section of Palestine? That's where Nazareth was in Canaan, in the Sea of Galilee, all those areas that we read about in the UN during the ministry of Jesus. So the first half the book was to say the first section the book deals with a galleon ministry, then medially, after this confession, we see this formula again, From that time Jesus began to and from that point on, we read of Jesus journey to Jerusalem, if I want to read that passage, that's a passage unfold. Matthew 1621. The text says, From that time, Jesus began to show his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem and suffer many things from the elders and the chief priests and the scribes and be killed. And on the third De be raised. This is the first time that Jesus tells His disciples that He is going to have to be killed. He's going to tell them that several times as he journeys to Jerusalem, but the very first time he tells me that that follows immediately after this confession that Peter makes concerning Jesus Christ. Now if we go to the text at the beginning of our reading in first 13 It says that when Jesus came into the district assessories Philippon, there are two sets of areas in in the Galilee area seseri of Philippi, was at the very northern limits, because right there next to Dan, you'll remember the Old Testament Dan was the northern Morse most city of the children of Israel. And that's where assessor Rhea Philippi, has been that very same facility. That's the outer limits of the Jewish holding. Now accessory of Philippi, though, was a Gentile city, I suspect there were Jews who lived there. But you notice that it does not say that Jesus went intercessory of Philippi, but rather he went into the district of stessa. Ria. Philippon, there were several Gentile towns throughout Galilee. We might not realize that but there were several cities such as sub forests, Tiberius, and then of course, the assessor area by the sea. All those were Gentile towns. You know, Israel was an occupied country nation. So Jesus tended to avoid those areas. But in this case, he's gone. He's he's worked his way throughout the Galilean ministry, he's come to the end of the Galilean ministry. And he's up there at the very northern part of Israel. And as at that point in time, when he asked this question of his disciples, you know, who didn't? Who do people say that the Son of Man is, and they give a response. They say, some say John, the badness, some say, Elijah, others, Jeremiah, or one of the prophets. We had read earlier in an earlier instance, in Mark's account, no, we have not read that. But if you had read the Gospels in sequence, you will have already read this statement over mark to six chapter and verse 1415. This was immediately after John the Baptist was killed by Herot. It says, king here heard of it talking about Jesus, for Jesus name had become known, some said, John the Baptist has been raised in the dead, that is why these miraculous powers are working him but other says he has Elijah and other says, he is a prophet, like one of the prophets, of old. All four of these that are mentioned were prophets. And that was be a true statement concerning Jesus, Jesus was a prophet, but he was more than a prophet. The one that's in this list, and Matthews account that was not in that earlier list is Jeremiah. And we don't know exactly why Jeremiah made the list. There was and there was one intertestamental writing of the Jewish people that talked about that Isaiah and Jeremiah would return. And so there may have been some kind of speculation among the people, that Jeremiah, like Elijah was supposed to come back before the Messiah would come. So perhaps, that was the thought. Clearly, though, what's missing from this list? What's missing from this list is that they do not say that he is the Messiah. They believe that these he may be one of the forerunners to the Messiah, but not the Messiah himself.

Curtis Byers  08:44
Jesus then ask, Well, who do you see you say that I am. And as at this point of Simon Peter speaks up, being usually the first to take the initiative for some like this. And he says, You are the Christ, the son of a living God. So we have these three titles for Jesus that are used in this account. And to my best of my knowledge, I didn't do an exhaustive search. But I do not know these three titles being used in the same context, any other gospel account, but I may be wrong about that. But I want to take this moment and think about these three titles because I think I have had some impressions about these that are maybe not necessarily true. I think maybe we need to clarify our thinking is what these titles refer to. First, the Son of Man. Now the Son of Man is simply an idiom, in Hebrew language and Aramaic. It was just another way of saying, Man, right? If they were to tell a story about a man went out and did this, they might say, a son of man went out and did this. And an Old Testament port resections you'll remember that the sometimes the term son a man is used the Psalms eight for example. What is man, dog man? What is Manda, you know, there are Mossville of him or son of man that cares for him. There you got the term man and the term Son of Man us in opposition to each other, clearly referring to the same person simply just means man. And if you look at the relative frequency of this terms throughout the Gospels is fairly uniform in all four Gospels from beginning to end, throughout the entire ministry of Jesus. This term is used frequently by Jesus. Now, it's twice as frequent in Matthew, as is John. But still those same order of magnitude is used a lot throughout the entire Gospel accounts, is only used by Jesus. No one else calls Jesus the Son of Man, only Jesus calls himself the Son of Man. So you might ask, what is it about this term that Jesus? Why did Jesus select this term to refer to himself and throughout his entire ministry, some have suggested was that clearly Jesus is trying to emphasize his humanity, and perhaps even his meekness and humility. And that certainly could be true, Jesus was meek and humble. He clearly was a man's in, in a sense, like we, and that was important for his ministry. But if you look at the if you look at the times in various contexts, when this term Son of Man is used, there's three or four areas that are usually under discussion, when the term is used, either sayings that had to do with this authority, or sayings that had to do with his suffering, and his coming vindication or his exalt exaltation, or sayings, where it talks about that he is the Son of Man is going to bring judgment. Now, those those areas pretty well span the entire, his entire scope of his teaching. So that shouldn't be too surprising. But notice, you know, especially not emphasizing his humility so much. When Jesus said, for example, to the to the lame man, that you know that the Son of Man has power on earth to forgive sins rise, take a bigger, better walk. Clearly, Jesus was saying that he is something more than a man when he can say your sins are forgiven. Or there are many times in the in some of these judgment passages where it talks about the sudden man will come in judgment. But clearly, that's not referring to just his humanity. So there's something else I think that is at stake here, when he's talking about his term, this term Son of Man. And most people would point to, and I have no reason to doubt that this may be very well the case, the dangle seven passage where we read of Daniel speaking about one like the Son of Man. And in that past, he said, you know, talks about this man who's one, this one who's like the Son of Man, he's gonna go and receive a kingdom. And that passage in the Jewish mind had been coming Come associated with the Messiah. So it could very well be that Jesus, in adopting this term Son of Man was wanting to point people to the pastiche and Daniel seven, which would point them to the fact that he was going to be the Messiah. So it'd be an indirect way, perhaps, of pointing to himself as the Messiah who was promised a comb. And that probably is the case.

Curtis Byers  13:35
The term Son of God is a term that we often will associate with Jesus. And I think when we think of that term, we obviously think of Jesus divinity. But that was not the way that the term was thought of, in the, you know, the biblical times. Kings were called the sons of God. Israel was called the Son of God, angels were called the Son of God, Adam was called the Son of God, peacemakers Christians are all called sons of God. It was simply a term signifying of relationship between the father and this children. Right. Now, Jesus, clearly though, became the Son. And he pointed to passages like, are the passages like second single seven, or Psalm two which speaks of the Son of God, again, point of four to a Messiah. And so just like those other passages, Jesus fulfilled this idea of Son of God in a way far beyond what they would have ever imagined. And Jesus was the son of the Gospel of John. John often just refers to Jesus as the son of course. In one passage, Romans one four, where Paul says that Jesus was declared to be the Son of God in power by the resurrection of the dead. So anyway, again, Jesus took a term that was already in use, and gave it a meaning beyond what it people that day and time understood it. As so even with the term Christ, the Christ was a ganas, simply those Greek equivalent of the Old Testament were Messiah, which simply means anointed. And in the Old Testament, you had many people who are known, and particularly the kings, and the priest. Even Cyrus was said to be the Lord's anointed, because he had a special task for Cyrus to do. And the Messiah was in particular associated with the son of David. So the, the expectation of the time was that the Messiah, a son of David, would come and be a deliverer in the same sense that David was. So Jesus avoids this term Messiah. He adopts the title Son of God, the Son of Man, others besides, Peter had referred to him earlier in his ministry of Son of God. But in all three instances, and all three instances, you had titles, which people have some understanding of, they use it in a certain way. But Jesus came and gave a fuller explanation. And then the question we might ask ourselves, well, when Peter answered the question that Jesus asked, Who do you say that I am? And he replied, But you are the crisis unliving God, you know, how much did Peter really understand? And his answer? We go on reading and says, Jesus says, Blessed are you, Simon, bar Jonah, for flesh, and blood has not revealed this to you, but the Father in Heaven has told you this has revealed this to you. It could be that Peter had very little understanding of what he was saying. It could be that he is simply speaking that wish was revealed to him. It could be that he had some understanding, maybe even a great understanding. But as we go through our lesson, and I think we'll see that Peter still had misunderstandings concerning these terms. But in any case, once Simon gives us answered, Jesus does pronounce a blessing upon Peter. He commends him for acknowledging the truthfulness of the fact that he is the Son of God, the Christ, the Son of the living God. And that brings us then to verse 18, where Jesus says, and I tell you, you are Peter, and on this rock, I will build my church. What a pause for a moment and look at this expression. This passage has been said, by many to probably be the most debated, most controversial passage in all scripture.

Curtis Byers  18:17
Because the question in the room is raised by this what exactly you notice Jesus saying, concerning Peter, he says, You are Peter, and on this rock, I will build my church. Now there's a there's a wordplay going on in their original that we don't see in our English translation, you're probably familiar with the fact that the term rock and the term Peter are related wasn't a masculine, it was a masculine term and the other was a feminine term Greek as a gendered language. And so nouns and such are given gender. But these are both from the same root word. And they both basically have the meaning of rock. Some translations, some of them are the newer more translations I tried to give them meaning more so the form will try to reflect this revised English Bible for example, says you are Peter the rock, the rocks, not in the tax, but they add that to make it clear to try to give that sands are the New Living Translation will be put in parentheses at First Peter says, which means rock. Right? So the question though, is, what does it mean that when Jesus says you are rock, and on this rock, I will build my church? We believe that Jesus would have spoke Aramaic. We don't know that for a fact. Jesus clearly would have known Greek and there's no question about that. But it is usually uniformly believing that Jesus would have spoke Aramaic, even in this, this passage before us. Notice he called him Simon bar Jonah. Bar. Jonah is an Aramaic expression, an idea of flesh and blood was an Arab may idiom. So it seems to be the case even in this passage that Jesus was probably speaking Aramaic. Now, whereas in the Greek, you had the two different words that were being used, both having the meaning of rock, but two different words, and they were different words, because you had a difference of gender, and air make, there is no difference in gender. The term rock is already a masculine term. So most people would think most people say they believe that if Jesus had been speaking in Aramaic, he would have said, You are Keepa. And on this key fob, I will build my church. Now we know that's almost certainly the case with regard to Peters name, because how else is Peter referred to in Scripture? Please refer to the sequence. Right. CFS is simply the Greek transliteration of the Aramaic Keifa. So we know that's pretty well, certain. That's what he would have said with regard to Peter. But people are so sure about that with regard to the second term. There were other words and Aramaic that also had the meaning of rock. So a son was say, Well, if Peter, or if you have Matthew recorded it using two different terms, then Jesus must have used two different terms as well. And when he spoke Aramaic, or else, Matthew would not have been a very faithful recorder of what transpired. I don't know about that. I mean, I don't understand I don't understand about that. That's above my paygrade. But it still is just all this kind of just still kind of raises the tension. You know, what is Jesus trying to say, when he says that you are rocking on this rock, I will build my church. Well, there are three views that have been put forward throughout time and others, but the three main views are these. The first one is that the rock is actual Peter, that what Jesus is saying, You are rock, and on this rock on you, Peter, I will build my church. Now all three of these views go back to the early centuries, you can find all three of these views being tested back into the say, the third century of Africa for Christ.

Curtis Byers  22:47
This particular view, this first view, became more prominent as time progressed, and the Roman Bishop, the bishop of Rome, was trying to secure more and more power for himself over the all the churches universally. So with the growth of the QAT Roman Catholic Church, you had a body of opinion being expressed, that the rock in this particular passage on which Jesus built his church was Peter. Now going along with that there's a lot of other teachings regarding the the papacy, besides the fact that Peter would have been the rock in which Jesus built his church, for example. For the, for the Roman Pope, teaching to have any teeth, you would have to be able to show, for example, that Peter was the first bishop of Rome, maybe even that Peter founded the church of Rome. And if he didn't found at least he was the first bishop of Rome. Well, there's there's no way that can be documented. There's no There's no records whatsoever, anywhere that can demonstrate it confidently, that Peter was the first bishop of Rome. You also have to have the ideal successors, right? Peter is going to die. And so for the pope concept to continue there is going to have to be succeeding Pope's who have the same authority of Peter, this passage says nothing about this. This passage cannot bear the weight of all the teachings surrounding the Pope and the Roman Catholic Church. But anyway, that was the kind of the kind of the first view that people that was presented in the face or support of the of the papacy. For the Reformation happened, and this 1500s And men like Calvin and Zwingli, they protested against the understanding of Peter being the Pope. And they said they thought it was the computers confession was either the rock or perhaps Jesus Christ Himself was the rock of which the church was built. Whether they thought that was, what the passage actually sad, or a vessel be they took that view to counter that, you know, the view of the Roman Catholic Church. I'm not really certain. But the question, you know, the question before us is, you know, what is what is? What is Matthew trying to tell us? And more particularly, what is Jesus trying to tell us when he says, that you're Peter on this rock, I will build my church? I don't know the answer. And part of the reason I don't know the answer, I don't know if anybody knows the answer. Because I have studied this enough to know that you'll find competent scholars who do not seem to be have a bias involved, who take both sides of this question, whether or not Peter was a rock, or whether the confession of Peters or the Jesus Christ was the rock. You know, I said that this was the most one of the most debated passages in all scripture. Well, the truth of the matter is, that really isn't the case any longer that once upon a time was the case. But a funny thing has happened over the past 50 to 100 years. And that is most Protestant scholars. Every Protestant scholar that I read, and that's about 15, or 20, in the past few weeks, couple weeks, every one of them takes the view that Peter is the rock. I mean, that that has become the predominant view, both of Catholics and Protestants. You know, that's surprised me to some extent, there are some brethren who still, I'm sure, in the pews and in the churches in the Protestant churches throughout, you'll find people who will still make the claim for the either the second and third. But it's clear that scholarship has gone in the direction of saying that Peter is the rock. Now there are there are some very good there are those some very good Greek scholars who will challenge that? And they may very well be right. They may very well be right, I honestly just don't know. I do know a couple things, I believe that I have learned and that I think are bad ways to try to argue against that first view. So I do want to share that with you.

Curtis Byers  27:34
You know, I can remember hearing lessons on this, my entire life growing up you, you'll hear lessons on this passage a whole lot anymore. And I remember vividly the distinction that was made between Petrus and Petra. And argument was that Petroff means a small stone, and Petra ah means bedrock. And so therefore says we have two different types of rock being described. Think clearly Peter could not be the rock that Jesus is referring to, when he says upon this rock, I will build my church because you can't build a building upon a small stone that makes sense. Well universally, who was a universally That means everybody I have checked, and again, I've checked dozens of references on this in the past couple weeks. Everybody I've checked, says that distinction cannot be maintained, that distinction cannot be maintained. Now 4050 years ago, when I was hearing those lessons, probably people could make that distinction, some of the great works available, would have made that distinction. And they probably thought that that was accurate distinction to be made. But in the past, you know, with the computers, there are now electronic databases of all these ancient writings that scholars can search at will. You don't have to read ever Greek writing to come across every time petrol or petrol is used, you can do a search on that. And the conclusion of those who have done those kinds of searches is that these are words are interchangeable. There are times when Petroff is referred to a small telescope, but there are times when Petra refers to a small stone and vice versa. They are interchangeable. You know, there are so many semantic range is exactly the same. There is no difference in those two terms. So yeah. Could there still be something like that going on? Yes, it could be. But the point is, we really just can't say on the basis of how is on the basis of how it was used. The only argument that people make about this is that they say okay, let's compare the first Corinthians 311 passage. You know there. Paul right to the Corinthians says that, you know, there's no other foundation and that was can be we laid wishes Jesus Christ our Lord. So that was the argument would be simple, simple way like this. Well, Paul says that the foundation is Jesus Christ. So clearly therefore, when Jesus was speaking here in Matthew chapter 16, he must met exactly the same thing. And so the foundation, the rock of when is this is built would be the third view. The third view being that Jesus Christ Himself is the rock. Because after all, we have to have, you know, Scripture agreeing with scripture. Well, yes, Scripture does have to agree with scripture. I agree with that. But, but there is also remember the Ephesians two passage, which says, again, is Paul, the same author who wrote First Corinthians said, talked about the household of God that was built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus Himself being the cornerstone. So it is true that Jesus is the foundation. It is also true that the apostles and the prophets are part of the foundation with Jesus Christ being the chief cornerstone. Could it be true, that Peter Assam says, could have been said to have been the foundation in this passage over Mark 16? Matthew 16, it wouldn't be out of line with that passage there in Ephesians, the second chapter, would it be in strictly aligned with it? The thing we got to remember about metaphors, you know, you metaphors take on their meaning based on the context in which they are used. And you can't take the meaning in one context and apply it to the meaning and another context.

Curtis Byers  31:51
Peter and me, excuse me, Paul, in First Corinthians three, and that context, he's talks about Jesus Christ being the foundation, that's the only foundation in the view. And his teaching there First Corinthians three, nobody seems to be to the Ephesians there in Ephesians, two, he was talking about something he was making a different point. He used the same metaphor of a foundation, but he was using it a different way. And that passage, he had no problem having the apostles and prophets share in being the foundation that Jesus Christ, of course, he still gives Christ the preeminence is called him a chief cornerstone. So could it not be that the term metaphor the foundation metaphor has been used by Jesus in a different way over Matthew 16, and couldn't not be in some sense that Peter is, again, some kind of some kind of special role in Jesus building the church? So I guess, I guess my, my thought would be, I don't know that we gain anything by trying to minimize what is said concerning Peter, the teaching of the Roman Catholicism regarding the papacy is not being taught in this passage. Maybe you can't get it all what they say in this passage. And most what you can get out of this passage is that Jesus is given some special commendation that Jesus is rather a Peter has been given some special commendation by Jesus, or some special role by Jesus. And isn't that really exactly what we see? And as the gospel is, preached out the world, it acts chapter one, it was Peter, who took the lead in finding a replacement for Judas. And chapters two and three, it is Peter's sermon that is recorded for us. In fact, when maybe in chapter two, he's the only one that's preaching is hard to know. But as his sermon is recorded, it acts chapter four, it has Peters reply, not Jaws as Peters, who's the one who replies to the Sanhedrin, as they were challenging them for their teaching. In chapter five, it was Peter, who calls it an awesome so far on the carpet, and the Lord kills them as a result of their deception. And again, of course, last but not least, was Peter, who preached the gospel first to the Gentiles. Peter clearly had a pivotal, foundational, introductory role in the proclamation of the gospel. And that may all that being said there in that passage, when Jesus says, You are Peter, on this rock, I will build my church is significant. I guess my point is, is hard to argue, on the basis of the language is hard to do whether what the correct view is you're going to have to answer it on the basis of simply the context was told to us a little seeing anything in the context that would challenge that is a possibility. I'll give you one other possibility, though, that that a read. Alfred Edgar Schein was in was a Jew who became a Christian. He lived back in the 1800s. He was, uh, he wrote a book called The Life and Times of Jesus Messiah has been a standard book that's been available for years. It's one of those books that everybody has nobody reads. I mean, because, you know, it's a big tome. And as you know, 150 160 years old, so who wants to read that anyway? I've always found if you take the time to read him, he's he's well worth the time. And he but he made this observation concerning this passage. He says, you know, he takes the view that Peter that Jesus is renaming Peter on this occasion. We don't know exactly when Peter was called Peter, we know that was a nickname that Jesus gave to him. This is the first time that Peter has ever called Peter though, in the Gospel account. Matthew, as the narrator uses the term Peter throughout the ministry, but this is the first time when Peters addressing is called a name Peter. And he makes it he makes this parallel. He says, when Abraham was given a special role, a task when God decided to make for himself with people. What did he do, he changed the name of Abraham, Abraham. And then when Jesus, or God selected Jacob, among the two, and gave him the special role of being the head of his people, he again changed his name from Jacob, Israel. And it says in some way, he, he seems to him, that the renaming of Peter on this occasion, and Jesus immediately following that up with the statement, I will build my church and the church is simply the name for the community of God's people.

Curtis Byers  36:52
That he thinks in some way or another that the renaming of Peter has to as a kind of a signal, a flag for us to understand that God is making himself a new people, the church and that Peter is going to have a, you know, a role to play in that formation of this new people. And that's, you know, quite honest, that seems to be pretty reasonable. Now, what, what I found interesting is this. There have been some modern scholars who have who have noticed that same thing. But they act as if this is a new thought. They they don't give Edgar Schein any credit for it. They act as if it's something new that they thought of. So now a lot of people are kind of making that comparison. But Edgar Schein made it long ago. Anyway, that's the thought, right? Now, here's another dilemma because we're not through with our passage yet. Even if we were in some sense or another able to show that Peter is not giving any kind of prominence in this verse here, verse 18, he's still got verse 19, to deal with. Okay, but we're not quite there. So let's, let's first look at the next statement. And that next statement is the gates of hell shall not prevail against Jesus that He will build his church and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. The word hail there is the word Hades. And every other time English Standard Version translates word Hades they translated as Hades. This was transliteration. Only in this instance, do they use the word hail as a translation? That's odd. All modern translations have just simply got most all modern translations, except for a couple have simply gone to use the word Hades. The King James Version, we use the word hail but the King James didn't. The King James Version did not make a distinction between Hades and get henna. Hades is the realm of the dead Gahanna as the final place of the those in torment, right. So the question is, what is when Jesus said with the gates of hell or the gates of Hades? What is he referring to? Well, if you keep the word Hades, if you keep the word Hades in mind, that in most logically will make you think of this realm of the dead. And the gays are those gays that keep the dead in their plates. And so Jesus is saying that I'm going to build my church and the power of death, the gates of Hades will not prevail. Well, the meaning of that seems to be pretty clear to me. What do you think Jesus is Jesus is not going to be thought of and his are defeated in his efforts because he He's going to be kept in the Hadean world. No Jesus, after the third day rose from the dead, he broke the gates of Hades, he came back from the dead he was raised. So Hades is not going to win, Jesus is going to win. And that seems to be the clear understanding. If you were to use the word Hadees, which is what the word is. There is another opinion, though. And I think that's why these, these translators use the word hail because they believe this other to be the case. They simply believe that it's talking about the forces of evil here. And we're talking about the forces of Satan, and how that Satan over histories is going to attack the church, and even today is continuing to attack the church. And that the that Satan and his forces will not be successful, now or in the future, and attacking the church. You know, Christ Church will prevail. That certainly could be the case. But you'd be just hard to get that out of the word Hades. So it'd be used the word hell, you may make it make it a little easier to make that argument, not as easy to make it by using the word Hadees. I'm disappointed the ESB quite honestly, it seems like leave the interpretation up to the interpreter. Don't change the text, simply to fit your interpretation. But let's let's pass on from that. I mean, then we come to this last statement in verse 19. I will give you the keys to the kingdom of heaven, whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven, whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.

Curtis Byers  41:36
So even if even if we have, even if you can determine somehow or another, that Peter wasn't the rock, and that Peter had no special role, or given no special place, and Jesus statement earlier, you still have this statement, which says that Jesus will give to Peter, the keys of the kingdom of heaven. And whatever you bind to Earth will be unbound in him, when shall we shall be loosed in heaven? That is a pretty powerful statement in of itself. So how does it How does one deal with this? Well, they bear the keys is usually the steward, the chief steward, okay, in a household or in a kingdom, the one who bore the keys would have been the chief steward. And that keys was a symbol of their authority, as well as physically giving them the access to the various places within the kingdom, right. Again, this passage seems to be given unto Peter, some sort of position of prominence, because he is the one that's going to be given the keys of the kingdom. Now, I believe that to be given the keys to the kingdom means exactly what it says in the second part of this verse. And that is that you have that whatever you bind, will have will be bound and whatever you lose, will be loosed. So I think I take the first part of the verse and the second part of the verse to be equivalent. Well, the second part of that verse may come back to that minute, the second part of that verse occurs over Matthew 18, the exact same word in a different context where it talks about, I say to you, whatever you buy, an earth shall be banned, and whatever you loose on earth should be loose. That same wording is used a couple chapters later, to refer, at least to all the apostles. Some brethren even think it refers to all Christians of all time. That seems a little broad to me, but at least we would agree that it would be fair to all the apostles. So. So in some sense, we would have to understand that Peter is not being singled out, particularly, because after all, all the apostles are going to be given the same authority. So Peter might be simply being singled out as some sort of representative of all the apostles. But in any case, the dilemma here that the challenge here for us is trying to understand what Jesus is saying is this expression shall be bound and shall be loosed. I'm sure you're, you know, you're aware of the differences of translations, or there's two or three translations that translate this instead of shall be bound with translated shall have been bound, instead of its translated shall be loose, will translate it shall have been loose. And the concern is with a with a first with a way that a reason in the English Standard and most in most other translation, the concern is a sales as the 1000. If that whatever Peter or whatever Peter, the apostles decide, then the Lord is just going to sanction it in heaven. Right? Peter Parcells, you decide what is to be bound and loose. And the Lord Jesus is saying that there will just will second that make it so in heaven, whatever you decide on Earth, that's the concern with this passage. So there's, you know, clearly I think that's a false understanding. And one way around that if if the passage truly does say, if if the language can truly be understood and say that whatever you bind an earth shall have been bound in heaven and whatever you loose on earth shall have been loosed in heaven, then you get to get away from that problem, right? Because in that instance, Peter and the other parcels will only be binding those things that the Lord had already bound. But again, the dilemma, how do you decide which of these two translations are correct? I again, I don't know. I'm getting this above my paygrade. But again, I do know that there are good scholars on both sides of this question. Good scholars on both sides this question. And I would rather than say is, do we have Is it is it as intractable as it appears? Could there might be some other way of understanding this, that might be helpful, that may avoid the problem altogether? Well, a couple a couple of thoughts, for you to think about. It seems to be when I look at this expression, the thing that I would like someone to explain, what does it mean, exactly, to bind or lose something in heaven? I've read tons on this, and no one discusses that part of it.

Curtis Byers  46:30
It seems as if everybody assumes that something that is bound or loosed in heaven means that that becomes the will of God. If something is bound in heaven or loose in heaven, then that means that simply God is taking that on as part of his will. His his desire His intent? And I don't, I don't know that that's true at all. You know, could it be that the will of God, God's will, is something different than this ideal of binding and loosing in heaven? Certainly, there's other possibilities out there, what that could mean. And if you break that connection, then there's really no problem in this passage whatsoever. Take Take the SEC, take the second understanding for me and take this case, where shall have been bound and loose? Let me slow down for a minute, make sure I try to make this clear. Even that view requires some other understanding. If I were to tell you, Okay, parcels, whatever you bind on earth, shall have already been bound in heaven. What does that require? What else must be true for that statement to be a true statement? Well, it must be true that God has a will concerning the matter, that he has revealed that we'll to the apostles, and apostles have been faithful to the will of the Lord, and have done exactly what the Lord asked him to do. Right? Does that make sense? I mean, even a second understanding demands, that the apostles are simply acting in accordance with the will of God. If you break the connection between God's will and the binding or loosening heaven, then if you take the first view, you can make the exact same assumption and it'd be fine. And whatever you bind on earth, Peter, whatever you bind on earth apostles, you know, things that you have been told by God and His will and you bind those things that he is told in his will are true, and you've been faithful and you bound them, then I will see to it that those things are bound in heaven as well. Right? There's no problem with that, right? That would be equally permissible. And again, this avoids the problem altogether, if you simply break the connection between the will of God and this phrase, whatever you bind on earth, or whatever is bound in heaven, or loosed in heaven. I don't know if I explained that well, but I hope I've explained it well enough to get a sense there. So again, I don't worry too much about this, I think we clearly believe that all the apostles would have had to be faithful stewards of the messages that were given to them. And then even Peter as he was given this primary role to preach the gospel in the early chapters of Acts. He was simply doing the things that he was been revealed to him. And even in this passage, he made a confession that he made because Jesus said it had been revealed to him and Peter was simply being faithful to that revelation. So for your thoughts. I want to just finish with a reading this next section in our text, Matthew 16. I'm sorry, I'm last too long and I apologize. But in verse 21, Read with me just three verses. From that time Jesus began to show his disciples that he must go to Jerusalem suffer many things from elders and chief priests and scribes be killed on the third day be raised. We said, that's the first time that Jesus made this pronouncement. And it falls immediately after this confession. But notice verse 22. And Peter took Him aside and began to rebuke Him, saying, Far be it from you, Lord, this will never happen to you. Now go back, let me ask the question I asked earlier, did Peter really understand? When he's called Jesus, the Son of God? Did he really understand that in its fullest sense? If he did, can you imagine someone rebuking God to the face? I don't think so. I think Peter didn't really understand what he was saying, fully, but never 23. But he that is Jesus turned and said to Peter, Get behind Me, Satan, you're a hindrance to me for you're not setting your mind on the things of God, but on things of man. At the very point in time that Peter is commended by the Lord. At that very instant, he is also reprimanded by the Lord. A few moments changed a lot there for Peter. And I guess the lesson of a lesson I will leave as we turn quit tonight is simply that

Curtis Byers  51:32
we can be faithful to God, one moment, business surprising how that we can turn around the very next moment, and not be faithful to God, that we can actually be found to work against God. And so that, so that's a warning to all of us. Let's, let's study the Scriptures. Let's understand that in them is truth. There are there are many passages in scripture that we just do not understand, and probably will never understand. And I think that's because of our lack of knowledge. Our ignorance are the limitations of our time in place, not because not only failing is on the part of the God who revealed it. But as we but we will learn enough to know what God wills for us to do to be as acceptable servants of him. So if there's deny, as we conclude, I would offer the Lord's invitation. The call for you to confess his name, just as Peter confessed his name to accept Him as the Messiah, the Son of living God, put your hope and confidence in Him and you will never be disappointed. For the Lord is always faithful. There's any subject to the invitation we urge you to commencement standing soon
