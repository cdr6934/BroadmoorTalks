to put ourselves so to speak in Kane's position as if God were speaking to each one of us, what would he say to you and I as we face these different challenges, and think about a conversation that God has with Cain, so read with me in Genesis four beginning in verse one. It says, Now Adam, and now Adam knew Eve his wife, and she conceived and bore Cain and said, I have acquired a man from the Lord. Then she bore again this time, his brother, Abel. Now Abel was a keeper of sheep, but Cain was a tiller of the ground. And in the process of time, it came to pass that Cain brought an offering of the fruit of the ground to the Lord. Abel also brought of the firstborn of his flock and of their fat, and the Lord respected Abel and his offering, but he did not respect Cain and his offering. And Cain was very angry, and his countenance fell. So the Lord said to Cain, why are you angry? And why is your countenance fallen? If you do, well, will you not be accepted. And if you do not do well, sin lies at the door, and its desire is for you. But you should rule over it.

Conrad Harkrider  01:22
At the end of Genesis, chapter three, we're told that Adam and Eve were required to leave the garden after eating of the tree, that special relationship was broken with God. And so he put them out of the midst of the garden, and life may have seemed like it was coming to an end. But here we see in chapter four, that life does actually go on. Now they are starting their family, they're having children, but the reality of living in a world with sin would be a very dark reality is what we see here in Genesis four. Notice in verse one, it says, Eve, after she conceives and bears a son, she says, I have gotten or acquired a man from the Lord Keynes name literally means to acquire, or to possess. And so maybe Eve is thinking about what she has acquired or what she now possesses. Maybe she was thinking back to the curse that God had made in the garden, to the serpent, when he said that he would put enmity or space between the serpent seed and the woman's seed. And then he said that the woman's seed would one day bruise or crush the head of the serpent. And so perhaps Eve is thinking here is this child that I have received, maybe he will be the one that will ultimately deliver us from the curse of sin, such great hope and optimism with this child. In verse two, it says that she bore again Abel, his brother, and now we have the first family, two boys living on the earth, were immediately told about their occupations, which will play a role into the types of offerings and sacrifice that they bring to God later on. Abel is a keeper of the sheep. Now, this time, they weren't eating any type of meat. That doesn't happen until after the flood in Genesis chapter nine. But keeping sheep would have been a good idea as you don't have to kill them in order to take the wool and to make clothing that use or need for clothes was required because of the consequences of sin. So Abel is a keeper of sheep. Cain is a tiller of the ground, no longer in the paradise of God. Cain has to work until the earth after Adam ate from the trees, God's curse or punishment to him was that the ground was going to produce thorns, and that it would be very difficult for him by the sweat of his face, he would be able to bring forth produce from the earth. And so now his son is suffering, the consequences of that working the ground. In verse three, it says that in the process of time, they each brought an offering to the Lord. Okay, and I suppose, brought some of the produce from the ground because that was his line of work. That's what he had access to. Abel brings one of the animals from the flock. But verse four tells us that God had regard he respected April's offering but then he did not have regard for Caine's offering. Now there's been a lot of speculation about what was going on here. Why did God respect one and not the other? Why did He not except Caine's offering? Well the short answer to that is the text doesn't tell us. There's lots of things that are happening behind the scenes, when we read an account in the scriptures that we just don't have insight into. But there are possibly some possibilities for us to consider. First of all, maybe God had told them to bring a blood sacrifice. In Hebrews, chapter nine and verse 22. God says that without the shedding of blood, there is no remission of sins. Abel brings an animal Cain brings produce. So maybe that's why he was not respected. Or perhaps it was because Abel brought the firstborn from his flock and the fat portions, the firstborn was the best, the fat was the choice of of the flock, the best portion. And tech says nothing about the quality of what Cain brought, it just says that he brought some of the produce. Also, sacrificing your firstborn is a show of great commitment and faith. Because you don't know what's going to happen after that point, the animal may get sick, it may get eaten, it may die, it may not be able to have any more young and so if you give up that first born, you are in essence saying to God, I trust you, I believe that you are going to continue to bless me. And shouldn't that be our approach when we give to God, we take what we've been given what we've been blessed with financially, and then we give to the Lord. First. We we trust in God, we give Him our best our first few fruits and not what's left over at the end of the month. And so maybe this is why Abel was accepted. Another possibility is that Cain was not making his offering from the heart. In other words, he was just going through the motions, it was just doing the act, but there was no faith, there was no commitment or hearts behind his actions. In Isaiah chapter 29, though, the Lord rebukes the people, because he says that these people honor me with their lips and their mouths, and they bring their worship, but their heart is far from me. And so God has always wanted more than just the physical act. Hebrews chapter 11. And verse four talks about how Abel by faith offered a better sacrifice or a better offering, because he trusted God, he made a more sincere offering one that honored God and not himself. God has always been concerned with the heart. And yes, he asked people to come and worship Him. But behind those offerings, there should be something more a heart of gratitude, a Thanksgiving of repentance. And so yes, it's great that we come together, but deep inside of us, the worship that we offer should be flowing out from a heart of thanksgiving to the Lord. Well, whatever the reason canes offering is not accepted in verse five. Verse five tells us about his reaction. It says that he became very angry, and his countenance fell, his His face became upset, you could see the look, everyone knew that he was upset. Well, I want us to focus the rest of our time on this conversation that they have when as the Lord reaches out to Cain First of all notice in this conversation that God in fact, reaches out to Him. God is the one who initiates here. Think for just a moment about the timeline of events. First of all, God gives some type of instruction, he tells Adam and Eve are Cain and Abel about sacrifice that he wants them to make an offering.

Conrad Harkrider  09:12
They each of the boys go and make offer up a sacrifice to God. Cain is rejected, his response is to become angry and then what happens next? What might we expect to come next in the story? God comes down to Cain and rebukes him and says, stopped acting this way. God drives Cain from his presence never to offer sacrifice again. Or God just strikes Cain dead and says let's just start over with someone who is more willing to do what I've asked. No. How does God deal with an angry bitter Cain he really reaches out to him. Notice what he does in verse six. He asked the question, the Lord said to Cain, why are you angry? And why has your countenance fallen? Why are you upset? Cain? Does it surprise you that an all knowing, all powerful, God is asking a question to his creation? The One who created the universe and put everything to existence? He's asking for information, doesn't he already know why Cain is upset? We see a similar thing in the garden as God is walking in the cool of the day. And he asks the man and the woman, where are you? It's not that God didn't know where they were. It's not that God didn't understand what Cain was feeling. But instead, the question is asked not for his benefit, but for ours. Why are you angry? In other words, God wants Cain to think about his actions, and his emotions, what he's going through, and asking, Why is a powerful tool. Think about it? Have you ever stopped to just ask yourself? Why am I feeling this way? Why am I upset? Why am I jealous of this person? And oftentimes the answer as we start to work through our emotions, the answer is, can sometimes be pretty petty, about why we're feeling this way. God is a Father who is compassionate, he's patient with his children. We don't see him just bursting out flying off the handle getting upset, because one of his children has disobeyed or not offered what he required. He is a loving and gracious and compassionate God. When I was putting one of our kids to bed, and after I left the room, sounded like there was a torture going on in there, she just started screaming her head off. And so I decided to give it a few minutes, but our kids are persistent. And so it just kept going on. So finally, feeling very frustrated, I walked back upstairs, open the door, and I said, you need to go to sleep. And through the sobs, she managed to get out. You forgot to turn on the nightlight. And so I just went ahead and nominated myself for the worst dad award. So often we rush to action, before seeking to understand what's going on here. Why are they acting this way? Why are they behaving like this? Maybe the answer to those questions is that I'm not meeting their needs. I'm not paying enough attention to them, maybe I need to adjust my behavior. Because so much of what they do when they're little is a reflection on how mom and dad see the world how mom and dad are interacting. In Genesis for we see God is the perfect father, he doesn't rush to judgment or to punishment, he doesn't yell. But instead he wants what's best for his children, he reaches out. And what that says to you and me and to God's people today is that God is he's gracious. He wants us to be with him. He's not looking for us to mess up and to strike us down. But when we sin or stumble, God is still there reaching out towards us. And he pursues us. Think about all that God has done. He's made every provision for us, He who did not spare His own Son, how will he not freely give us all things? In verse seven, God asked Cain, another question.

Conrad Harkrider  14:15
He says, if you do well, will you not be accepted? That's a pretty simple formula. Do well and be accepted. Every single day we make lots of decisions. We decide what we're going to where we decide what we're going to eat, where we're going to spend our time, the things that we're going to watch all of these decisions, but really our life comes down to two choices. And that is are we going to serve God or serve ourselves? You think about everything else in God's creation. The sun, the moon, the stars, the oceans. The weather patterns, everything operates and, and, in a sense obeys God's word. It was set in place, and it does exactly what God intended it to do. Animals Act based upon instinct, and they do what God designed them to do. But man is different. God doesn't come and force Cain to do something, he doesn't make him act a certain way. He doesn't overpower him. But instead, we see him urging, imploring, trying to convince Kane. But in the end, it's Kane's decision. And that's the same for you and me today, all of us have the decision about whether we are going to accept God and follow him or not. Just before the children of Israel, we're about to go in to the promised land. Moses set before them the two paths and Deuteronomy chapter 30. And he said, See, I have set before you today life, and good, or death, and evil. I think that's what God is saying to Cain here. If you do what's right, if you do, well, will you not be accepted? Will you not receive life, and goodness. One summer, my brother and I decided to set up a bike jump out in the street. It's pretty primitive, we just got a big board. And then we started stacking bricks under one side. So we put two bricks up and went off the ramp. And then we put another two bricks up and went off. And finally that thing started getting pretty tall. And when we had got it up to its highest point that no one had ever gone off of we started arguing about who would be first. And then I lost the argument. So my brother gets on the top of the hill, and he comes flying down, he hits that thing, he gets some big air. And then he just starts to do kind of a rainbow and his front tire hits the front of the street first. And then he goes over the handlebars. And so I run inside to get mom and as I'm coming back out, I'm thinking to myself, you know, sometimes it does pay to be the youngest kid in the family. We live in a world of cause and effect. There are, there are consequences for the things that people choose to do, the decisions that we make, they can have lasting impact. For my brother, it was some scrapes and bruises. But when we engage in sin, when we give ourselves over to sin, the effects can be much more devastating. God is trying to help Cain see that if you choose the path of life, you choose the path of blessing. And so no matter what has happened to you and your life, no matter what you've been through up to this point, whether good or bad, whether you've been successful or whether you've struggled a lot. At this point, we still have the ability to choose for ourselves this day, who we're going to serve. If we walk in his path, we find his favor His mercy and His grace. God says do well and be accepted. The other side of that is, if you do not do well, then you choose if you don't choose God's path. He says in verse seven that sin is waiting for you. It's crouching at the door. Its desire is for you. God personifies sin as an animal here, a hunter that is stalking its prey, it's ready to pounce.

Conrad Harkrider  19:04
I had a friend growing up that his dad was a big hunter. And one time he went out on one of his trips and he caught a rattlesnake. Full Size rattlesnake. He brought it home, put it in an aquarium, and they stuck it in their garage. So I came over one day and he said do you want to see our new pet snake? I said sure. So we went out to the garage and as we opened up the door, you could hear the rattle going. And as we crept around the corner, you saw the glass and that thing just rose up off of the ground. And as we started to creep closer to where it was situated all the sudden the snake just started to strike and its face hit the glass. And of course we run back inside we bolt the door, you know the snakes not going anywhere, but we're terrified. What if instead of sitting behind and a glass aquarium that rattlesnake is just on the floor in the garage. How many of us are just walking in there to go see it? How many of us are opening it up and and going to take a look? Something that is poisonous and dangerous is sitting behind the door waiting to buy anyone who walks through. And that's what sin is like First Peter chapter five and verse eight. God says that sin is like a roaring lion. The devil is like a roaring lion prowling around seeking someone to devour. God's help trying to help Cain to see the seriousness of sin. This is something that can kill us. But how often do we treat it as something so casual, we put the snake right next to us. We put it in our car or our pocket or our living room or we walk around with it, we act like it's no big deal. And yet, all the while there is something that is so close to us and we are about to get bitten. Have we have we become callous to the danger and the devastating effect that sin has? James for in verse seven says, resist the devil and he will flee from you resist the devil. Oftentimes, we don't put up very much resistance. Paul said part of resisting is to put up safeguards he told Timothy to flee youthful lusts, to remove ourselves from the situation. In Proverbs chapter seven, there's a young man who goes out into the street and he just passes by the House of the adulterous woman. He puts himself in proximity. And that's his first mistake. Opening himself up. Resistance is about putting in safeguards sin has is like a root system. It's like a tree. And so the longer it goes undealt with it just grows deeper and deeper in our hearts, it becomes very difficult to remove. That's why it's so important for us to make corrections along the way when we see something, to address it, to seek out for help to ask for others to assist to encourage. Jesus said, we should treat it as if we're going to cut it off, tear it out, throw it away from us. Sin is waiting at the door. Notice what God says to Cain here at the end of this conversation in verse seven. He says but you must rule over it. You must rule over it. It is possible to overcome God is telling Kane that you can beat this. You can be successful. You can over come. First Corinthians chapter 10 And verse 13 says No temptation has overtaken you except such as it's common to man. But God is faithful, who will not allow you to be tempted beyond what you are able, but with the temptation will also make the way of escape that you may be able to bear it. Do we believe that it is possible to have victory over lust, over pride over jealousy? Over a temptation.

Conrad Harkrider  23:56
The song says Be strong and courageous through God you will win the great be the armies of error sin. We have to believe and know that we can rule over and overcome our sin. Of course, this is not a trivial matter. Sin is something that is a constant presence. Its temptation is always near to us. The devil is never going to stop working on us think about Jesus Christ, the Son of God. And yet Satan is working on him constantly, even to the end of his ministry is trying to derail him and get him off of the track that God had laid before him. And we're no different. The struggle against sin is going to be constant. But that's one of the reasons why we need to come together on such a consistent basis. Because we're not fighting this battle alone. We're not Facing the enemy by ourselves, we have brothers and sisters that are going through similar trials. And we need to bear one another's burdens, to reach out to each other and fight this battle together. When I come to services, it's not to say that I'm perfect or that I'm flawless. It's to say that I'm not giving up. I got out of bed and I'm here, I'm trying. And I feel the same way about you. When we come together it is we are resolving together, to serve God and to overcome sin. Ultimately, Cain is going to make a decision that will alter his life forever. He rejects God's plea for change. He takes it up another level and he kills his brother. And eventually we'll leave and go away from the presence of the Lord. And you see, as you read through Genesis, his decisions have an impact on generation after generation, because of the choices that he was making, but we can make a different, we can choose a different path. We can choose to take God's grace, what he's extending to us, to come to Him and ask for forgiveness and strength and support and to walk with Him. To know that he is a God that is gracious and forgiving and kind and he'll help us through our struggles and our temptations. We're going to close with a song to encourage you if there's something that we can do to help you in your walk with Christ. We offer this opportunity you can come down to the front as we stand and seen
