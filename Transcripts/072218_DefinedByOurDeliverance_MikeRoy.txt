I want to tell you that I never tire of seeing those old songs that convey such powerful truths to us. In fact, all the songs appreciate what you learned this morning, Jeremy, all the songs help us to keep our mind focused on the greatness of God and all that he has done for us. But these songs give us an opportunity to praise him to thank him. But also reminds us of what's been done for us. I was reading yesterday, an email of get different emails from companies or book publishers and I came across an article that caused me to change my sermon yesterday. It's written by a young writer, apparently. And it must be a chapter that was called defined by deliverance. And I was already been working on my sermon all week, and I decided to change gears mystery, which happens a lot. But anyway, I thought about this particular article. So I started to read it, of course, haven't read the book. But that particular thought got my attention. And it raised a question in my mind that made me think, what is it that defines you? So I want to think about this for just a moment as we get started this morning. So what defines you and me is how much money you make. And I make a lot of money or have made a fair amount of money, I felt pretty good about myself, but I don't have much money at all, I feel horrible. Like, where's the next meal coming from? So these are some things that we use to define ourselves, how tall you are, or how short you are. So if I'm my face, I feel really good about myself. And if I'm micro I'm so great sometimes. how pretty you are, how plain you might be? Or how big or how small you might be. Sometimes we use these things to define ourselves how smart you are, how intelligent are with the lack thereof, we can use these as ways that we measure our worth. What about our hair? We defined by our hair? I hope not. Every time I get ready for worship, I look in the mirror, make sure I covered all the weak spots there. Don't want you to see where they're getting thin up there. Did my hair define me? I hope it doesn't. What about freckles? Or back in the day that pimples? Or age spots? I notice more of those age spots? Like what am I going to do about this? This is really bad, bad news. What about our sins? And our failures? Do they define us? If we're Christians? Hope not. They should not? What about your successes in your strengths? What about your mistakes are we defined by these things I'm speaking primarily I guess, to those of us who have obeyed the gospel of Christ. But very often these things define us. And these are not the definition that God gives for how we define ourselves. And so taking the title of that particular chapter, which I haven't read that, but this is the title of my lesson, I want you to think about this principle that we are defined by our deliverance, our deliverance from sin. I'm going to expand on that here this morning. But that's the title of my lesson. And I want us to think about that. And what I want us to do is focus on some very powerful, short, but powerful truths that can change our lives. And so actually what I want us to be thinking about, I put together three points that I want us to look at, to suggest how we are defined and how God defines us how we should define ourselves. So we're defined by our deliverance from St. That's what defines you think about that in just a moment. We're defined by our destiny, where we're going God has your name reserved in a Lamb's book of life. Conrad, Trevor, Emily, David, whoever it might be. And then we're defined by divine love. We just sing about singing about that this morning. So let me just lined it up a little bit better. Maybe David can help me with this.

Mike Roy  04:24
So here it is. This is just kidding there, but a little tool of alliteration. So the three Ds have our definition. So again, I think back in the day, preaches used to use simple approaches like that. So I was thinking about that yesterday. And I want you to be just think about these three principles that define who we are in our worth to God and when our world should be to ourselves. So we're really defined by God's delivering us from our sins, by our destiny that awaits us. And we're defined by God's love. And these are powerful In Plain Truth, but we have to repeat them on a regular basis because society and culture in the media tell us otherwise. That we don't measure up in some ways. So the first point I want us to think about this morning, it will be looking at some secret scriptures that I'll have primarily on the screen, want to suggest to each of us that we are defined by our deliverance from sin? That's who we are thinking in terms of God, rescuing us from a life of sin. Think about what happened in Thailand recently, was it 12 boys and a coach who went as soccer players after a practice or whatever, they went into a cave, and then the floods rose and they get trapped? And how long did this go on? And and how much money was spent people from all over the world came to descend on this place to save these kids. Why? Because they have worth, it was worth it. And so the point I'm making here is we are defined by our deliverance. God saved this from our sins, because he values us, He loves us. He wants us to be a part of His family. This is taught in Scripture, we see this in a number of different verses. So in Colossians, chapter one and verses 13 and 14, Paul says that He has delivered us from the domain of darkness and transferred us into the kingdom of his beloved His beloved Son, in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of our sins. So one of the points that Paul was making here to Christians at Colossae, that God has delivered us we do sing about that in a couple of songs, God delivered us from the domain of darkness. We weren't in a cave of water. We were in a cave of sin. And God rescued us. Where does our worth come from? It's not from how tall I am, or how smart I am, or how well I can shoot a basketball or not. It's God rescued us. The ultimate rescue effort not sending people around the world to rescue some boys in a cave, he sent his Son from heaven, to this earth to rescue us from the domain of darkness. And he transferred us into the kingdom of his beloved Son, in whom we have one of the songs we sang about redeemed. Redemption. I appreciate mark, sharing, being transparent forgetting his jacket, and how would that didn't get in on his body and to the church building? And sometimes we all do that type of thing. I forget my key where I put my keys, sometimes I forget where my truck is. I mean, not like, I don't know what's not in a driveway. But if I'm at Lowe's or something, I go in one entrance, and I come out of the other entrance, where's my truck? I can't find this big truck, too. But we forget those things. Do we sometimes forget, brethren, that we've been redeemed by the blood of Christ, that would be something terrible to forget. And so that's what Paul is reminding us of that God has delivered us. He rescued us. Why? Because he loves you because it's worth it because he values you because we have worth to him. So Paul mentions that here in Colossians, chapter one. In First Thessalonians chapter one, verses nine and 10. Paul writes to the Christians here sinful they themselves report concerning us to kinds of reception we had among you, and how you turn to God from idols. These were idolaters for Thorin, they turned to God from idols to serve the living in true God, and to wait for his Son from heaven, who he raised from the dead Jesus, who delivers us from the wrath to come and others coming wrath. We don't like to think about that. And some may disagree with that. But the Scripture clearly says that the wrath of God is going to come on the sons of disobedience. Gonna come on all those who reject His will. Jesus delivered us rescued

Mike Roy  09:01
us from the coming wrath. Wow. So that's why I say we're, we're defined, we should be in the most fundamental way by our deliverance, what God has done for for each one of us. And again, it's not that these people they weren't perfect people. In fact, they had all types of flaws just like we do. But Jesus delivers us from the wrath to come. And another passage that is so powerful to me in Romans chapter five, verses six through 11. Paul writes over here in verse six, when he says, For a while we were still weak, at the right time, Christ died for the ungodly. That's you and me. I don't care what sins you wrestle with anger, greed, pride, lust, adultery, fornication, whatever it may be. God rescued us because He loves us. And so this verse says that while we were still weak at the right time, Christ died for the ungodly. For one will scarcely die for a righteous person. Though perhaps we're a good person when we even dare to die, but God shows His love for us and that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us. Since therefore we have been now have now been justified by blood, much more shall we be saved by Him from the wrath of God. For a while we were sinners, we were reconciled to God by the death of his Son, much more now, much more now that we erect, we are reconciled, shall we be saved by His life. More than that we also rejoice in God through our Lord Jesus Christ through whom we have now received the reconciliation. So Paul is making the argument from the lesser to the greater over here that, you know, it's one thing God loved us while we were steeped in sin. And if God loved us, while we were steeped in sin, and all the stuff that I just talked about, and more and drunkenness and anger, you name all this stuff, the horrible sins that I've been guilty of in my life, and you may have been in your life, God loved us in that state of depravity, rescued us from the coming wrath, how much more does he love you now that you're his son or daughter in Christ? Don't measure yourself by how tall, you are short, you are big or small, smart or dumb? Doesn't matter in God's perspective. So that's what Paul is saying over here that, you know that how much more? Does God love us, because we have responded to the Gospel. And so the point I want to make, in this lesson, I'm conveying in really simple terms, three, could have used a lot more points, three simple truths, that if you'll repeat these things, it can it can make a difference in your life, we have been number one, we are defined by our deliverance. Think about that you don't deliver people that are worthless, right? If you had no worth God would leave you and your sin and me and my sin. If these boys in the cave were worthless, we wouldn't they wouldn't do anything. But they were rescued, because they have inherent worth. So think about your worth and your value and how you define yourself. So we're defined by the amazing rescue effort that God put in place, had in his mind, we've been studying Ephesians. This morning, in our class, before the foundation world, God had a plan to rescue us from our sins to save us for eternal glory. And so understand that a very basic way that were defined by our deliverance. Think about that. And even though those are truths that we are aware of the reality is we need to remind ourselves of that on a regular basis. And what I do, I put these these kinds of truths in my journal, I put them on my phone, or maybe on an iPad or something, and I say those out loud, when you're really down in the dumps, say I have, I'm defined by my deliverance from sin, not because I just failed in business, not because I didn't pass a course, we're not because I, I failed out of the basketball game, or lost, lost the game from my team lost the championship for my team. That's not what defines us. So the first kind of powerful proverbial thought I want us to think about is that we are defined by the fact that God delivered us from our sins. Secondly, I

Mike Roy  13:16
want you to think about this again, very basic point. But it's a powerful truth, it can be very liberating to to each one of us. We are defined by our glorious destiny. Where are we going as Christians that of course I understand. We have to be faithful to God, we're not talking about sinlessness. Nobody can do it. I can't do it. You can't do it. We have to be obedient to God. We want to not forsake the assembly of the Lord's people. We need to be involved in worship, where the Christians go when they die. Where do we go when we die? What does God say about that? It's a glorious place called heaven. And so what I want us to think about is, again, because we so often define our lives and wrong ways, remind ourselves that we're we're defined by the destiny that awaits us a glorious destiny. We see this in Scripture. In Ephesians chapter one and verse 1112, Paul says, in him or in Christ, we have obtained and inheritance, having been predestined according to the purpose of him who works all things according to the counsel of his will, so that we who were the first hope in Christ might beat the praise of his glory. So understand that everything that God did to rescue you and me to deliver us from our stands, ultimately results in his praise and glory, but what what we get in the process, though, and inheritance and that's what we need to be thinking about. So I'm defined by the inheritance that awaits me in heaven and awaits you in heaven. If I think about my earthly inheritance, inheritance I might get discouraged because my dad he didn't leave not gonna leave me anything. In fact, I'm probably gonna have to chip in help pay for his burial. So the earthly inheritance may be big or small, but what we have from God is an eternal inheritance. But look at this, this word over here, we've been predestined. That's a phrase or word that we kind of don't like to talk about, because in a denominational world has been misused, and all that type of thing, but it's a biblical principle. And that means before the world was fashion, God predetermined, that those who would obey the gospel of Christ was share eternity with Him. What other word comes from that? Can you see? Destiny? Destination predestined? So I'm saying, what defines us? What should define us, is our glorious destiny, where are you going? It's not to California, or Spain, or Colorado, it's heaven. best, best a place that God has reserved for those of us who are going to serve Him and do His will. And so the point I'm making here is that we need to focus on these simple, powerful truths that can shape our perspective and give us the proper sense of self worth that we have. And so often we, we measure ourselves in a wrong way. But when we focus on this principle that we're defined by our destiny,

Unknown Speaker  16:18
bad people don't go to heaven. Horrible people not going to be in heaven.

Mike Roy  16:23
But those who have been washed in the blood of Christ bill be in heaven. And so it's a glorious destiny. And so the good thesis chapter one, verses 13, and 14, Paul says, In Him, you also when you heard the word of the truth of truth, the gospel of your salvation, and believed in him, from our Christians, they obeyed the gospel, they heard his word they believe, look what it says about making sure that we don't miss out on this destination, that that wish we had been predetermined by the mind of God. So if you were sealed with the Holy, the promised Holy Spirit, don't understand all of what that means. But God wants to make sure that he that we know where we're going when we die. There's not like a hit or miss I sure hope I get to go to heaven when I die. Sometimes we pray like that, wait a minute. And it's there's no room for any arrogance here or Cacique. We're saved by God's grace. But God wants us to have some assurance, we sometimes think about that Blessed assurance, Jesus's mind, over the foretaste of what glory divine. And so Paul said, we've been sealed, protected with the Holy Spirit of promise, who is the guarantee of our inheritance is the ESV. Until we acquire possession of it, what defines you a second principle is that we're defined by our glorious destiny, think about that. You may never have a big house in this world might not live on the lake. A lot of my customers do and but doesn't matter where you live, what size house you live in, if you live in a tent, have a sit through the years, I've been here a long time, Abraham lived his whole life in a tent, a tent, maybe in a two room tent, I don't know. But it was a tent. And I think it has some flaps at the breeze book through it, you know, and so Sarah wouldn't be so you know, upset and fussy, and all that kind of stuff. But we're going to glorious place called heaven. And so we need to be thinking about that. And again, it's to the praise of God's glory. Look at First Peter chapter three. This conveys the idea that we focus on the glorious destiny. So our destiny defines us, right? If I'm going to, you know, an area of the world and living in a slum area, that's not something that's going to be very motivating to me or to you. But when we think about the that heaven, the glory of heaven awaits us, that does motivate us, and it helps to define who we are. We're citizens of heavens of God's kingdom. So Peter says, blessed to be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, according to His great mercy, he has caused us to be born again. So these are people that have obeyed the gospel. That's you, that's me to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ went dead to an inheritance. Don't forget about your narratives. If the stock market goes up, I get excited. Wow, you made $1,000 This week, stock market goes down like oh, man, it goes, there goes my investment. But we get an inheritance. What's the character of that inheritance? It says it's in perishable, it will never spoil. It will never rot, it will never decay. An inheritance that is undefiled that cannot be corrupted. And if you save your gold coins or silver coins and put them in a safe deposit box at the bank would over time if you don't test them, they start to get little dirt in maybe even some pitting that type of thing, even good products. It's gonna get tarnished. This inheritance is unfading You know, I'm in the business of helping people fix up their homes and sold to some people roof and gutters Windows recently, and we talked about the value of the vinyl siding. So well, it's really good. It's gonna last a while, but eventually it's going to fade back to your, for y'all to have roofs that we put on, they're all going to fake I have to tell you better. So get ready for that they are fading as I speak. So if you need a new roof, just give me I'll talk to you after church. So but so but but heavens, the glory of heaven isn't fading, it will never fade. There's nothing in this Earth that doesn't fade, everything fades. And I'm fading as I speak. We're your face failing is where you're listening to me. And so Heaven is a place of glory that is unfading that's kept in heaven for you. So what defines us? We're defined by our glorious destiny, write that down, it's worth more than a million dollars, it's worth your soul. Put that in your your notebook, put that in your phone, whatever you do. We're defined by our destiny, where are we going to be with God? That makes me worthwhile from from a human perspective, I

Mike Roy  21:11
sometimes I don't have a lot of work, but from a heavenly perspective I do. So when Peter talks about getting this inheritance that is imperishable, undefiled, unfading kept in heaven for you who by God's power of being guarded, is not going away. And God is going to make sure that we get there if we put our trust in Him. If we don't forsake the assembling of ourselves together. If we don't throw in the towel says I can't do it anymore. This is too hard for me, brother, Mike, I just can't make any more. Now. Why would you do that? For what's in store eternal glory. So if we're defined by our destiny, I'm going to keep on going. I trust that you will to one of the passages in Second Timothy chapter four verses seven and eight. Paul said, I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race I have kept the faith. He said henceforth, there is later for me the crown of righteousness. Wow, was Paul driven by the His glorious destiny that awaited him? He said, I fought the fight. I have finished the race. I have kept the faith. He didn't do it perfectly. He was the cheapest of sinners before its conversion. And he struggled with sand just like you do. And I do. But Paul said, was laid out for me my destiny is a crown of righteousness. You said, but Mike, that's the apostle Paul, who can be like the apostle Paul, I'll never be like the apostle Paul, not me. No way ever. He said, and then he says, wish the Lord the righteous judge will award to me so don't forget Britain is this an awards Day coming up? Sometimes kids in school, think about, you know, whatever the day is, December 15, is awards day I get my academic honor, I get my trophy for running that race. The awards day is for running the race of life and winning. But then Paul says that this is not to me only, but to also to all who have loved disappearing. That's you read when God places the crown of righteousness on your head, in spite of all your sins, and in spite of all of my sins. That was Paul's focus. He was driven, he was driven by his glorious death, he was defined by his glorious destiny I'm going to heaven is worth more to me than anything else. And my goal is to get my family there, and you and everybody else who listen to my voice. So that's a second powerful principles, write it down. We are defined, not by how tall or short we are, how smart or not smart, we are defined by our glorious destiny. And then number three, I want to suggest to us that we're defined as we've sung this morning somebody songs by love, divine love divine, all else excelling, joy of heaven to earth, come down. So think about it in that terms that we so often to define ourselves in all the wrong ways but we are defined by God's love. We need to remember that and so the reason I priestess with such conviction, but such energy is because we forget these things. We just totally forget, we get caught up in the world and the bills pile up and have family issues or debt to deal with or sickness, or whatever it may be. And we forget that God loves you with an infinite love. That's a game changer. That's a life changer when you understand that everything that God did for you is because He loves you. And I know what you're thinking like, you don't know me. Yeah, I do because I know made. I know your weaknesses because I bet the same ones. When you look at scripture, this is the message that God gives us and John chapter three verses 14 217 It says Moses lifted up the serpent, the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up that whoever believes in Him may have eternal life. Then it's in verse 16, For God so loved the world, that He gave His only Son that whoever believes in Him should not perish but have eternal life. For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world. But in order that the world might be saved through Him, God's goal is to get you into heaven, and get me into heaven. He that's why he rescued us he did he have to get his love. So again, when we think about how we so often define ourselves the wrong way, all the wrong ways. But in a very basic way, I remind myself of this truth that I hope that you will do the same, that we are defined by divine love. And we need to remember that principle. But First John, chapter three, John's one of his epistles says the same kind of thing. So first, John chapter three verses

Mike Roy  26:06
one and two, John says, Behold, what manner of love the Father has bestowed on us that we should be called children of God, therefore the world does not know us, because it did not know him, beloved, so that's us, says, Now we are children of God, and it has not yet been revealed, but we shall be. But we know that when He is revealed, we shall be like Him, for we shall see Him as He is. So as children loved by God, there's our destiny as well, seeing God face to face began in verse one is a, a powerful truth that we need to remind ourselves of when John says, Behold what manner of love or see the magnitude of God's love the Father, what the Father has bestowed of us, that we should be called children of God. So again, the third point I want us to take away from this lesson this morning, as we talked about how we define ourselves, we are, we are defined by divine love, everything that God did for you, and continues to do in terms of meeting your needs, and putting bread in your mouth and sending rain and sunshine on to you and your house. And he did that because he loves you. And so we're defined by, by, by divine love, and so hope that you'll think about these principles, as we seek to keep our minds focused on the things that God has put in store for us. And so the question, I guess we will get to that, and just, oh, I'm meant to put this one back in here. We looked at Romans chapter five a minute ago, but jumped in there at Verse eight says, But God shows His love for us and that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us. Again, everything that God has done for us, is he did so because of his love for us. So the question that we ask ourselves, what defines you? Who defines you? How are you defined? Well, hopefully we understand this morning. That no matter if you don't feel like if you don't feel worthy, if you don't feel like you measure up, or you made too many bad decisions, live the life of sin too long in your life or still struggle with sin. That's not how that's not what defines if we're Christians, were defined by the Divine deliverance that we receive from God, we were defined by the glorious destiny that awaits us. And we're defined by divine love. So the real question though, as we extend the invitation, is the question Have you been delivered from sin? If you haven't been delivered from sin, then that's the one thing that you need to get done so you can be part of God's kingdom and enjoy the blessing of being in His Kingdom having forgiveness of your sins. If there's anyone here this morning, who needs to respond to the invitation, we invite you to come while we stand and sing this invitation song
