Good morning. It's good to see everyone here today. It's certainly a good day. The Psalmist said that he was glad when he could go to the house of the Lord. And we can, we can say the same thing. Worship gives us purpose shows us our purpose and gives us direction gives us a peace as we go through the chaos of life, doesn't it? So it's good to be here. And I'm glad that you're here with us this morning. We have several guests. We have some forum members, the cases are here we have other visitors, we're glad that you're here with us. Our goal at Broadmoor is to give God glory and honor and praise and all that we do, not only hear in worship as we come together, but also in our lives. So that's what we're striving to do. And we're glad that you're here with us this morning. Our theme this year has been on Kingdom citizens Kingdom citizens, we focused on what it means to be a kingdom citizen, considering the character and how we can be as the people of God, citizens of the kingdom, not of not of this earth, but of the kingdom of heaven. And so we have sought first and focused on seeking first that kingdom, we thought about our citizenship is primarily being in heaven, and not here. As we think about the character of Kingdom citizens. One of the the primary characteristics as we look at this is his holiness, holiness. If you would open your Bibles to First Peter chapter two, we're going to be looking at the first 12 verses, we're going to be looking at four keys to holy living, four keys to holy living.

Jeremy Sweets  01:51
Chapter Two follows the themes that are found at the end of chapter one. So I'm somewhat stepping into the middle of the train of thought here. Earlier in First Peter, we see that Peter instructed them that they would prepare their minds for action, that they would be holy, just as God is holy, that they would not conform their actions to their former way of living the passions of their former ignorance, he says, but rather that they would live holy and acceptable lives to God as he gets into chapter two, and you'll remember that Peters a preacher in Acts chapter two, all our kids know this, right? Peter stood up, how many of you convert 3000 We're gonna ignore him probably hit some of that tonight and our kids class. But Peter stood up and began to preach, when you see some of that preaching here in chapter two, as he looks at each one of these sections, we're going to have four and I think he has four sections here. He's going to give an instruction as a preacher. But he's also going to use a an image, similes and metaphors, an illustration to make his point. And he's also going to give a reason or a purpose involved in this instruction. So he's following up on this thought of being holy. So as we're thinking about being Kingdom citizens, how can we be holy people today? Well, let's consider some of the keys that Peter provides. And maybe we can put those in practice in our lives as well. First of all, we need to long for the Word of God long for the Word of God. As an infant, we see this in the first three verses, if you would read with me, second, or First Peter two, one through three. He says, so put away all malice and all the seats and hypocrisy and envy and all slander, like newborn infants long for the pure spiritual mill, that by it, you may grow up into salvation, if indeed you have tasted that the Lord is good. Now this follows the passage that was immediately given before it found in verses 22 and 23 of the previous chapter. Let me read that just so you can see the connection that he makes here. In chapter one, verse 22, he says, having purified your souls by obedience to the truth, for a sincere brotherly love, love one another earnestly from a pure heart, since you had been born again not of perish, we'll see but of imperishable through the living and abiding word of God. There he talks about the fact that our job or our purpose is to love one another. And that makes sense since we've been born again of the imperishable seed of the Word of God. Now, as it comes to chapter two, he's going to say, put away these sins and what sins are these he says, now? Less deceit, hypocrisy, envy, slander, these particular sins are those sins that are disruptive to fellowship, the kinds of sins that create friction and fighting between people. So put that away. Instead live with love for one another. In verse two, he says, like newborn infants, long for the pure spiritual milk. In our family, as our kids get older, we've tried to stress several different concepts. But one of those words is flexibility, flexibility. And so especially in a large family, you don't always get what you want. And sometimes you have to give that up, you have to be flexible with those things. And particularly if you have younger children in the family, you have to be flexible, you can't always get what you want. You'll notice I said that as they get older, I'm trying to teach them about flexibility. Now, if you have an infant at home, you know that that infant is not flexible. In fact, you have to be flexible for your infant. Infants have very few needs, but the needs they have they they go after with a passion, they need sleep, they need food, don't they long for that food. And if they don't have their food, they began to cry. And they need it regularly. They don't they don't like to skip feedings every two or three hours are you in the middle of sleep? Well, that doesn't matter to an infant. It's time for sleep, or it's time for food and they will let you know.

Jeremy Sweets  06:44
You see that infants long they desire and you can see the intensity of their desire, that they desire their food. Here, the text says that we are to be like newborn infants and our desire for God's word. And notice what this word is. It's the pure spiritual milk. As we think about God's word, there is a purity in its truth. And it is provided for us. Infants need their milk so that they can grow. Christians need God's Word so that they can grow in verse too long for the pure spiritual milk that by it, you may grow up into salvation. We need to have an earnest desire and a longing for God's word, because it's essential to our growth. There will be something terribly wrong medically with a child that would not eat. The same is true for Christians that are not eating there is something terribly wrong if you are not partaking of and longing for the pure spiritual milk of God. But as Christians, we need it for growth so that we may grow up unto salvation. The Bible uses salvation in two senses. Oftentimes, there is a salvation in the sense of something that is immediate, having your sins washed away. But what is involved, there's really more of a promise and looking forward to we're not ultimately saved until the end and judgment comes. And we've been found to be righteous. And so in one sense, we're always looking for and yearning for our salvation, looking ahead to the time when Christ will come again, or then we die in weighpads. And so he says that you are too long for the pure spiritual milk that you may grow up into salvation. Verse three, he goes on to say, if indeed you have tasted that the Lord is good. Notice the imagery that he continues to use, longing for the milk, that you may grow if you have tasted, that the Lord is good. This reminds us of the fact that they were saved, they were born again by the word of God, they have already experienced God's goodness, they have already seen that. But there's also a connection not only for what has happened in the past, but in which they are shown that even more and more as they partake of the milk of the spiritual word, hear, as they long for that they can indeed taste that the Lord is good. Notice the connection between God's word and an understanding of who God is and his goodness. God's word reveals that a lot of times as we struggle through life, we we have difficulties with God's goodness, if we would face the challenges of life or things that seem unfair, we may begin to question that but It is God's Word that points us again and again and again to his goodness. Now we need that view of Scripture because our view is like a horse with blinders. We only see what's in front of us, we only see what is limited. We only see what is right now. And often that pain can be real as we experienced those things and begin to question how is this fair? Why is it like this, but scripture opens our view up to Eternity. And there is no doubt. When we open our view up to scriptures view we see that God is good. God is good. So let us long for the pure spiritual milk of the word. I think that's an essential key, in holy living in holy living.

Jeremy Sweets  10:55
In verses four through eight, we need to understand that we should build upon Jesus as a temple or as a holy dwelling. Notice in verse four, as you come to him, a Livingstone rejected by men, but in the sight of God chosen and precious, you yourselves live, or you yourselves like living stones, are being built up as a spiritual house to be a holy priesthood, to offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ. For it stands in Scripture, Behold, I am laying in Zion, a stone, a Cornerstone, chosen and precious, and whoever believes in him will not be put to shame. So the honor is for you who believe. But for those who do not believe the stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone, and a stone of stumbling and a rock of offense, they stumble, because they disobey the word as they were destined to do. Notice the imagery that he uses here, he says, as he looks to Jesus Christ, first of all, Jesus Christ was a living stone that was rejected by men, rejected by men. Now you can think if you have building supplies or materials, you know, if you go to the hardware store, you're going to find some lumber, some of that is going to be bad, some of that's going to be good, you need to put aside the bad. Well, that's what the world did with Jesus Christ. And John one, it says that Jesus is the light of the world, but the world and darkness did not comprehend Him. There it says in John one that Jesus was the creator of the world, but the world did not receive him. It says in that passage as well that Jesus came to his own, but even his own did not receive Him. Jesus was rejected. He was rejected by men, but notice that he was not rejected by Gong, you'll remember at His baptism, and at the Transfiguration, that God spoke down, his sentiment, his feeling, this is my beloved Son in whom I am well pleased. You see, these things play side by side, rejection by men, but being accepted and loved and cherished by God, that's the living stone that we are building upon. And that's why he says that just as Christ our living stone, was rejected by men, but precious in the sight of God, verse five, you yourselves, like living stones are being built up as a spiritual house. Notice that we are a building a holy building, we are a temple. The imagery is of not of, of inanimate building material stones, or lumber or something like that. But we are living stone. As we think about the people of God and who we are, we are people that has shown to be a building of God. We are the people that are to be those that function as a temple. In fact, notice the purpose that He provides here, yourselves like living stones are being built up as a spiritual house, in order to be or to be a holy priesthood, to offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ. What was the function of a temple in the Old Testament? What what happened there? sacrifices were made there. What was the function of priests? Well, they would come to the temple and they would offer sacrifices what? What is it that Jesus Christ came to the earth to do? He came to offer Himself as a sacrifice. And as Christians, we are building upon the very chief cornerstone of Jesus Christ, we are building upon that so that we can be a building a temple, so that we can offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God. Now we're gonna suffer the same, same

Jeremy Sweets  15:25
reaction or reception that Jesus did. The world's not gonna love us when we point to the gospel. When we talk about denying ourself and serving someone else serving God, that's not going to be a popular message. And we may we may be rejected just like Christ was. Our goal was not to be prickly. Our goal is not to upset people, our goal is not to be rejected. But when you place the two side by side, God and men, God is our chief concern. And we want to be accepted by him regardless of how others would receive us. Now if we can serve God, and others, welcome that or be okay with that, the next what we want to do, but God is our chief concern, we're going to serve him even if others dislike it, even if others mock us, even if we're considered out of step or strange, even if others persecute us. So no, we're not seeking persecution. But really, that's out of our purview that's out of our sight. Our primary goal is to serve God, come what may, regardless of what will happen, we will serve God. And as we do that, we are offering up spiritual sacrifices as a very temple of God, spiritual sacrifices we come before him to worship. As we think about holy living, we can think about the importance of worship in our lives. I mentioned as we come together, we receive our purpose, and our direction, we know where we are going in the chaos of life, and that is essential to holy living. We get so wrapped up in the affairs of the world and the the wants and desires of the world. We need a continual grounding, and reminding, first of all, that we are not the center of the universe, that God is all mine, that God is above us. And we are merely creatures that are His servants, we need that message pounded into our head over and over again. First of all, because we forget that second of all, because it's essential to holy living, when we become selfish, and self centered, holy living goes out the door. But when we will focus on God and worshiping Him holy living will come in the door. And so we offer spiritual sacrifices not only of worship, but of our bodies. You'll remember in Romans chapter 12, verses one and two, there are talks about our bodies are a living sacrifice, we give up what we want, and we serve God. So Peter looks to this temple so that we can offer spiritual sacrifices. And I believe that's essential to holy living. It's one of the keys that we need to consider.

Jeremy Sweets  18:41
Notice also in verses nine and 10, that we need to proclaim God's goodness as a holy nation, as a holy nation. And verse nine, he says, But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, of people for His own possession, that you know, that you may proclaim the excellencies of Him who called you out of darkness into His marvelous light. Once you were not a people, but now you're the people of God, once you had not received mercy, but now you have received mercy. He gives these four quick descriptions at the beginning of verse nine, a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation of people, I think in general that refers to a group of people, not only a group of people, not not necessarily just tied together by some civic concern or some mutual interest. But the type of people this is is a holy nation, a chosen or elect people. This really borrows from Exodus chapter 19. And that's interesting because that's talking about a nation they're a group of people. The is To realize they were chosen to be God's people to be God's light unto the nations, they were chosen for that purpose. How did you become an Israelite? Well, you were born into the nation. Understand there were some god fears that might have joined them from other nations. But for the most part, you were born into the Israelite nation. So in contrast to that now in Christ, who is the holy nation? Is it the Jews? Is it Americans, is that Egyptians, you can go through the nations who isn't? It is those as he mentioned in the previous passage, those that would obey Him, those that would seek after him, this nation is not determined by birth, but by choice, by choice. And so he can say with with new meaning here that you were once not a people. You were not part of this holy nation, you were not chosen of this chosen race. You were not a people of God's own possession. But now you can be His people. Now you can receive His mercy. And as we look at this passage, and see what is our goal, what is our purpose, he says, so that you vote so that you may proclaim the excellencies of Him who called you out of darkness into His marvelous light. To be able to move from darkness into light is such a grand and glorious thing. And maybe we take that for granted because we have light so often. But if you were trapped in a cave, if you were trapped in a dungeon, or if you were trapped, where there was no light, you would see the thankfulness that you would have for light, what a blessing that is. Spiritually, we understand that we are lost in our sins, there is a darkness in serving ourselves. There is a darkness in serving Satan. And Jesus Christ offers a flight. So as a nation, what is our goal? What is our purpose as Kingdom citizens, it is to proclaim something. It is to tell other people something, it is to tell others of God's goodness, the the excellencies of his glorious light, his marvelous light, and the fact that we were once not a people, but now we are a people. So you see the transition. And we are able to proclaim that other people. Here he talks about being a holy nation, a nation founded on holiness. And I think it's a key to thinking about that, that we would not only live wholly ourselves, but proclaim that to other people speak of God's goodness, we need to be reminded, as I mentioned in worship, but also as we tell other people, we need reminding over and over again. One thing I found that as I teach a class, I learned more than I do as a student, or maybe I learn in a different way. There's something about having to tell somebody else, something where you learn some different things than you do if you're just absorbing.

Jeremy Sweets  23:35
We will learn if we would proclaim his good deeds, we'll consider new things we'll think of new things will realize new things about his goodness, as we proclaim that I think proclaiming God's goodness is a key to holy living. Notice in verses 11 and 12, verses 11 and 12. And I'll mention I really intended just to preach on verses 11 and 12. Like probably knows what I'm talking about you kind of bring in the context. Well, that's good, I need to include that. So you end up getting the first 12 verses and there's no extra charge for that. But 11 and 12 is a fascinating passage and I think it's really helpful so read with me these two verses. Love it. I urge you as sojourners and exiles to abstain from the passions of the flesh, which wage war against your soul. Keep your conduct among the Gentiles honorable so that when they speak against you as evildoers, they may see your good deeds and glorify God on the day of visitation. You know, from grade score from being young, our goal if there is a goal of a child at elementary school is to fit in. The last thing you want to do is to stand out. That's why it's so important at that time, you know, Mom, I need these kinds of jeans. You know, I can't be from the store, I don't want to stand out, some of those things are so important to us. That's the goal. And if you think about maybe being a tourist, last year, Jessica and I were able to go to London and to Paris, and I remember I had French in high school. I'm not sure why. Anderson County, Kentucky is not a French speaking place. There are several Spanish but for some reason I chose France, but that's beside the point. So I chose French in high school. And I remember I tried to learn a few phrases so that I could try to brush up on this. And if I needed to talk or ask a question, I could do that. Bonjour. You know, come with tally view, how are you? Those kinds of things and so I was prepared when I went to Paris. And so I get ready to ask my question. You know, I'm trying to, it's not natural to me. So I'm trying to think of this and they say, how are you? They start speaking in English to me. I never had a chance to speak French and, and that's probably a good thing. I never had a chance. Why is that? I stood out through no effort of my own. It's not something I tried to do. People knew I was an American. They knew I spoke English. And before I could even jumble my sentences together and spit it out. They started speaking English to me, they knew who I was, I stood out, I stood out. Here, the text says in verse 11, and 12, I urge you as sojourners and exon. Christians are people who stand out. There are those that are strangers, strange, different. They come into town and say they're not from around here. And we see that Christians are those that are simply different. As we focus on being Kingdom citizens, that's something we need to accept. It's ingrained in us from elementary school on up we need to fit in, we need to look like the world. But the gospel tells us you need to be different. And we need to, again, we're not seeking to be different. We're not just trying to stand out, you know, painting our hair green and all of this kind of thing. We're not being loud and boisterous and saying, Hey, look at me, I'm different. But just like, you know, when I went overseas, I didn't, you know, I didn't wear a sign that says, I'm a tourist, but it was very obvious. It was very obvious. And Jessica and I talked about what is it about that that stands out, but we were different. And so it is for Christians, we're not going out. And our goal is we're going to look different and be different enforced that. But the truth is, we are simply going to be difference. Because of the path we have chosen in life, the narrow way, we are going to be different because of the God we serve. Instead of serving ourselves, we are going to be different as a natural consequence of the choice we've made to serve God.

Jeremy Sweets  28:25
And part of that is wholly living, our holy living our honorable conduct is going to make us standouts, we're going to look different. And so in verse 11, he says, I urge you to abstain from the passions of the flesh. If you abstain from the passions of the flesh and take a stand for that you will be different. You will be on you will be strange. What do you mean, you're not going to go out and get drunk with? Everybody's doing that? What do you mean you're gonna get quizzical looks? You mean you don't do that? It's going to be odd and strange when you say that I'm going to wait till I get married in order to have sexual relationship. That that is a purity that belongs inside of marriage. People are going to say you're You're weird. No one does that. Haven't you seen TV? Everybody is doing that before they get married. People are going to look at you as strange and odd. When you don't cuss or laugh at the crude jokes, people are going to look at you funny. Everybody's laughing at that. What? What's wrong with you? As they would see that what what is wrong with you. When you don't tune into the latest show and the latest shows are full of language violence and nudity. Maybe that's always been the case but the shows are pushing that more and more and more and more and when you're unaware of what's going on because you're not going to put that that kind of stuff into your head. What do you mean? You don't watch Game of Thrones? You don't you don't watch the newest show of this and that. That's, that's odd. Why what? Why not? Why don't you watch that? See, you're gonna stand out. You're simply going to be different. You're not going to be necessarily trying to that's not the goal, but you will be different. If you live in a holy way. Not only are we to refrain from things, and if we do, we'll stand out. But he goes on to say in verse 12, keep your conduct among the Gentiles honorable, honorable, where to do good deeds, as he says, Even later in this verse of those may see your good deeds. Were not only to abstain from fleshly loss and passions, but we are also to do good things, you will probably get equally odd looks when you respond to someone that screaming or mad at you is Trevor talked about with if you respond with gentleness, they were gonna say that's odd. are you weak? Are you just scared? What Why would you respond that way, you need to stand up for yourself, you need to respond and calm. When people are mean to you, and you're kind back, people are going to notice that and see that as string. Now, what is the point of this standing out? Well, in this text, he gives us a purpose clause. Keep your conduct among the Gentiles honorable so that when they speak against you as evildoers, they may see your good deeds and glorify God on the day of visitation. What is our goal and holy living? One of our goals, as seen in this passage is that we can take a center and through our godly conduct, they could change their allegiance. Remember, in the previous passage, there's it described the holy nation, he says, You were once not a people, that's us isn't. At one time we were lost in our sins. We were separate from Christ, we had no hope in the world. And so we were not a people of God at one point. But then we became the people of God choosing holiness, what is our goal for other people? What is our goal as we live holy, it's not to get a pat on the back. It's not so so others will just think that we're great. Our goal was so that others will see us and glorify God.

Jeremy Sweets  32:41
Our goal is that others would become those that once were not a people, once they had received no mercy, but now they can be a part of the people of God. They can be a holy nation, a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a people of God's own possession, so that they would change. Our goal is not self serving, and living a holy life. Our goal is part of a bigger picture, a bigger project, of bringing glory and honor to God. And bringing him that in all things in all things. I think if we would look at these four images, these pictures and these instructions and the purpose that's provided with each, I think we will live in a holier way. I think these things are helpful for us to think about and dwell on. Let me close with a point that I didn't focus too much on as we went through the lesson, but I want to think about it as we offer an invitation. In verse nine, he says, You're a chosen race or royal priesthood, a holy nation, people for His own possession, God's own people. In sin, we've rejected God and turned away we're like the prodigal son and says, I want nothing to do with you, God, and we've turned away from him. But when we come back to him and live according to His grace and mercy, we can be His own possession. We can be a people that belong to him, as it says in Exodus 19, I will be your God and you will be my people. There is no greater thought and all of Scripture than that we can be a child of God. You remember the protocol, he says, I'm not deserve. You know, I don't deserve to be a son. Just make me a servant. Make me lowly in your sight. And the father said, I hope none of you will be a son. And that's what God says to us. You know, we don't deserve to be God's children. We just deserve to be lowly servants that spend our entire Our lives serving Him. That's what we need to be a need to do. And it's only through God's goodness and His mercy and His grace, that God says, yes, you can serve me but you are my child. You're my child. If there's someone here this morning, that's not a Christian, you need to understand that you're not a child of God. But you can become a child of God, by relying upon His grace, mercy and the plan that he's provided for us in Jesus Christ, believing that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living God, repenting of your sins and turning away from a lifestyle of sin, to a lifestyle of service, confessing that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living God, and being baptized in the water for the forgiveness of your sins. That is the commitment that you make as a starting place. And the commitment you make is a lifetime of service to Him. And you need to be prepared to make that commitment. If you're here this morning, you're a Christian, understand you've made a lifetime commitment. no days off. If you're not living as your should. You need to make your life right this very morning. There's any subject to the invitation. Please come as we stand and sing at this time.
