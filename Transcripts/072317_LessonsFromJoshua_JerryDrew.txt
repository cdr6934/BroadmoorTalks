Unknown Speaker  00:00
Tonight, we are, as the song suggested, can be looking at some lessons that we can learn from Joshua, I have a choice of pointers, and I'm gonna guess one and see if I can get a good one here. Let's see if this works. Aha, look at that. So what I want to do is start off with a brief intro in what the book of Joshua actually covers, so that you understand kind of the topic that we're going to be looking at tonight. What I was looking for here, hold on just a second, this one might have it, I'm looking for a pointer. Got one, I got one. So here's a map, which I'm sure is very clear and understandable, especially if you're in the back of the auditorium right now. I tried to find the busiest map I could. And I think I succeeded in this. So what happened in Israel's history, from the time that they left Egypt was we see that Moses was put in charge of leading the Israelites out of Egypt. And he was told that he was to lead the people out and that he was to take them eventually to a land of of promise to a promised land. And that was a land that had been promised to Abraham to the descendants of Abraham. And so what ended up happening was not exactly the way they had hoped, originally, but you had the Israelites, there's my pointer. Now we're over in Egypt, and they and they left Egypt. And then they came down here into this wilderness area. And once they got here, they sent 12 spies up here into Canaan, to check out the land and come back with a report because that was the land that God told them was going to be there so that they were supposed to go and take well, when they sent the 12, spies, they came back with a report. And all 12 of the spies all had the same thing to say about the quality of the land. And they said that it was prime real estate, it was fantastic. They brought back some goods from the land that included a cluster of grapes that was so large, I had to be carried by two people, they describe the land is flowing with milk and honey, this was of the place if you're looking for shopping around looking for a place to live, this was it.

Unknown Speaker  02:19
However, living in that place, were some pretty big people. This was a place with very fortified cities, great big walls, strong armies, well defended. This is a place where there were descendants of the Nephilim were told and think of the Nephilim think of giants kind of like Goliath. And so some of them were somewhere in the land as well. And the 10 spies said, We just felt like grasshoppers, and they said, it's impossible. Yeah, I know, Moses, you said that we're gonna go and take that land. But it's not possible. You don't know you haven't seen these people know, the 12 spies are actually two that came back and said, You know what, yeah, it's heavily fortified. There's a lot of big people, but we can take it because God said he's gonna give it to us. That was Joshua, and Caleb. Well, unfortunately, the voice of the tin ended up persuading the rest of that group. And they were so persuasive, in fact that they even at some point suggested that they overthrow Moses and the leadership and silence anyone who was still saying that they should go and take that land, because they saw it as a fool's errand. They even threatened to kill those who were saying that they should take the land, appoint a new leader in Moses place who would take them back to Egypt, this was a very bright group. So as punishment for this and further faithlessness, God made that nation stay here in this wilderness area, and they stayed down there for about 40 years, and that they were there until most of that generation that rebelled against God, most of that generation has had died. And so after that 40 year period, though, it was time to start again, you had a pretty much a fresh group of people who were who were ready to comply with what God had told them. And so it was time to make the march up out of the wilderness. And what they did was they came north up here, and they came along the east side of the Dead Sea and started making some progress. So they're on the east side of the Jordan. In fact, while they're under Moses's leadership under his watch, they were able to go ahead and conquer that land that was east of the Jordan. However, that was as far as Moses could take them because Moses had also received some discipline, and part of that was that he was not allowed to enter Canaan. He was not allowed to cross West over the Jordan into the land. He was allowed to see it. and not actually enter. So Moses forbidden from crossing the Jordan and also being very old and age at this point, passed leadership on to Joshua. And so

Unknown Speaker  05:12
the first so what I want to say tonight, I guess the first point that I would make, in terms of, of what they went through, and also things that we can see that would apply to us as well is that during this time, there were some words that were repeated several times, and we just sang them. Those words are Be strong and courageous. Those words were first actually spoken to Deuteronomy at that point where Moses was passing leadership on to Joshua, Moses said those words twice, he said, it wants to the people be strong and courageous. And he said it wants to Joshua, because both of them would need it. All of them knew that the task that the time had come for them to face this, these giants in this impossible seeming mission of taking over Canaan and inhabiting that land. And so the people would have been nervous and afraid. And Joshua was about to be appointed leader and Moses's shoes, and he would have been nervous and possibly afraid about that. And so these words are spoken by Moses to both be strong and courageous. And then after Joshua is appointed leader, God speaks to Joshua. And these words are repeated yet again. In fact, I'm going to read these if you want to turn and read along. I'm going to read it from Joshua, the first chapter, Joshua, chapter one, I'm going to read the first nine verses and pay attention to to how these words are used to encourage Joshua at this time as he becomes leader, Joshua chapter one, verse one says, After the death of Moses, the servant of the Lord, the Lord said to Joshua, the son of Nun, Moses, his assistant, Moses, my servant is dead. Now therefore rise go over this, Jordan, you and all this people into the land that I'm giving them to the people of Israel, every place that the soul of your foot will tread upon I have given you, just as I promised Moses, from the wilderness, and this Lebanon as far as the great river, the river Euphrates and all the land of the Hittites to the great sea towards the going down to the sun shall be your territory. No man shall be able to stand before you all the days of your life, just as I was with Moses, so I will be with you, I will not leave you or forsake you. Be strong and courageous for you shall cause these people to inherit the land that I swore to their fathers to give them only be strong and very courageous. Be careful to do according to all the law of Moses, my sermon commanded you do not turn from it to the right hand or to the left, that you may have good success wherever you go, this book of the law should not depart from your mouth, but you shall meditate on a day and night, so that you may be careful to do according to all that is written in it. For then you will make your way as prosperous and when you in when you will have good success. Have I not commanded you be strong and courageous, do not be frightened, and do not be dismayed. For the Lord your God is with you wherever you go. And then it's actually mentioned again, so after the Lord says it three times there to Joshua, you think he's trying to get a point across? It's also mentioned one more time down. Near the end of the first chapter, I'm going to read verses 16 through 18. And here, it's not the Lord who says, who's speaking the words, but as the people who now have a new leader and they are speaking these words to Joshua says, they're in verse 16, chapter one, and the answer Joshua, all that you have commanded us we will do and wherever you send us, we will go just as we obeyed Moses and all things so we will obey you. Only may the Lord your God be with you as He was with Moses, whoever rebels against your commandment and disobey use your words, whatever you command down, shall be put to death. Only Be strong and courageous. These words are spoken to this group of sojourners, who are preparing to wage war against a well fortified land. And this newly appointed appointed leader of Joshua, as well as the people would need strength and courage as they attempt to place their trust in God and go on this mission to conquer this land. Imagine how scary this would be how terrifying this would be. This was a task that terrified there, the generation before them so much that they wouldn't even consider it. It seems like it seemed like a fool's errand. And yet here, they are about to actually do this. And so these words would have been used to give them encouragement. The enemy in this place was large. The lands you know, the walls were thick, the armies were large and well equipped and well trained. They didn't know as they were preparing to enter the land. Keep in mind, they had no idea how they were going to take the land. They had no idea how they were going to win these battles. So they're going into this completely on faith that God is going to give them victory when they don't know how to achieve that victory. And so the first stop, that they were going to make on their way in into this land was Jericho. And we all know that Jericho had those walls, and they would have no idea how to how to actually get inside those walls and tear them down. And then after they get past Jericho, then there's AI and then and then there's this place called Gibbon, which was even bigger and stronger with this incredibly strong army. That was there, there were over 30 kings, and armies in this land that they would have to deal with on their way in. So when they say the words Be strong and courageous, it would be to encourage each other as they both fair that is, they both face down an impossible task or seemingly impossible task. But they are saying this to encourage faith in God to encourage trust in God as they go into this together.

Unknown Speaker  11:02
You know, Joshua, when he would say to the people, he would say, trust God to give us this victory. The people when they would say it to Joshua, are saying, Joshua, we're with you, so long as you trust God, and follow God into this and how encouraging that would be, you know, it is. Sometimes we all go through things together. And we're all kind of on equal playing ground where we're not quite sure how something's going to work out. And isn't it great that we can say encouraging words to each other words like this, maybe it's not exact words, Be strong and courageous, but something along the lines of find your courage, trust God, God will get you through this, we're in this together, we're all gonna trust God, we're all gonna get through this, right? Words like that are very encouraging and very helpful in a lot of situations, especially when we feel like we don't have control, or we don't have the answers on how everything is going to work out. Well, the next time we see these words, in Joshua, it's actually a few chapters later, and that's in chapter 10. So in chapter 10, and verse 24, a lot is passed. A lot of big battles have already been won. Jericho has been won in here. Most recently, they were engaged in the battle of Gideon, which was a pretty intense battle we'll talk about in a few minutes. But kind of near the end of this battle of Gideon, when things have gone in their in their favor. And the victory is almost there's Joshua says these words again, Joshua, chapter 10, starting in verse 24. And when they brought those kings out to Joshua, Joshua summoned all the men of Israel and said to the chiefs of the men of war, who had gone with him, come near, put your feet on the necks of these kings, than they came near and put their feet on their necks. And Josh was said to them, Do not be afraid or dismayed, Be strong and courageous, for thus the Lord will do to all your enemies against whom you fight.

Unknown Speaker  13:03
What I like about it being spoken here is a lot of the big battles have already been won. At this point, they've been through a great deal. And yet Joshua is again saying the same words. But for me, when he says them here, they carry a different weight, a slightly different meaning. Because now, it's not put your trust in God. And to get us through this, even though we don't know how it's going to happen. Instead. Now, it's almost like a bookend when he says, Remember when we would say these words to encourage each other before this all started? Now look at you, you've got your feet on the necks of Five Kings that we just defeated in battle. Put your trust in God Be strong and courageous. It's almost as if he's saying, See, see what happens when you're strong and courageous. See what happens when you put your trust in God, there is victory when you do that. And there's something different about hearing those words from someone who's been through a lot, who's exercised that faith and trust and come out on the other side, then someone who hasn't yet gone through that. And I say that because it makes me think about when someone who has gone through some sort of a trial gives encouragement to someone who was starting to go through a trial of that sort for the first time. And they're able to offer encouragement to say, yeah, we've been there. I can remember years ago is probably around 15 years ago, back back when we were kind of making a change in our lives and and we were going from the double income, no kids dinks we're going from being dings to considering you know, having a kid and do we give up one of those incomes so that we can have you know, a parent, stay at home, have a stay at home mom in the house to raise those kids and we're kind of wrestling with that because when you're used to having two incomes, no kids and now you're Talking about having your income and now you got more to pay for, it can be scary. And even though you know what you want to do, your fear can almost paralyze you and keep you from making a decision. Well, I remember at the time talking to a couple who were probably about 15 years older than us. And they were kind of on the opposite end of this where their kids were older, and they've been through a lot. And I remember them, listening to us express our concerns, and then just be kind of very gently saying, We know where you are. We've been there, we decided to put our trust in God that that was the right thing to do, even though we had no idea how we were going to be able to afford to do that. And yet, here we are, all these years later, we're on the other side. And all they could tell us was trust God, don't worry about it, God will take care of you. If that is the right thing to do, then do it. And God will take care of you some of the best advice that I've never forgotten, and hearing it come from people who have been through exactly what we were about to go through just meant that much more. So here, when I read Be strong and courageous, it just carries a different weight for me. And so I would encourage you, if you've been through a tough time, and you see someone else about to go through it. These are great words of encouragement, even if you're not saying these exact words, something to say trust God, he'll get you through like he got me through is very meaningful, very impactful. So be strong and courageous is the first point that we're making tonight. The second point that I want to make tonight, is be committed. So this Israelite army, once they've made it up here, and they're on the Whoopsie, I lost my map. Remember, it was over here, they're on the east side of the Jordan, they were getting ready to cross the Jordan for the first time, but they had already conquered that land that was on the east side. So I think there could have been a temptation at that point for them to say, you know, what, we've got land, we all fit here, our wives, our family, our livestock, we're all here. Why don't we just be content to stay here? Do we really need across the Jordan Do we really need to put ourselves through all of that, where we've already got something better than what we had in the wilderness, and it would have been made possibly a temptation to just stay put and stop making progress. So I think that, you know, they could have come up with really several excuses other than just the fact that they, their wives and family were there, it could be that they just got distracted by the time they've made it up to that stretch of land. And at that point, because they're sitting on land, it could be that they're just now starting to switch focus to well, you know, I really like to build a house, I like to settle down, I'd like to start growing some crops, I'd like to start increasing my livestock. And I can do all of that right now here in this land. And it would be easy to get distracted and lose sight of God's purposes. You know, because they're starting to shift focus over to their own goals and their own purposes. But they couldn't do that they

Unknown Speaker  18:01
had to keep making progress and stay committed to the task that had been set before them. They couldn't let fear paralyze them and prevent them from going like we talked about. So they had to find a way to put all of those types of thoughts aside and not let them distract them from the mission at hand and to keep making progress. So God gives them a goal. And they've got to stick to that goal until it's completed. Not only could they not just stop in the land, to the east of the Jordan, but even worse, they couldn't turn around and go back and just leave it all completely. And that could have still been a temptation for these people. We know that the Israelites, especially the generation before them, had wanted to go back to Egypt, and they were griping and complaining and they got punished for that it could have still been a temptation for this crew, to say, You know what, I don't want to cross the Jordan, let's just go let's just go back, let's go far away from here so that we don't have to fight these battles. But they can't do that they have to proceed. There also could have been a temptation to just flat out abandoned God at this point. And so, you know, following God was not easy. I think sometimes those of us in this room it can be, it may seem hard, but compared to what they had to go through at times, they had to go through some hard times and following God was not an easy thing to do. And so they are literally being asked to put their lives in his hands and go out and do something that seems impossible. And it could have been that they just said, You know what, we don't want any more of this. We don't want to serve this God anymore. We don't we don't care about his plans anymore. We're just gonna go abandon him completely and go do our own thing. And that would have been a complete turn away from God. But we know that they had to fight that they had to fight that mentality all through their history. In fact, in the end of Joshua, I'm going to skip ahead little bit in the end of Joshua, we actually see one of his more famous quotes from the book. Joshua chapter 24. I'm going to read starting in verse 14, says, Now therefore, fear the Lord and serve Him in sincerity and in faithfulness, put away that God's that your father served beyond the river and in Egypt, and serve the Lord. And if it is evil in your eyes, to serve the Lord, choose this day whom you will serve, whether the gods or father served in the region beyond the river, or the gods of the Amorites, in whose land you dwell. But as for me, in my house, we will serve the Lord. And then the people answered, Far be it from us that we should forsake the LORD to serve other gods, for it as the Lord or God who brought us and our fathers out from the land of Egypt, and, and out of the house of slavery, and who did those great signs in our side and preserved us in all the way that we went, and among all the peoples through whom we passed, and the Lord drove out before us, all the peoples, the Amorites, who lived in the land, therefore, we also will serve the Lord, for He is our God. And so it's really great to see here, this commitment that they make before entering into such a task. And we know that, that this sort of thing was kind of a plague for them, that they were constantly tempted throughout their history to turn away from God. But right here, this moment, when they needed to be committed, they were committed, they were committed to God, and they were committed to the task that God had given them. So part of part of being committed is to keep making forward progress. And then part of it, I would say, I'm going to say is that they can't leave the enemy in the territory. So as they were going to go into this territory, there were clear instructions that were given. God gave instructions to remove all of the inhabitants, so no inhabitants should be spared. They weren't allowed to intermarry with anybody that was there, they had to just completely purify that land. The reason for that is because God knew that the idolatry that was practiced their lives in the hearts of the people that was there, if allowed to stay would eventually affect the hearts of the nation that he's been working so hard for, and that it would corrupt their hearts, and that they would eventually turn away from Him and betray him to serve another god and idol. But they had to, to, you know, try to cut that off and make sure that that that doesn't happen in Joshua 24. Again, starting in verse 19. So but Josh was said to the people, you are not able to serve the Lord, for he is a holy God, he's a jealous God, he will not forgive your transgression of your sins. If you forsake the LORD and serve foreign gods, then he will turn into harm and consume you. After having done you good. All right. So there's some firm warning that comes out, don't just purify the land, but make sure you're guarding your hearts, make sure that you don't transgress God,

Unknown Speaker  22:57
don't leave the enemy, purify. Right. So based on some of these things that we were just talking about, I think there's some applications that we can see, to make in our own lives. First of all, we talked about making progress. Well, if you're gonna make progress, one application, I'd say is that you got to be willing to get out of your comfort zone, and take action. And even to the point of risking your life, which is something that honestly, we're just not used to, I think it'd be very difficult if the day comes when we're put in that in that position. But we have to be mentally prepared, that we are willing to go to that, to that extent that we were willing to completely give our lives over to him and be willing to be uncomfortable and do things that we're not typically comfortable with. Also, I'd say to keep making progress. There's something to say about Bible study here. When I say keep making progress. I think when it comes to studying our Bibles, it's so easy to reach a point where we say, You know what, I know enough, I've got enough figured out, and I don't really want to keep studying anymore. Instead, I just want to tell everybody what I already know. And that's it. But I think there's there's a danger in that mindset. I think there's instead value and having the willingness to continually renew, take a fresh look at the Bible and continually studying it, looking for something maybe that you've missed, or you know, maybe you've had a different perspective, and now you read it and it changes your perspective. You know, I would just say never reach a point where you feel like you know, enough because you'll never know enough. You'll never know everything. You'll never have that perfect perspective. You want to keep searching. You want to keep digging, and never let your Bible study become stale in that way because if you do, you'll stop making progress. I would also say that you got to be careful not to turn back. There are unfortunately, a lot of people who make the decision to be a Christian and follow After Christ and follow after God, who later on, maybe right away, or maybe much further down the road, make that decision to just completely turn away from it and abandon it. You see everyone from someone who's who's a new Christian to someone who has been an elder for a number of years, who, for different reasons, decide to walk away and just abandon God and abandon everything that they had been taught up to that point. And that's so dangerous. And I would say that it's something that we all have to be on alert, for, we all have to watch for and guard against. So we too have to choose this day who we will serve, and remain committed. And that is something we have to choose every day, every day, at every moment, you have to make that choice to remain committed to God, because as soon as you're no longer purposefully, staying committed to God, it's so easy to lose your way, it's so easy to either get stagnant to where you're no longer growing, or just lose your way entirely, and walk away. The other point I guess I'd make is just as they weren't allowed to leave the enemy and their territory, you're not allowed to leave the enemy in your territory, either. And so God knew that allowing idols and idol worshipers to remain among the nation with turn their hearts away. And in just the same way, we have to be in the world, not of the world. And while certainly we're exposed to things that are against God, certainly there's we can't completely sterilize our environment where we're not around that. But we have to be cautious about the things that we allow into our lives. Because if those things can turn our hearts, they can turn us away from God. So we just got to be extra cautious to make sure that we don't allow things in that will that will distract us that will stop our growth, or that'll turn us away from God. All right. Second point was be committed. Last point that we're going to talk about tonight, is make sure that we give God the glory. So when, when they actually crossed the Jordan, and enter the land, there's a lot of victories that are won there. And it could have been, that the people who are out fighting the wars, took victory, you know, claim a victory for themselves and look what we accomplished, look what we did as the people. But when you actually looking at what has done, you see that it's ludicrous that they would try to take claim of victory in these circumstances. First of all, when they go across, they go into Jericho, they have a conversation to two people kind of sneak into Jericho and have a conversation with rehab. And rehab, lets them know something that I that I thought was really interesting.

Unknown Speaker  27:51
In Joshua chapter two, Joshua chapter two and verse eight. It says, Before the men lay down, she which is Rahab, came up to them on the roof and said to the men, I know that the Lord has given you the land, and that the fear of you has fallen upon us and that all the inhabitants of the land melt away before you. For we have heard how the Lord dried up the water of the Red Sea before you when you came into Egypt and what you did to the two kings of the Amorites, who were beyond the Jordan, to Saigon and Og, whom you devote it to disruption. And as soon as we heard it, our hearts melted and there was no spirit left in any man because of you, for the Lord your God. He is the God in the heavens above and on the earth beneath. This is the idolatrous nation that's about to be wiped out. And here they find out that this nation fears God, they're terrified of this. This group of sojourners who have been wandering around in a desert for 40 years have terrified of them, not because the men are so great, but because they've heard of God. They've heard what he's done. They heard what he did to the Red Sea and what he's accomplished with this with this, I'm sure weak army so far, and it terrifies them. And how in the world would this group of men claimed victory for instilling that kind of fear in the army, they couldn't clearly it was God who this group of people was afraid of. Secondly, I'd say that when you look at the different battles that are that are fought, and there's a few that are fought here in this book of Joshua, it's so obvious that they would not have been one if God was not helping them along the way. In fact, if you remember the very first battle that took place was Jericho. And and no one could deny that it was God who broke down the walls of Jericho and allowed the armies to enter and have victory there. Have mentioned a couple of times the Battle of Gibby and I actually want to read a little bit about the Battle of Gideon, which is mentioned in Joshua Chapter 10. I think this is a fascinating, a fascinating battle that takes place. You got this, this group in just the worst of circumstances going up against these five armies. They really should have no chance. But in Joshua Chapter 10 Verse starting in verse six, it says, In the men of giving center, Joshua at the camp and Gail Gail, saying, do not relax your hand from Your servants come up to us quickly and save us and help us for all the kings of the Amorites, who dwell in the hill country are gathered against us. So Joshua went up from Gilgal, he and all the people of war with him and all the mighty men of valor. And the Lord said to Joshua, do not fear them, for I have given them into your hands, not a man of them shall stand before you. So Joshua came up upon them suddenly, having marched all night from Gilgal. And the Lord's threw them in a panic before Israel, who struck them with a great blow at Gibbon, and chase them away by the ascent of Beth Warren, instruct them as far as the Zika. And in Macedon. And as they fled before Israel, while they were going down the ascent of Beth horn, the Lord threw down large hailstones from heaven on them, as far as Zika, and they died. There were more who died because of the hailstones and the sons of Israel killed with a sword. And at that time, Josh was spoke to the Lord in the day when the Lord gave the Amorites over to the sons of Israel. And he said, in the side of Israel, son stands still at Gideon and moon in the valley of a giant lawn, and the sun stood still and the moon stopped until the nation took vengeance on the enemies. Is this not written in the Book of just char, the sun stopped in the midst of heaven, it did not hurry to set for about a whole day. There has been no day like it before or since when the Lord hated the voice of the man for the Lord Fahd. Israel. Okay. What we have here is you have an army, who marches all night to go engage in a battle against five well rested, well equipped and well trained armies. I think before the battle even began, they had already lost, right? I don't know if you've ever been up all night that I'm worthless in the morning when I pulled an all nighter, right? And yet, here they are after marching all night, and they have to enter into this battle. Well, God steps in and what he does is he causes panic, in the Five Armies, they break formation and they start to run away. And the Israelite army just chases them down and does their job. More than that, God reigns big hailstorm, hailstones down on them in kills more than the army did with swords. Right. And then not only that, but after the day when the sun was was, I guess, about to set.

Unknown Speaker  32:53
God stopped the sun in the sky for the length of another day, so that the battle could continue and the enemy couldn't get away. So think about this now and army marches all night. They're already inferior. They marched all night. They battle all day. And then the sun stays still so that they can battle another day and finish the job. Do you think that army won on their own skill? No way. It's not happening. These guys. It's amazing. They're still standing and holding their swords. There's no way they won this victory. I gotta tell you, I'm impressed with them. I really am. I don't know if I could have done that. I would have been kicked out of that army. But regardless, they would have been wiped off the map if God had not stepped in and won this for them. Man could not take the credit. It's impossible. In Joshua 24, again, starting in verse 11, says, and you went over the Jordan and came to Jericho and the leaders of Jericho fought against you, and also the Amorites and the parasites, the Canaanites, the Hittites, the Gurkha Shiites, the Hittites and the Jebusites. And I gave them into your hands. And I sent the Hornet before you which drove them out before you the two kings of the Amorites. It was not by your sword or by your bow, I gave you a land which you had not labored and cities that you had not built, and you dwell on them. You eat the fruit of vineyards, and olive orchards, all of orchards that you did not plant. Again, they had no basis to make a claim that they were there in Canaan, because they are out such mighty warriors defeating impossible. So that kind of makes me ask this question. If there was no way they could win on their own mind, then why make them fight at all? Right? If God was able to kill more with hailstorm hailstones than they were with swords in that one battle, why not just have them cross over the Jordan if God had already taken care of it, why make these men go and do this work? Well, I guess some thoughts that I would have on that is Is that he did it to test them. James one, verse three, we read testing of your faith produces endurance. And endurance is something that this group needed. They needed to build endurance in their faithfulness to God so that they would remain faithful, even after this conquering business was over, and finished. Also, I would say that it's to build character. Character is built during hard times, not easy times. And God wasn't just making good on a promise to Abraham by providing the land, he was trying to raise a nation he was building character among the people of this nation. He was reconditioning the men to make them loyal and trusting and faithful servants of character building was, I think, a big part of this. And also, I would say, that he had men do this to show the man that God can be trusted and will fight for them, you know, faith, or trust, needs to be strengthened, and the only way to strengthen it is to exercise it very much like muscles. And so it took faith for Israel to walk around the walls of Jericho. But it would have been easy to doubt God and wonder if marching in circles wasn't a waste of their time. But once those walls came tumbling down, they would have had a surge of faith as they saw that their faith was rewarded and vindicated. Right, so the next battle that they enter, they would enter in with greater faith and greater confidence, and so on and so forth. And so with every battle that they went through, every time they saw God, step in and win for them, fight with them, their faith would have increased. And so this would have been a faith building exercise for them. So let's talk about some applications that we can make from all of that, and then this lesson will be done.

Unknown Speaker  37:01
One application that I would make for us is that God should be given the glory, whenever there's a victory, it's so easy to be focused on what we're doing, that we lose sight of what God is doing. And when things are going well, or when we get through a challenging time, we need to remember to stop and thank God for whatever he's done. Now, God was very visibly active during some of these wars, and it would have been evil easy to say, here's exactly what God did to help us achieve victory. For us. It's not always that easy. We have no idea what's going on behind the scenes, what God has done for us to help pave our way or to make sure that things work out the way that we need them to. But just the same, I have full confidence that God is doing that for each and every one of us. And so it would be foolish not to stop and thank God for all of the things that he does for us in our lives. Can you imagine how insulting it would have been for that weak and tired army to claim victory for themselves at Gibson, and not recognize that God had handed them that victory, just the same, it would be foolish of us and insulting for us not to stop and give God thanks for everything that he's doing for us, even if we don't know what all that is. Also, besides just giving God the glory for the victory, I'd say that we need to recognize that there is value in the struggle. It's easy to complain when we're going through hard times, very easy. But I would say, don't complain about being tested. It's not uncommon for God to test man, we're all tested. And that testing produces endurance in us just like it would. And, and it helps us in the long run to remain faithful, that periodic testing is actually good for us in the long run, you have to remember the big picture and the big picture testing is very good. If you look back on your life, I think we could I think we can all agree that the times that we've had the most the best growth spurts in terms of growing and maturity would be during those times of testing during those most challenging and difficult times. That's when our characters really grows and is refined. And that is the time in our lives when I think we can look back and be most thankful for at least the results. If we're not thankful for the hard time we can at least be thankful for the results that come from going through such difficult circumstances. I would say that, you know, your faith will grow stronger, the more you use it. And so, if all you have right now is a mustard seed of faith planted, you know, plant it and let it grow. Learn to trust God in the little things because if you can't learn to trust God in the little things, your faith will never grow to a point that you can trust God in the big things. And what bigger thing is there than your salvation? If you can't trust God in minor day to day things? How can you trust God to save your soul? Trust God in all things, but strengthen that faith muscle, trust Him in everything, every opportunity you have, use it. Well, that is the lesson. And so I hope tonight that after talking about these things that you can see that it was, it was very challenging for them, but very rewarding for them. And I think that there are clear applications that we can make to our own lives as well that we can be strong and courageous, that we can be committed, and we can give God the glory. So I hope that was time well spent. So at this point, we'd like to take a moment to offer an invitation. And we offer an invitation to people who are going through hard times and need to ask for prayer requests, and we just want to make that known in a public way. And we offer the invitation as a time for people who want to become Christians to make that known and we can assist you with that. Right now. We're going to sing a song if you need to make any request known. You can come down front as we sing, and we'll sing that song right now. Please stand and sing
