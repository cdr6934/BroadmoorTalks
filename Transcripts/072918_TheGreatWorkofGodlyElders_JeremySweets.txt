Good evening. It's good to see everyone here tonight. Certainly good that we can gather together to study God's Word. This year, we've been looking at the theme of faithful stewards, faithful stewards. That's a little grayed out. But that's a picture of a man and a steward and a field that is working for his master. And we focus on the fact that we are servants of our Lord, who is our master. This month, we've been reading through scriptures that are related to shepherds and elders. Trevor does a good job of putting the scripture readings together. And this month he focused on that theme. And so you asked, you know, how can you preach twice in one day? Well, I copied all my answers from Trevor for tonight's sermon. So we're going to look at those passages that talk about elders.

Jeremy Sweets  00:55
Tonight, and I'd like to look at the great work of godly elders, the great work of godly elders, it certainly is a great work to do and to be done. The Lord gave the church elders and deacons for its benefit for the proper working and functioning of the church. God saw the need for elders. And I believe that we need to see the need for elders today as well. I have Hebrews 13 as a main text, but we'll look at some of these and I didn't go in the same order as Trevor so I group these a little bit differently. But in these first three passages, I think we see the great need that exists for elders. First of all, Hebrews chapter 13, verse good, particularly in verse 17, of that passage, it says, Obey your leaders and submit submit to them, for they are keeping watch over your souls, as those who will, who will have to give an account, let them do this with joy, and not with groaning for that would be of no advantage to you. There are a lot of stewards in the world. There are men that look after people's money. There are people that look after people's houses with insurance and different things like that. There are people that look after storefronts. There are many stewards here in our country that that have that job. But notice the stewardship that elders have, they are to keep watch over your souls. Now, everything that I mentioned before this, you can put a value to catch a house, a storefront, property, possessions, all of that. But here the tech says that elders the leaders are keeping watch over your souls, help you see what a great need there is for that job. What a important work it is to do to keep watch over souls. And so leaders are charged with the elders of a congregation. And Acts chapter 20, we see that Paul gives an address to the Ephesian elders. In verse 28. He says pay a careful attention to yourselves and to all the flock in which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers to care for the church of God which he obtained with his own blood. Elders, it says first of all, are to pay attention to themselves. I'm making that a general comment Paul says specifically to the Ephesian elders pay attention to yourselves and to all the flock in which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers. Elders must be men that pay attention. They pay attention first of all to themselves and take regard to themselves in regards to godliness, and godly living and sin, making sure that they are not living in sin. But not only that, but it says to the flock, says the flock in which the Holy Spirit has made you overseers. We say the importance of elders and what God has chosen for the church. He has chosen elders and it says that he has placed them or made them overseers. This is to care for the Church of God, a very precious entity indeed, one that that Jesus shed his own blood for God shed His own blood for. So the elders here it says must be those that care for the Church of God. It is a great need and a great work to be done. In First Peter chapter five, in verses two and three, there is a shepherd the flock of God that has among you, exercising oversight, not under compulsion, but willingly as God would have you. Not for shameful gain, but eagerly, not domineering over those in your charge but being examples to the flock. Here the image is of shepherding. Now you've seen a shepherd Word out in a field are seeing pictures of that, where a shepherd has charged over all the difference. Normally you'll see sheep or something like that. A lot of times they'll want to graze or wander or scatter. And the shepherd is in charge over making sure that they are together and that they are safe. Here, Peter, he says to his fellow elders, he says, shepherd the flock of God that is among you, exercising oversight, not under compulsion, but willingly, this oversight is to be a work of service, not one of a power move, not one of compulsion, where they are compelled both to do this,

Jeremy Sweets  05:42
outside of their own will, or in which they would compel others to act according to their will. Not in a domineering fashion, but rather, they are to shepherd the flock of God. They are to do this with great joy. As we look at all these passages, I think we see that there is a great need for elders because they are in charge of but they are watching over people's souls. What a great work that is, what a needed work that is. Now I didn't start off with this, but I should have, we have three men here that serve as elders, you probably, especially if you're a member here, you know that right, so Mike Roy, Norma harbor, and Curtis Byers all serve here. But as I look out here, I see a lot more men of different ages. And so I just hope that there are more than just three men that I'm talking to tonight, there are many men that are thinking about this. There are many boys that are thinking about this middle age, young men, middle age, and even those that are older and could be thinking about being qualified there. This is a great work that is needed. And I hope it's something the congregation is interested in not just a select few. It is a great need. Second of all, we see that there is a great preparation involved. And so just as I mentioned that there are many men here that should be thinking about this, this is something that doesn't happen overnight. You don't all of a sudden say I would like to become an elder, but rather it takes great preparation and work really to develop your Christian character in First Timothy chapter three verses one through 13. And also in Titus, one, five through 11. We see and I'm not going to read all of that text, but we see different qualities or characteristics that are needed of men that would be qualified to serve in that work. There's many ways to group those. This is one way it shows qualities of moral character, moral character, elders must be men that have a moral character. They are sober minded, self controlled, not a lover of money. They're not arrogant or a drunkard. They're a lover of good. They are upright, and holy. They display qualities of leadership. That would include being a husband of one wife, having believing children and managing their household well. They are respectable, hospitable and able to teach. They are not violent, but gentle. They're not quarrelsome. Not only that, they have qualities of a moral character and show qualities of leadership, but they show qualities of spiritual maturity. They are not a new convert. The text says and Titus, that they hold firm to the trustworthy word, they're able to silence false teachers and those that disrupt and want to harm the flock. They are disciplined. Now, again, those aren't all in that order. But if we can think about those groupings or qualities of, of men, that would be elders, they must be moral, they must lead and they must have a spiritual maturity, that preparation and developing that kind of character is needed because of the great work to do. Watching over people's souls, teaching what is true, helping others see the importance of godliness. The Bible says in I've read all these passages, there's somewhat in my head, I want to say Hebrews, the Hebrews 13 passage, it starts off with that you're to imitate their work of their you know what, I'm going to try to go there because I think it is Hebrews 13, mostly verse seven. I was impressed with the way it said it even though you couldn't tell from how I tried to spit that out. Hebrews 13 And verse seven

Jeremy Sweets  10:00
Remember your leaders, those who spoke to you the Word of God. And this is the phrase that impressed me consider the outcome of their way of life, and imitate their faith, their way of life, the outcome of their way of life. This shows that this is not something that happens again, just in one day. But this is a process of building and developing character. And you can see this in their way of life. Now, those that submit to elders are to it says, to consider their way of life and imitate their faith. And so we see the importance of what elders are doing, not just when they are appointed, but in that their entire lives up to that point, developing the kind of character that is needed to watch over people's souls. And so there is a time of great preparation to be an elder. Not only that, but several of the passages that that Trevor looked at, talk about shepherds in the Old Testament, and you can see the great harm of those that were godless shepherds. And impart I know it's not talking about elders and the true sense of that, but as you look at how they failed, I think you see a lot of what was expected of them and what is needed of, of really elders today, and Ezekiel chapter 22. zekiel 22, in verses 26 and 27. It says her priests have done violence to my law, and have profaned My holy things. They have made no distinction between the holy and the common, neither have they taught the difference between the unclean and the clean, and they have disregarded my silence so that I am profaned among them. Her Prince is in her midst are like wolves tearing the prey, shedding blood destroying lives to get this on this game. Here we see the shepherds are the leaders in Israel were men that had no concern for the flock, they were more concerned for themselves. And at the end, you see this on this game, even if that were to harm the flock. They did this by ignoring or this regarding God's law and his word. They made no distinction between what was common and uncommon, or holy and profane.

Jeremy Sweets  12:31
Elders today need to practice what these people did not. They need to be teachers of the word. They need to be able to distinguish between what is holy and given to God and what is profane. The Bible also says in the New Testament, in qualifications that they are not to be lovers of money. Unlike the men in Ezekiel chapter 22, who were giving up their their task in order to get game elders are not to be focused on what they can get out of it. It is not a matter of prestige and honor to do that is not a title to be worn in that regard. It is a work of service, and it is a work of service that takes great sacrifice, great sacrifice. And so we see the great harm that was done by the godless elders in Ezekiel 22. Also in chapter 34, Ezekiel, chapter 34, we see more descriptions of those elders that were derelict in their duty. They were ignoring God and His Word, they were allowing the sheep it says to be scattered, to be scattered. And so we see that they were not watching as they should. They were not taking care to look at the sheep that were there. In Jeremiah Chapter Two, and verse eight. There it says the priests did not say where is the Lord? Those who handle the law did not know me. The shepherds transgressed against me, the prophets prophesied by bale and went after things that do not profit. Here the shepherds failed to point people to God. They also were ones that did not know the Lord. Elders today need to be men that first of all know God themselves, and are seeking to point other people to God. These men failed to know God in Jeremiah chapter 10, in verses 11 through 22, a passage from that and that's what we read tonight, and I didn't get that in there. I missed that on the slides. But it says for the shepherds are stupid and Do not inquire of the Lord. Therefore they have not prospered and all their flock has scattered. The shepherds are ones that are simply not doing their job. They are not going to God for guidance, and they have allowed their flock to be scattered. They have failed at the very thing that they are supposed to be doing. We see this also in Jeremiah 23, in verses one through eight and verse one, it says Woe to the shepherds who destroy and scatter the sheep of my pasture declares the Lord. And verse two, it says you have scattered my flock and have driven them away and you have not attended to them. Notice that the charge is that they are negligent, negligent. Now we began talking about many stewards today, whether it be of a property or a storefront or something like that. What would happen to somebody that was not attending to the things of the store? What if they took their lunch break, or they went off for a time and had nobody watching the store? Oh, what happened? That would be a great problem, wouldn't it? If I own that store, that would not be the person I wasn't working there. They were not attending to the store. Well, here it says of the shepherds that they were negligent in their duty, they did not attend to their flock, they simply allow them to be scattered. Elders today need to be those that are watchful for themselves and for their flock and attending to the work there. Now in Jeremiah, chapter 23, after he talks about the great failure of the shepherds there, he talks about one that would come that would be a righteous branch. He promised that he would be God Himself would be the shepherd that they needed. In verses three and four, it says, Then I will gather the remnant of my flock out of all the countries where I've driven them, and I will bring them back to the fold. And they shall be fruitful and multiply, I will set shepherds over them who will care for them, and they shall fear no more, nor be dismayed, neither shall any be missing the Claire's the Lord. Notice that the charges against the shepherds of that day, the leaders he says they've allowed the people to be scattered. And as they were heading into captivity, that's what happened. They were scattered away from Jerusalem in to captivity. But God says that I will gather the remnants of my flock, I will gather them back, I will be the shepherd that brings them together, and they shall be fruitful. It says and multiply. Not only will God act as a shepherd, but he says that I will appoint shepherds or set shepherds over them who will care for them. Now, presumably, this talks about those leaders that returned from exile. And so you see, the ruble, Ezra, Nehemiah, men like that, that would provide the leadership and care for the people there. But you'll also note that God's people have not been without leaders, even if you think about that, as that goes into the New Testament. God has set desired that leaders would be over congregations to be able to watch over them.

Jeremy Sweets  18:24
And verses five and six, not only their will, where there'll be leaders, but he points to the fact that there will be a righteous branch, there will be one that is coming. That is the Messiah. He says, Behold, the days are coming declares the Lord when I will raise up for David a righteous branch, and He shall reign as king and deal wisely, and shall execute justice and righteousness in the land. In his days Judah will be saved in Israel will dwell securely. And this is the name by which he shall be called the Lord, is our righteousness. Yes, we see that there is great harm that was done by those that did not do what they were supposed to do, by faithless and godless shepherds. And God says that they will be punished for that. And I will be your shepherd and I will point men that will shepherd you as they should. There's a great deal of harm that can happen from from men that are not doing their duty, not watching over souls. And so that's why there needs to be a process in place where they are respected by all by men are put forward by the congregation, while there's a process that takes place where they are vetted, so to speak, so that you can see their character, their character. There's a reason that there are qualifications that there is this time of preparation we see in First Timothy three and Titus chapter one, the work is so great, and so needed, but yet if it's not done in a way where righteousness is put forward, great harm can happen as well. And so we see the importance of good shepherds. And we see that by looking at some Bad Shepherds, particularly in the Old Testament. Not only that, but there is one who is our great example. Not only for those that are elders, but for all Christians, and a zekiel 34 and verse 11. Now, very similar to the Jeremiah 23 passage, it starts off in those first 10 verses, starts off in those verse 10, verses talking about the failure of shepherds. Then we noticed as he gets down to verses 11, through 24, he begins to look forward to a shepherd that would provide something for them. And he starts off with saying that God would be that again, similar to the Jeremiah 23 passage. It says, For thus says the Lord God, Behold, I, I myself will search for my sheep and will seek them out, as a shepherd seeks out his flock when he has among his sheep that have been scattered, so will I seek out my sheep, and I will rescue them from all places where they have been scattered. God says that I arm myself will function as the shepherd that will gather his people together. In the New Testament, and John, we see that Jesus says, I am the good shepherd in verse 11, the good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep. God functions as that shepherd in the Old Testament, but he points for the one who would be the shepherd, the leader of his people, the Messiah, and that is Jesus Christ. There's actually a couple of images that are used in that passage. The first one really, is where he says that in verse seven, that I am the door of the sheep. He is the door of the sheep full. And so he is the way or the access through which the sheep will come. Jesus Christ is the door, he is our access to the Father. Not only that, as I mentioned in verse 11, he is the Good Shepherd, he has access to the Father, but he's also the one that watches over and cares for it says that the good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep. And so you see the importance of the soul, the extent to which the Good Shepherd will go for his sheep, even laying down his own life.

Jeremy Sweets  22:30
In First Peter chapter two, in verses 13 through 25, we see instructions to submit, and many different ways. And then it comes to Jesus Christ, who is our ultimate example, in verses 24 and 25. It says, He Himself bore our sins in his body on the tree, that we might die to sin and live to righteousness, by His wounds you have been healed. For you were straying like sheep, but have now returned to the Shepherd and overseer of your souls. God Almighty is a shepherd. And here we see that Jesus Christ is one that is the shepherd and overseer of your souls. The picture is that we are sheep gone astray. We are in need of a great leader, we listen to the voice of the shepherd and we follow his direction. Jesus Christ gave us the example that we need, and he laid down his life for us. And then finally, in Revelation, chapter five, verses one through 14. There is a question verse two, and Revelation has a lot of vivid imagery as it relays its message. But the question that comes in verse two is that there is a seal and it asks the question, Who is worthy to open the scroll and to break it seal? And verse six, we see the one that is worthy. It says, in between the throne and the four living creatures, and among the elders, I saw a Lamb standing as though it had been slain. And the 24 elders and the four living creatures, it says, they bow down before Him and in verse nine, it says, And they sing a new song, saying, Where Are They are you to take the scroll, and to open it seals for you were slain, and by your blood, you ransom people for God from every tribe and language and people and nation, and you have made them a kingdom of priests star god, and they shall reign on the earth. Then it says that 1000s upon 1000s or myriads fall down and worship the Lord. And in verse 12, it says, Worthy is the Lamb who was slain, to receive power and wealth and wisdom and minds and honor and glory and blessings. As we conclude this thought about this great example found in Jesus Christ, we see that he is the Good Shepherd. But the odd thing or I don't know how to say that the paradox of the matter is that the Good Shepherd Bert is depicted as the Lamb, the sacrificial lamb. He is the one that is to be slaying the question resounds and rings out from heaven who is worthy. And I'm sure there are a lot of looking around, there's no one that is worthy until they see the lamb. The lamb is worthy, and all the living creatures and the elders say the lamb is worthy, worthy Are you and all the 1000s upon 1000s, fall down and worship God and say, the lamb is worth the lamb has died for you? Well, I know this was a very quick summary, didn't get a lot of detail into a lot of different passages. But I hope as we step back and reflect upon our readings, and what we saw, we see that the work of an elder is a great work. Godly men are needed. They're needed at this point, they're needed in the future. And so we need as a congregation to be thinking about this great work of godly elders, to be focused on it, to be thinking about it, to be developing our character so that we can develop men and women that would support those men in a way that will give glory and honor to God. So thanks, Trevor, for the lesson, Smith, was very, very good. Appreciate your work in that. It may be that you're here tonight, and you're not a Christian. If you're not a Christian, you have an opportunity to obey the gospel, believing that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, confessing that Jesus is the Christ, repenting of your sins and turning away from a lifestyle of selfishness and sin, to a lifestyle of service and being baptized in the water for the forgiveness of your sins. When you do that, you're raised to walk in newness of life, having made a lifelong commitment to serve God, you have an opportunity to do that this very night. If you're not a Christian, that's the beck and call and invitation of God Himself. If you're here tonight, and you are a Christian, you're not living as you should. You have this moment right now to make your life ride. I would beg you that if you're in a situation where you're not living as you should, that you would make correction serve God and seek Him this very night. There's any subject to the invitation please come as we stand and sing at this time.
