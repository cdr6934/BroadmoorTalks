Good morning. It's good to see everyone here today. We have a packed house, a lot of people here. And we're glad that you're here. We're glad that you're with us. Our goal at Broadmoor is to give God glory and praise and honor and all that we do both here as we assembled together. But also as we leave here, we seek to teach the truth from God's word. But not only that, to practice it. In fact, Mark talked about our relationships together and that we're not to be to distance. So we have an opportunity this morning, as we sit down, don't we, we're gonna have to rub elbows and be close to one another. So that's, that's a good thing. We're glad that you're here. One of the things I like to do on my way to work is listen to audiobooks. And I'll rent these from the library and check them out. One of the books I read was on Tsar Nicolas Tsar Nicholas, he was the last Russian tsar to exist. In fact, after that, they went to a different style of government. He was deposed in 1917, right in the middle of World War One. One of the things that would it mentioned about him, and the reason that he was generally looked at as a very poor leader is that he did not know his subjects. And so that was seen in many different ways. The military, again, World War One was going on, and Russia was involved in that he wasn't completely aware of the military situation. And so he would go to make a inspection. And the people would, the armies would pull the resources into one group, so that when he looked it looked like they had everything together. The truth is the Russian military, not every person even had a gun or even a bullet to themselves, which is not doesn't make for a good fighting situation. Not only that, but he was one that was shy and reserved, he didn't often leave his powers. In fact, he thought of his people. He thought that they were generally happy. When he looked around, all he saw was wealth and prosperity when he looked in his own little palace there. And he felt like everyone else there was happy. And so there were a lot of riots and revolts, a lot of labor disputes, and he generally had a a poor reaction. And so when we look at Tsar Nicholas, we see that he was not able to consider the situation of others, and that that was on a large and grand scale. He was not able to consider the situation of others. He didn't have empathy, empathy. I like to talk about that for just a few moments this morning. Maybe you've heard a phrase, do not judge a man until you have walked a mile in his shoes. Do not judge a man until you've walked a mile in the shoes. That thing is an adaptation of a phrase taken from a poem by Mary Lathrop, which was written in 1995. And in the poem, she says moccasins instead of shoes, and the first few lines say this. Pray don't find fault with the man that limps or stumbles along the road. Unless you have worn the moccasins he wears or stumbled beneath the same load, there may be tears in his soles that hurt through, though hidden away from view, the burden he bears placed on your back may cause you to stumble and fall to the poem concludes with this line, take the time to walk a mile in his moccasins. So I didn't necessarily align this with Mark class. But I heard a lot of what was said they're talking about relating to others and putting ourselves in their situation.

Jeremy Sweets  04:04
So what we're talking about this morning is empathy. And let me just quickly define that word. Empathy is really a modern word that was coined in the realm of psychology in the early 20th century. And it simply means to place yourself in another person's situation and to consider their point of view. As I mentioned, this was a modern word. So the word itself is not found in Scripture, but I believe the basic principle is, it's wrapped up in the command to love and care for your neighbor. And it's related to other important concepts in Scripture like sympathy or compassion. You may find that similar wording, their sympathy, the pathos deals with the feelings there and so sympathy deals with walking alongside someone. Whereas empathy is almost stepping inside, considering their point of view and their situation. And so I'd like To look at a few ways the Bible talks about having empathy today or walking a mile in someone else's moccasins. Consider, first of all the golden rule in Matthew chapter seven in verse 12. So whatever you wish that others would do to you do also to them. For this is the Law and the Prophets. Notice that empathy stems from a common humanity that we have with one another. How is it that this rule makes sense that we can do for others what we want to do, because we all share something, don't worry, we all share a common humanity, common experiences, we are all made in the image of God, and we all have value. And so we need to consider what other people are thinking. We need to consider where other people are coming from. And I think that will help us respond to them. After all, don't you wouldn't enter a certain way that you want to be treated. Say for example, if you were to rear end somebody, how would you want to be treated? If you were a stranger in a new place? How would you want to be treated? If you recently lost a loved one? How would you want to be treated? See, all these questions force us to address the golden rule, don't they? As we consider what we would want what would be beneficial in the common experiences of life, we need to extend that out to others. Far too often, we only consider what we want. And we stop there, don't we? This is what I want. But the Bible calls us to look to others. Jesus calls for his disciples to consider their own wants and needs from the perspective of the other person. And so extend the same kindness that we would want. We need to walk a mile in another person's moccasins and practice the golden rule. Also say that Paul talks about empathy and unity, particularly when he's talking about the body, the body and First Corinthians chapter 12, and verse 26. There it says, If one member suffers, all suffer together, if one member is honored, all rejoice together. The body has such a closeness together, that the pain that is felt in one member is felt throughout as we step inside their shoes, and consider their pain, and even their joy. In Romans 12 In verse 15, it says, Rejoice with those who rejoice and weep with those who weep. Weep with those who weep. And so we see that as members of the body, there is a key to unity as we practice this empathy or considering other people. It also helps us in other regards, and this is true not only in the body, but outside of the body. But But particularly as we think about the church. Empathy helps us to respond to those in different times in their life, as we mentioned, but also as disagreements arise. Your thought about that, when you get into an argument with someone, the easiest way to keep the argument going is to only consider your point of view, and to be dogmatic about that.

Jeremy Sweets  08:33
But the tensions will dissipate or go down as you begin to consider where they're coming from. Now, that doesn't mean you'll always agree, that doesn't mean the other person's right. Or you're right necessarily all the time. But what that does is change the dynamic doesn't it's from one of competing and winning to one of loving and caring, we must consider their point of view. When you stop to consider where the other person is coming from in their situation, it will help defuse those heated arguments. But not only that, but also maybe it may be the case that you have actually been wrong. How can empathy help in those situations? When we are hurting, it's easy to turn our perspective inside and to be selfish in a sense and self centered. If someone acts ungodly to us, we are considering what we are thinking. And we're not considering the other person. But Jesus says pray for your enemies and those who persecute you those that have done wrong to you. And we need to consider where other people are coming from. I've often heard the phrase that hurt people, hurt people. Those that are hurting often lash out. And if we're only focused on ourselves, we will miss that. Now that's not an excuse for their sin. that's not an excuse for the wrongs that was committed against us. But it does help us to respond to the situation, remembering that we're to pay good for evil and kindness for oppression. What if someone has wronged us and repented? How would you want to be treated in that situation? Would you want to be welcomed back with open arms? Or would you want to be treated as if this more this mark against you will never be forgotten to be brought up whenever there's a need for it? Now, we want to extend kindness to those that have wronged us. And so Empathy helps us be united together, because it helps us step outside her own thoughts, we often have those blinders on and act like Czar Nicholas everyone else must be as happy as I am, or have exactly the situation that I do. But this helps us step outside of ourselves and step into the shoes of another. Not only that, but we need to express sympathy and empathy for those that are down trodden. We mentioned this a little bit with the passage in First Corinthians 12, and Romans 15. There when it says weep with those that we but notice some other examples of this, and Hebrews 13 And verse three, it says, Remember those who are in prison, as though in prison with them, and those who are mistreated, since you also are in the body, and again, another reference to body but notice what it says, Remember those who are in prison as though in prison with them?

Jeremy Sweets  11:43
Consider their situation, consider their difficulty, their distress. This notion is also found all throughout the Old Testament and Exodus chapter 23. And verse nine. It says, You shall not oppress a sojourner, you know the heart of a sojourner for you were sojourners in the land of Egypt. You see what the law was commanding the Israelites there you are to treat with kindness, those that are strangers and sojourners, those that are traveling through why, because you were that soldier, you were that soldier. It says that again, in Deuteronomy 10 And verse 19. Love the sojourner. Therefore, for you were sojourners in the land of Egypt. A couple other passages mentioned this, Deuteronomy 15. And verses 12. Through great team, there are talks about a man that cannot pay his dad and becomes a slave and economic slave to another person. The law says in Deuteronomy 1512, through 18, that you were to release that one after the seventh year. Not only that, but when you let him go, do not let him go empty handed. But give him liberally from your own. It says, from your own flock, your threshing floor, and your wine press. And it says, You shall remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt, and the Lord your God redeemed you, therefore I command you this today, give to him liberally, consider his situation. This is not a situation where you need to make as much money as possible. But there's a genuine concern for the welfare of the other. Also in Deuteronomy 24, verses 17 through 22, it uses that same language. Remember the sojourner because you were a soldier. And it makes reference to when you are, are harvesting your field, leave the corners, for those that are in need. And when you're threshing on the wine press, and gathering the grapes Leave some for those that are there, don't go and try to get every last one, make provision for. And the reason you were to do that is because you were in that situation. And we need to remember others that are in that situation. You know, in this country, there's a couple of competing philosophies about about poverty. One group says that poverty comes because of individuals choices. And this is a pull yourself up by your bootstraps kind of country. And if you want to make it you can make it and if you're not making it that's due to maybe laziness or something like that. There's another group that says no poverty is because of the system that is there and the situations that that are embedded into systems. Well, when we look at Scripture, we don't see either or, we see that there are systems of oppression that can oppress those that are poor. Sometimes, though, we see rebuke of laziness, and poverty can come from that. But what I want to warn us here about is instead of every time we see someone that's poor thinking, That's their fault. That's something they can control instead of thinking that we need to stop for a moment. instead of being quick to judge and step inside their moccasins, we live in a wealthy country. And I say that knowing that there is actually a great disparity, isn't there? Not every single person in this country has a tremendous amount of wealth? There are many that are poor. And so can you imagine what it would be like to be homeless? Can you imagine what it would be like to be without food and to be hungry? Can you put yourself into that situation? That's important because that will affect how we approach others walnuts. If we're only approaching with judgment, we probably never taken a moment to consider their situation and their point of view. So let us practice empathy with the downtrodden. Let us practice empathy, putting ourselves into the situation of another when it comes to sinners. And Luke chapter 18, verses 10 through 13, we see that Jesus tells a parable about a Pharisee and a tax collector. firsthand. It says two men went up into the temple to pray one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector, the Pharisee, standing by himself prayed Thus, God I thank you that I'm not like other men, extortion errs, unjust, adulterers, or even like this tax collector. I fast twice a week I give tithes of all that I get. But the tax collector standing far off with not even lift his eyes to heaven, that beat his breast saying, God be merciful to me a sinner.

Jeremy Sweets  16:43
How often are we that Pharisee? How often do we look at others. Maybe even as we come here, I can't believe people aren't coming to church, or sleeping in or playing games. They're not, they're not even focused on God. Or we look at someone else and say, I can't believe they would act this way. For far too often, we act with this thing, and disregard. And we lump people into that category. We're the good ones. They're the bad ones. And we begin to look down on the bad ones. But that is not the message of Scripture. That is not what God wants us. He wants a humility as we would approach God knowing that we are sinners. Let me use myself as an example here. I know that's a little dangerous in sermons. But I grew up in a loving home. I had two parents that were godly parents. They weren't perfect, but they were sincere and honestly wanted to do what was right. And they tried to teach each one of the kids to do that. And so that was a tremendous advantage. They loved us, they provided an education for us. We were part of a congregation that that loved us. And again, I saw a lot of sincere Christians trying to do what was right. Not in a perfect way. But but honestly trying to do what's right. That's my, that's my vision of Christianity. And I know there are problems with people that don't live up to what they should. But that's what I've seen. Now, let me just ask you a question. Would it be fair for me? And you could go through any stage of life in high school? Maybe in high school? Would it be fair for me to look to my neighbor with this thing? Not knowing their background? Or maybe knowing their background that they didn't have what I had? Would it be fair for me to look to my neighbor that grew up in a single family home with parents that didn't care about them? One parent that says all the time, you're worthless, you're no good? Would it be fair for me to look to another with disdain and disregard? We have a tremendous amount of blessings and opportunities, but we forget that when we look at others, other people should be where I am, we say, or maybe it's a period of growth. You know, it took us 20 years to learn something we look at someone else and say they need to know that right now, because this is the right thing to do. But we need to allow for opportunities to grow. We need to understand our advantages and what we've been given. Be thankful for them, but be understanding with others. We need to practice empathy when it comes to other people. Now, this is not an excuse for sin. Someone that empathizes sees the difficult situation of another could say, well, it's not their fault. They have no control. I'll just let them do as they please. And that's not the command of Scripture either. Scripture calls us to reach out to those that are in need, not with judgment, but with love and compassion. And that's why we see one of the greatest elements of empathy is evangelism. Paul says in first Corinthians nine, verse 22, the week I became weak, that I might win the week, I become all things to all people that by all means I might save some. Paul is not chasing people into their sin, but he is relating to other people and their situation. He is considering where they're coming from, with the goal that he might be able to win those that are hurting, that he might be able to save some when he considers their situation.

Jeremy Sweets  20:59
Paul recognizes the great need for empathy when it comes to evangelism, and spreading the god spreading the gospel. Again, the point is not to make excuses. But God has called us to preach His gospel in love and kindness and compassion. There's only one judge. And none of us here are him. He's not called us to be the executioner to execute His justice and his judgment in that way. But rather, he calls us to gentleness, the passage we looked at this morning in Galatians, chapter six and verse one, you who are spiritual restore such a one with gentleness, with gentleness, in second Timothy two verses 2325, it talks about the Lord's bondservant must not be quarrelsome. And when it talks about correcting the opponents, it says, correct the opponents, with gentleness, with gentleness. And so the goal of Christians first give God our glory, but also spread that to other people, spread His goodness and His kindness to other people. Call them out of their difficulties. The person that grew up with a horrible background may feel a sense that there is no hope in the world, because that's all they've seen. And that's all they've known, but the gospel message says absolutely, there is. And we can share that with them. Not from a pedestal. I'm glad I'm not like you, you should do this. I've heard the statement Mike's repeated I think we've heard it from Joel Plunkett. What preaching is preaching is where one beggar tells another beggar where he got his bread. And they asked, that's the attitude we need to have not have arrogance, and look at me, I'm doing everything right. But we're humble servants. And we're calling other humble servants. The Gospel demands that we would practice empathy within our evangelism as we seek to spread the Gospel. And the book To Kill a Mockingbird. That takes place in a fictional town of Macomb, Alabama in the 1930s. At that time, segregation was the normal way of life and races did not mix. Atticus Finch was a lawyer, and he was assigned to represent a black man who stood accused before the city for a crime against a white woman. Many people felt like because of the color of his skin, he was guilty, and I didn't even feel like a trial should take place or that he should represent them. And let me just even clarify. So this was a time of racism. But prejudice really is timeless. And part of the human condition isn't it exists today. It's what the world wants us to do to rank people. But let me just say that's not what God wants us to do, to put people in order of based on external things. God looks at the heart. God looks at the heart. And that's what we need to do. But Atticus, when he's talking to his daughter, he gives this piece of advice, which I think is very helpful for us to learn from. He says, If you can learn a simple trick scouts, you'll get along a lot better with all kinds of folks. You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of view, until you climb inside of his skin and walk around in it. And you hear that until you consider things from his point of view, until you climb inside of his skin and walk around in it. You know, the enraged whites of that community that didn't feel like a man needed that fair trial. I wonder if that's something they had ever done to consider another person and their situation. Had they ever tried to walk around and another person's skin? I hope you see the importance of why he said skin and not shoes there. It was the skin color that was looked down upon. But he says step inside another person's skin. Walk around in it. Not only skin color, but every situation do we consider other people? Do we consider where they're coming from? You know, what's amazing about that statement is it. It reminds me of our Savior.

Jeremy Sweets  25:48
And John one verses one and two, it says In the beginning was the Word and the Word was with God and the Word was God. The same was in the beginning with God and without Him was not anything made that was made. In verse 14, it identifies the word in this way. It says in the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us. And we have seen his glory, glory as the only Son from the Father full of grace and truth. Do you see what Jesus did? He stepped inside our skin. And he walked around in it. When I look at Jesus Christ, I see empathy modeled, he considered our situation dittany And Hebrews two verses 17 and 18. It says, Therefore he had to be made like his brothers in every respect, so that he might become a merciful and faithful High Priests in the service of God to make propitiation for the sins of the people, for because he himself has suffered when tempted, He is able to help those who are being tempted. Do you see what Jesus can do and why he can do it? It says that he can help. Because he has been in our situation, he has walked in our moccasins, and Hebrews four and verse 15, it says, For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but One who in every respect has been tempted as we are yet without sin. You can almost use their the word empathize couldn't knowing that that's a modern word. But that's the concept there, we do not have one who has not been where we are. And then tempt tempted as we have been tempted. yet without sin. Jesus Christ is the greatest example of empathy the world has ever known. In Philippians, two verses five through rate Paul compels us to have this mind among yourselves which is yours in Christ Jesus, develop his mind, though he was in the form of God did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied himself by taking the form of a servant. Being born in the likeness of men and being found in human form, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross. Jesus lowered himself willingly and suffered great pain. I made the point before I'll probably make it again that if Jesus Christ were to come down as a great king, a general of a great army that ruled over the entire world, that would have been a step down. But that's not what he did is he came down as a servant, the lowest among men. Let us develop that mindset. Jesus displayed empathy, compassion and kindness when he reached out to sinners, that was rejected from society, he spent time with those that were in need. When the world said, Don't be near that person, that person's a sinner. Jesus spent time with when the world said stay away, don't touch that person. They're unclean. Jesus extended his hand of love and kindness, and he often touched those that were considered unclean and brought them healing. He shoved showed love and concern for all those he saw, for all those he saw. So let us have this mind, which is yours in Christ Jesus. Let me summarize by looking at a few points. I don't know if this is a summary, but just some reminders for rules. So what can we do to practice empathy? Well, first of all, we need to recognize the value of each person. It's very easy to recognize the value of our friends. They're important to us or maybe our family. They're important to us or maybe someone that's popular in school, someone that's popular out in the world, the star athletes, the great musician, we see their value, don't we? But we often overlook those In the background, we often overlook those that the world society has deemed deemed unimportant.

Jeremy Sweets  30:12
But the Gospel says recognize the value of each and every person. And if we're to step inside someone else's shoes, we have to start with a place where they are valuable. And they are valuable because they are made in the image of God. They are valuable because God loves them and cares for them. They are valuable because God sent His only Son, to die on the cross for them recognize the value of each person. Not only that, but get to know other people. You can't really step inside someone's situation if you don't know them at all, do you. So spend time getting to know others. Be observant and aware and see what you can do to talk to other people find out about their situation. Reach out, reach out to those who are by themselves. Reach out to those that are alone. Consider how you would feel if you were in that situation if you're hurting in need. And so be active and reaching out, don't sit back and say, well, if they need help, they're going to ask for it. Some people will maybe there's a large segment of people that will suffer in silence. And they would love for someone to reach out to them, but they're not going to take the step to do that. And so let us be a people that are again aware, looking out reaching out. And let us reach out. Give I was going to label this give but given here, give a hand. Give your time. You know, it's one thing to say that you recognize another person's value because they're made in the image of God. But it's another thing to show them they are valuable by how you treat them. giving of your time giving an ear to them giving a hand that shows someone that they are valuable. show compassion, grace and forgiveness, particularly in the face of sin. Notice I didn't say overlook or ignore sin, but respond with gentleness and care. And a sense we're pulling people to what is right, bringing them along rather than pushing people away with judgment and condemnation. Disregard and arrogance. Let us respond to others with compassion, grace, and forgiveness. fasion four and verse 32, symbolizes this or represents this and we see this many other places in Scripture Be kind to one another, tender hearted, forgiving one another as God and Christ forgave you. As we show kindness, grace and forgiveness let us know that we have received that from God. We are as it says, In the Old Testament, we were strangers and sojourners in the land of Egypt. In the land of sin, we were separated from God. And so let us remember that situation and reach out to others. The poem that we started with says, Be slow to judge, be slow to judge and that should be our stance as well give people the benefit of the doubt think the best of them. Don't run with what is negative. We all the world seems to love sensationalized stories and things that happen we want to hear about that and and sometimes that involves big downfalls and all eyes are on let us not be a people that is quick to judge quick to think what is poor of others, but let us think the best and let us also be thankful for our Savior's empathy because he is one that stepped inside our skin and walked around and lived as a humble, humble servant. If you'll allow me I'd like to close the sermon by reading the entirety of the poem that we started with. It's called judge softly by Mary Lathrop written in 1895.

Jeremy Sweets  34:21
Pray don't find fault with the man that limps or stumbles along the road. Unless you have worn the moccasins he wears or stumbled beneath the same load, there may be tears in his souls that hurt, though hidden away from view. The burden he bears placed on your back may cause you to stumble and fall to don't sneer at the man who is down today unless you have felt the same blow that caused his fall or felt the shame that only the Fallen know. You may be strong but still the blows that were his unknown to you in the same way may cause you to stagger and fall to don't be harsh with A man that sins are pelted with words or stone or disdain, unless you are sure you have no sense of your own. And it's only wisdom and love that your heart contains. For you know, if the tempters voice should whisper as soft to you, as it did to him when he went astray, it might cause you to falter to just walk a mile in his moccasins before you abuse, criticize and accuse. If just for one hour, you could find a way to see through his eyes instead of your own news. I believe you'd be surprised to see that you've been blind and narrow minded, even unkind. There are people on reservations and in the ghettos, who have so little hope, and too much worry on their minds, rather there. But for the grace of God go you and I, just for a moment slip into his mind and traditions and see the world through His Spirit and eyes before you cast a stone or falsely judge his conditions. Remember to walk a mile in his moccasins and remember the lessons of humanity taught to you by your elders, we will be known forever by the tracks we leave and other people's lives. Our kindness and generosity take the time to walk a mile in his moccasins. It may be that you're here this morning and you've not obeyed the gospel. Jesus Christ came to this earth and lived as a man faced the temptation of sin and overcame that died on a cross for you. So that you might have a hope of heaven. You can believe that Jesus is the Christ, repent of your sins, confess that Jesus is the Christ and be baptized in the water for the forgiveness of your sins. That step is not a quick one time thing, but it's a lifelong commitment, where you're buried with him in the waters of baptism, and you're raised to walk in newness of life, having your sins washed away, but also having a new commitment and direction in life. It may be that you're here this morning and you are a Christian, but you've not honored your commitment. Whatever your situation you need to make your life right today. You're not guaranteed tomorrow or even the next hour. Make your life right today. There's any subject to the invitation. Please come as we stand and sing at this time.
