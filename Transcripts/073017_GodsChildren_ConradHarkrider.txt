This morning, we're going to be studying from the book of Philippians Philippians chapter two, if you want to be turning your Bibles to that passage

Conrad Harkrider  00:26
my wife and I were talking to another family, not anyone that's attends here. But we were discussing one of the great challenges in parenting small kids. And that is keeping track of your children, when you're in a public place, is really difficult. And sometimes really, the only thing you can do is to physically restrain them, strap them into the car seat, or the stroller, the shopping cart, whatever it is, so that they can't move, they can't go anywhere, which is exactly what we do in the baby class back here, we have those chairs that are designed to keep them in place, maybe we should get those for all the classes. And I don't know how well that would go over in the middle school, high school class. But sometimes that's all you can do to keep them in the same spot. So we're talking to this family about situations when you're in a public place, like a park or a museum or somewhere where the kids are free to roam around. And they were they made a suggestion or they had read something that dressing your kids in the same outfit, where they're all wearing green plaid shirts, so they have on those bright blue clothes can help you to be able to spot them in a crowd or identify them. Even if they're on the other side of the park. You could look out and say there's one of mine. What are they doing over there and then try to corral them back over to the playground? When we look out at the world today, what do God's children look like?

Conrad Harkrider  02:13
How can we identify them? Where we would look out and say there's one of his children? What is it that makes them different that characterizes the people of God? In Philippians, chapter two and verse 15, Paul urges his readers to become children of God, in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation. This morning, I want to talk to you about God's children living in this generation. What are God's people supposed to look like? What type of behavior and conduct and attitudes should they exhibit living in the world today? Read with me from Philippians chapter two, beginning in verse 12. It says, Therefore, my beloved as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only. But now much more in my absence, work out your own salvation, with fear and trembling. For it is God who works in you both to will and to do for His good pleasure. Do all things without complaining and disputing that you may become blameless and harmless children of God without fault in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, among whom you shine as lights in the world, holding fast the word of life, so that I may rejoice in the day of Christ that I have not run in vain or labored in vain? Yes, and if I am being poured out as a drink offering on the sacrifice and service of your faith, I am glad and rejoice with you all. For the same reason you also be glad and rejoice with me. In the book of Philippians, Paul's writing to a group of people that he was very familiar with. If you remember Paul and Silas went to Philippi. And there they were able to convert several people. They met with a woman named Lydia, who was a seller of purple. And she and her family believed. Paul was able to teach the jailer who was watching over him in the prison and he and his whole household were baptized. And so it is when Paul writes to them in verse 12, he addresses them as beloved. The NIV says, My dear friends, this is a group that Paul cared about, in a very special way. The first thing to note, we think about the chilled about God's children and this generation is comes from verse 12. Notice that verse Again, it says, Therefore my beloved as you have always obeyed, not as in my presence only, but now much more in my absence work out your own salvation with fear and trembling. as God's children we are to have a willing obedience. This was not an obedience. What Paul encouraged us to the Philippians. This was not something that was done out of reluctance or obligation, but they were willing. Notice some of the words that he uses here, he says that they always obeyed. This is not saying that these people were flawless or perfect, or they never made any mistakes. But rather, this was a constant, ongoing practice in their life. Their obedience wasn't just a random occurrence, kind of a one time thing that just happened. This was their way of life, something that they were doing continuously. A willing obedience means doing the right thing, regardless of the circumstances. Did you notice that Paul encourages them to obey not only when he is present with them, when he is with them, but also when he is absent when he is away from these brethren. He encourages them to do these things in all circumstances, I can remember being in elementary school, and they really enforced or emphasize the need to walk quietly from place to place when you were in the halls. And so we would be in a straight line, and we'd be going down the hallway and have our finger close to our mouth, and everyone would be walking in silence. But there would be those points where the line would start to turn around the corner, and the teacher would go out of view. And it was amazing. All of a sudden, people started talking. And then when the line straightened back up, and the teacher was now in view, it went silent again, that is conditional obedience, obedience that is based upon the situation who's watching who can see me, is there a possibility that I might get in trouble or that something might happen to me. And that's not just an issue for school aged children. For all of us, when we change our behavior, based upon the people that were around? Have you ever done that when you're with your family, you act a certain way. And then when you're with people from school, you act another way or when you're at work, or when you're with some of your friends, and your conduct and our attitudes can start to shape and morph and change based upon the circumstances of who we're with. What about when I'm by myself? Do my thoughts and my actions Are they consistent? Even in those settings?

Conrad Harkrider  07:59
Paul tells them, that their conduct their obedience, obedience should not change or be different. Based upon the circumstances, it is something that is to be consistent. A willing obedience also involves work. Did you notice that word, he tells them to work out their own salvation. Notice that word, it implies effort to work at something we invest time and energy, and effort in the things that we truly care about. If I have a truck or a car that I'm that I really like, then you might find me on Saturday morning out in the driveway, spraying it down, putting the soap on it, washing it by hand, putting the wax buffing it out, spending my time and my efforts to take care of it. If I care about my yard, then I'm out there, pulling the weeds, mowing the grass regularly planting some of the flowers or paying someone else to do those things. Because that's something that I am invested in that I care about. If you have a dog or a pet that you care about, then you are taking them on walks, you're spending money on them, you're making sure that they have enough food and toys and whatever it is to keep them happy. But we put emphasis on the things that we value. And the question is, are we giving proper attention to our salvation? Are we working? Are we spending effort on our spiritual bodies, our relationship with the Lord? We may work on the car, and we work on the crafts, and we work on the house and we put emphasis on relationships and people that we care about. But what about our salvation? Is there energy and attention that's been expended on that area of our life? You Paul is writing to a group of people that are already Christians, they have already believed and yet he encourages them to continue on. Look at chapter one and verse 17, of Philippians, or chapter one and verse 27, Philippians 127, only let your conduct be worthy of the gospel of Christ, so that whether I come and see you or am absent, I may hear of your affairs, that you stand fast in one spirit, with one mind striving together for the faith of the gospel. Our conduct should be described as something that is worthy of the gospel, and that requires great work. Also notice the attitude or approach. He says that this has to be done with fear and trembling, fear and trembling. We obey God with a sense of fear that is that we respect him. When you think about trembling, someone who is doing something very carefully, with much thought, they are sensitive, not not someone who is arrogant or stubborn or just set in their ways, but we are receptive to the Lord. In this generation, the children of God are people who display this attitude of a willing obedience. Also, notice verse 13. In verse 13, he says, For it is God who works in you both to will and to do for His good pleasure. The next quality we see is that God is working in us. We can know that children of God in today's world because God is working through he is working in those individuals. We are to have a willing obedience in verse 12, were to work out our own salvation. But if you were just to stop there, at the end of verse 12, you might get the impression that it's all on us, that it's riding on our shoulders, it's all up to us in order to work this out. And in order to make this happen. But don't miss the incredible truth that is presented here in verse 13. God is at work in us. Consider the analogy of a sailboat, you have a sailboat, when the sails are lowered, and they're wrapped up, then the boat doesn't move forward, the wind could be blowing at 30 miles an hour. But if those sails aren't raised up, the boat is not going to go anywhere, maybe it's getting pushed by the waves of the current but it's not moving in a forward direction. In the same way, if you have the sails fully extended to their highest point, and everything is wide open, but there's no wind, you get the same result. It's not going to be moving,

Conrad Harkrider  12:55
the boat is just going to standstill. It requires both of these conditions to be present, in order for there to be progress. Our obedience and working out our own salvation is like raising the sale. It's like opening our hearts to God, we're responding to him. But that's ultimately not, not what propels us forward in this life. Because God is, in a sense, he's like the wind, he is the energy, he is the force that moves us forward. Both are essential. And so if we focus too much on our obedience, then that's like raising the sails but having no wind. If we say that God does everything, and we have no responsibility, then that's like sitting in a boat that's got the sails down when the wind is gushing. Both aspects are important. And so keep that in your mind. God is working through us. He's the power in the sale that drives us forward. And we think about practical issues like how are we going to overcome temptation? How are we going to exhibit self control? How are we going to get past thoughts of pride or jealousy or lust if we're relying on the strength that comes from ourselves, then we're setting ourselves up for failure. Ultimately, we cannot move past these things until we surrender ourselves to God and realize that he is the one that can renew our hearts and provide that inner strength to help us to give us a new set of desires. In Ezekiel chapter 36, in verse 25, it says, I will sprinkle clean water on you, and you shall be cleaned from all your uncleanness and from all your idols I will cleanse you and I will give you a new heart and a new spirit and I will put with it and I will put within you and I will remove the heart of stone from your flesh and give you a heart of flesh. And I will put my Spirit within you and cause you to walk in My statutes. And be careful to obey my rules. What the Prophet is saying here, look at all of the things that God is going to do, he's going to cleanse you, he's going to give you a new heart, put that new spirit in you remove the heart of stone and give you that heart of flesh, He puts His Spirit inside of us, and that causes us or gives us the desire to walk in his ways to serve Him, to keep his statutes. And so we think about our dependency upon God, turning to him looking to Him, to renew us, and give us strength. And when you start to think to yourself, that it's just too hard, that I don't have the strength or the power or the ability to overcome whatever challenge I'm facing. Remember that the one who created the universe, the one who has all power and authority is the same one that is working within you. In chapter one and verse six Philippians, one and verse six, Paul writes, this Being confident of this very thing, that he who has begun, a good work in you will complete it until the day of Jesus Christ, God started the work within us, and he is going to complete the project, he's going to finish it out, and keep us until the day of Christ. When you think about the men that Jesus selected to be His disciples, He didn't go and choose people who were flawless individuals that had no past or history that didn't come with any type of issues. No, instead, he he chose the impetuous fisherman. He chose the tax collector, and the Zealot, not to mention the apostle Paul, one who is committing himself to the persecution of Christians. And yet God took each one of these individuals, and he changed them. He shaped their hearts, he changed their desires, so that they can be useful instruments in his kingdom. And the same is true for us today. This is according verse 13. For God's good pleasure. He's doing these things because he wants to see his purposes fulfilled in our lives. God is working in each one of us. Also, notice verse 14.

Conrad Harkrider  17:47
It says, do all things without complaining and disputing that you may become blameless and harmless children of God without fall in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, among whom you shine as lights in this world, in order to shine as a light in this world, in order to stand out among this generation, did you catch what he said, God's people will be doing? God's people will be the ones who are living without complaining, verse 14. The NET Bible translates this as grumbling, or arguing. When you think about people who are complaining and grumbling in the scriptures, who is it that comes to mind, God had gone to great lengths to bring the children of Israel out of Egyptian bondage. He had performed incredible signs by the hands of Moses, to allow Pharaoh to release them. He had brought about a great victory and deliverance when the Red Sea swallowed up the army of Pharaoh, he was guiding them in a pillar of cloud by day and, and by fire by knights and providing for their needs along the way. And yet in Exodus, chapter 16, in verse one, this is what it says. And they set out from Elam and all the congregation of the people of Israel came to the Wilderness of Sin, which is between Elam and Sinai on the 15th day of the second month, after they had departed from the land of Egypt. And the whole congregation of the people of Israel grumbled against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness and the people of Israel said to them, would that we would have died by the hand of the Lord in the land of Egypt when we sat by the meat pots and ate bread to the fall, for you have brought us out into this wilderness to kill this whole assembly with hunger. It says that in the 15th day of the second month, the children of Israel observed the Passover on the 14th day of the first month. And what that means is that it has been just over A month since they saw the power of God delivering them out of Egyptian slavery, and yet, what do we find them doing here, they are longing to go back to the place where they had plenty of meat and bread to eat. They're grumbling against Moses, and Aaron, and doesn't the same thing happen with us today. We are so incredibly blessed. More than any other culture or time period in human history, we have so much. And yet, it is so easy for us to forget about the physical blessings, to disregard the spiritual blessings. And like a selfish child. We complain and grumble about our situation. A couple of nights ago, there was a issue with a substation transformer, whatever that is, here in Nashville. And the reason I know about it is because several 1000 People lost power, including everyone on my street. Now, this is not the time of year to be going without power slash AC. And you only want to be in that situation for so long. Not to mention what what is there really to do in the evenings when the TV doesn't work? The internet doesn't work. You can't turn any lights on. We were basically saying let's just go to sleep at 730 there was really nothing else to do. You start to think about it. That's pretty frustrating. But how often do I thank God for electricity? When I think about the blessings that God has given to me, is that something that is on the list. And the point is, there is so much around us so much wealth,

Conrad Harkrider  22:00
that we can find just about anything to complain about to say that this is not working correctly, or this is not the way I would want it to be. But in reality, God has truly blessed us above and beyond measure. Did you notice the scope of this and Philippians chapter two and verse 14, Paul says do all things without grumbling or complaining. That means that when I'm mowing the yard, or when I'm sitting in traffic, or when I'm waiting in line, or when I'm picking up after the kids, or when I'm doing those jobs or those tasks that don't seem very glamorous, or wonderful to me. Christians shine their light in everyday life with the type of attitude and perspective that we have, to the everyday events that we face. And if we're doing those things with complaining and arguing and disputing and discontentment and what type of impact does that have to those around us? Complaining is like a cancer it It robs us it steals the joy and the fulfillment that we could have. If there was anyone that had a right to be complaining it was the apostle Paul, he's writing this letter from a Roman prison and yet throughout his his words to the Philippians he's constantly telling them to rejoice, to be filled with joy, and to be grateful for what they had. Looking at the contrast between God's children and the world in verse 15, Paul says that God's children are to be blameless and harmless. You compare that with the world, the world is crooked and perverse. We are to be shining as lights in the world. And as the world becomes more embittered, and it grows darker and darker and moves further away from the Lord, then that is just an opportunity for God's people to shine even brighter. The standard doesn't come out, come down just because of the way that people around us are living their lives, the way that they see the world the things that they are talking about. We are to continue to do all things without complaining and disputing. Also notice verse 16. In verse 16, he says, holding fast the word of life so that I may rejoice in the day of Christ that I have not run in vain or labored in vain. What sets God's children apart in today's world, is that we are word centered. He says that they are to hold fast hold firmly to the word of life. If you remember the Jews who were in Berea when Paul and Silas took the word into that city, what Did it say about their response to God's Word in Acts chapter 17. In verse 11, it says, Now these Jews were more noble than those in Thessalonica. They receive the word with all eagerness, examining the scriptures daily to see if these things are so. eagerness desire readiness, they were hungering for the word. This was something that they were looking at that they were poring over on a daily basis. And the question is, Can the same be said of us? Do we have a longing, a craving for God's word? Do we desire it is our mind and our heart centered around it? We think to ourselves, I can't wait to get off work. So I can go home and watch that new show. Start watching the ballgame play with that new gadget that I've just got? Can you imagine if he told people at work that I need to leave a little early today because I need to spend some time in God's word. I need some quiet time with the word of life. It sounds a little strange, but that's what we see in the Bereans. They couldn't get enough they were searching daily. They were hungry for the Word of God. And what if we did the same thing? What if we hungered for God's word the same way that we do for entertainment, or for our next vacation or for recreation or for companionship?

Conrad Harkrider  26:37
And the question is, why shouldn't we? These are the words of life. That's what he says, Hold fast to the words of life. It's not just a book of good stories and moral principles and illustrations. This word is hope. This word is light, this word is true. This word has meaning and purpose. In a world that is so often filled with darkness, and lies and deceit. God's Word is true. And so my encouragement to you and to myself is to read it daily. Listen to it in the car, put it in to your mind. Listen to it and read it when you're feeling sad. And when your life is not going the way it's supposed to listen to it and read it when your life is going great. And God is blessing you with success. Get the word of God in your mind and become a word centered Christian. And did you notice what He said in verse 16. He says that I may rejoice in the day of Christ that I have not run or labored in vain. What would bring Paul joy is that these brethren would be holding firm to the word of life. Think about that, as parents. When we look back at our children after they are grown, and they have become adults in their race. If they are continuing to hold to the word of life, then we can say to ourselves, we did not run we did not labor in vain. They are still continuing to seek the Lord. And finally, God's children today are those who act with joy in suffering. Look at verse 17. It says yes, and if I am being poured out as a drink offering on the sacrifice and service of your faith, I am glad and rejoice with you all. For the same reason you also be glad and rejoice with me. In verse 16, Paul talks about rejoicing in the day of Christ. Verse 17, rejoice with you all verse 18. Rejoice with me. Paul talks about being the drink offering on their behalf in numbers 28 and 29. It talks about the sacrifices that were made, they had the grain offering and the meat offering and the drink offering which was poured on top of the sacrifice almost to complete the meal. And Paul says that's what he is to them. They are the the main sacrifice but he is being poured on top to complement their offering. And what we see in Paul here he is a person who is suffering. He is in prison, he is being mistreated, and yet we see him expressing Joy. Joy doesn't mean that you never feel sad. Joy doesn't mean that you never grieve or have pain in Philippians chapter two and verse 27. Paul talks about how he felt sorrow upon sorrow, in reference to a Pafford itis. He was still human and susceptible to discouragement and disappointment. And there were many times that he found himself in despair. But notice the difference he was able to pivot his perspective to change his frame of reference To see how God was going to use these things for His glory, and he didn't allow them to consume him. In Philippians chapter four in verse six, it says, Do not be anxious about anything but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God. And the peace of God which surpasses all understanding will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus. Christians are to be with joy and suffering. And we can do that by taking our cares and our anxieties and our concerns to the Lord. Perhaps the most noticeable quality and God's children today, in the midst of great hurt and suffering and difficulty and pain, the Lord's people still offer praise, Thanksgiving, and express joy to the Lord. That will allow us to shine as lights in this world. We close this morning we're going to sing a song and invitation to try to encourage all who are here to have a closer walk with Christ to begin your life in service to God, if there's something that we can do to encourage you to help you in that path. Please come down to the front as we stand and sing
