It's always good to assemble with brethren here to worship God to honor him to glorify Him and all that we do. I guess as we get started, had lots of questions about my nose. And if I get into a fight or something, well, I got a, I had a fight off a bear when I was jogging the other day, and if you think this looks bad, you should see him still laid out cold, knock them out cold, but actually just possible skin cancer, knock off a little bit of tissue often, though, so should recover fully from that. But we're here to praise God to glorify Him to strive to become more and more like him with every passing day. The devil is out to get us and to bring us down in various ways. And our job is to fill our hearts and minds so fully with God's word that we can withstand the trials and temptations that the devil sets before us. Here at Broadmoor, we stress the importance of reading God's Word on a regular basis, we know the value and the power of the written word of God. And I'm sure that maybe many of you are on some type of reading schedule, I hope that you are, if you're not on a reading, schedule the Bible I urge you to get on one, whatever fashion that might be. I want to suggest that we glorify God and grow stronger in our faith when we feed ourselves daily on God's word. And reading God's word and studying the Bible, keep this in mind is in our best interest is not an exercise in futility. It's not some type of legalistic action that the elders have put into place, but it's in our best interest. And I want to suggest something this evening. It's even more beneficial to us than reading God's word. And that is writing out the word of God. And Conrad's lesson this morning, one of the points that he mentioned as a characteristic of God's children is that they are word centered, holding fast or holding fast to the word of life. And that's that should define who we are. We are consumed with God's word it defines our lives and gives us the hope that God wants us to have. This afternoon Drew Johnson issued a challenge for us abroad and released a man to memorize the book of Jude button in the month of August. That's a great challenge to think about. Found out this afternoon also that Jeremy sweets is using a scripture type are apt to help memorize scripture, those are all great tools doesn't matter which one we use, or if we use all of them. But the importance of knowing God's word, studying God's word, and then pressing that into our hearts and mind cannot be overstated. And so this evening, I want to talk with you about sorry, up there, I'm sorry, the value of writing out Scripture as a practice of building faith in in our lives. And this is something that we can do if we will set our minds to doing that. If you have your Bibles open, you might go ahead and turn to our Texas evening, which is in Deuteronomy chapter 17. Really, verses 18 through 20.

Mike Roy  03:07
Basically, and as God's looking to administer justice for his people, he understands that the nation of Israel is going to want to be liked the nations around about them. And one of the characteristics would be that they want to appoint a king over them. And God really that was not part of his plan. But it gave them some some guidelines and told the king not to humilate many horses or wives or silver. But then look at verse 18. Look at the charge that God gives the king of Israel, and I I'm not sure if I've noticed this before, maybe forgot it. Verse 18, said, Now shall come about that when he sits on the throne of his kingdom, he shall write for himself a copy of this law, on a scroll in the presence of the Levitical priest, it shall be with Him and He shall read it all the days of his life, that he may learn to fear the Lord his God, by carefully observing all the words of this law, and the statues, that his heart may not be lifted up above his countrymen, and that he may not turn aside from the commandment to the right or the left, so that he and his sons may continue long in his kingdom, in the midst of Israel. I want you to notice that that's gonna be our text. And I'm gonna have that on the screen here in just a moment as well. But look at this writing assignment that God gives the king of Israel you have to I want you to write out the law is that the entire pentateuch from Genesis to Deuteronomy, or is it just the book of Deuteronomy? I don't know. But that was a huge writing pass that's long before personal computers and, and and ballpoint pens and number two lead pencils, with a pen and ink like a quill and a jar of ink, who have to write out the word of God by himself. He couldn't have the scribes do that. What a compelling thing to think about. So this may say that this was a, like an Old Testament term paper for the King to write out, think about them hand writing, the old law, how long would that take him? Weeks? Months? I don't know, how long could it be a year, I don't know. It's a long time. And so this is a past that gives rise to this lesson is from an article I read online. And so from this context of the King being charge, to write out the word of God for Himself to have his own copy, we want to talk about the value of writing out scripture. So let's look at the text for just a moment as we go to the screen. So again, just very quickly read through this, again, it shall come about when he sits on the throne of his kingdom, he shall write for himself a copy of this law on a scroll. That's not like writing on loose leaf paper. So he had a right for himself, do this himself a copy of the law on a scroll in the presence of the Levitical priests. While Why do that in the presence of the Levitical priest, they're going to make sure that he gets it right, he had that he dots every i and crosses every T literally, I don't know all the terms in the Hebrew language there. So he does this in the presence of these priests. In verse 19, it shall be with him, and he shall read it all the days of his life. God doesn't want the king straying, he doesn't want the king leading the people back to Egypt. That would be a real temptation. And then he goes on to say that he may learn to fear the Lord his God. So that's kind of the purpose of writing out scripture. And He does that by carefully observing all the words of his law and the statutes. So as we go through this and make some applications for us this evening, let's notice, first of all, the priority and the urgency of Scripture and the hearts and minds of every Christian today, this lesson is for you. And for me. God says about that, when he makes a copy of the law, it shall be with him. Is God's word with you? Do you take that with you? I trust with our cell phones and laptops and that type of thing. We're fortunate to have access to that. But taking God's Word with us, I do that myself. I trust that many of us do that, throughout the day, take a chance to read God's word, a portion of Scripture may be trying to memorize a verse or two. But the the importance there we see is that God charges him to keep his word with him. And then he says he shall read it all the days of his lives. One thing to obey the gospel is young, Christian, and then kind of grow, weaken our faith and stray from God's word. But the challenge for us is to read God's word all the days of our lives, it's our lifeline to heaven, it's our manna from God. And so that's the charge that God gives the king to read it all the days of his life. And again, with I'm thankful that so many are doing different things, creative things, to read God's word, to study God's Word, to memorize God's word. This is where we get our hope of eternal life. So we see the urgency of Scripture. And again, you'll look at the context over here in chapter 19, what's the effect? What is the practical effect of reading God's word, or actually, in this context, writing God's word, it says, to keep his heart from filling with fries. So God wants to King of Israel, to keep his heart from filling with pride in the way that he does that he tells him to write out the word of God, keep it with you, and read it all the days of your life. Reading the Bible is not some mindless activity. It's something that is used to strengthen our faith. So to keep his heart from filling with pride, to prevent his heart from turning from God's commands that again, right from the text.

Mike Roy  09:17
He said, so that he and his sons may live and serve long in the kingdom. So that's the practical benefit of reading God's Word, the practical benefit of writing out scripture. A lot of us do that. I've been in the habit of doing that for a long time. And sometimes I write it, sometimes I type it. And I made me realize that actually, I've been doing some of this myself, not perfectly not not completely, but there's benefit of that write out the word of God. Listen to God's word, and it can have a tremendous impact in our lives. Why does so many Christians that we have known go astray and leave the Lord's church for different reasons, so often? God's word is not hidden deeply within their hearts, lots of different issues that can cause any one of us to stray to give up our faith and turn our turn our backs on God, begin the purpose of reading God's Word in writing out scripture for the king was, so he would keep pride out of his heart so he wouldn't stray from God's commands, and that he and his sons would serve long in the kingdom. So what you notice here in, in the text in Deuteronomy, chapter 17, the clear purpose of Scripture, the clear purpose of impressing scripture into our hearts and minds is that the King may learn to fear the Lord his God, that's, that's at the heart of our service to God. And, and I think of a passage that one of my favorite from the Old Testament in Proverbs chapter 14, verses 26. And 27 says in the fear of the Lord one has strong confidence, and his children will have a refuge. The fear of the Lord is a fountain of life, that one may turn away from the snares of death. So does anyone out here this evening? want stronger confidence, greater assurance? I certainly do. You want greater confidence, Fear God, when you fear God, there's no one else to fear. You don't fear, even failure or your own weaknesses? Do you want your children have a refuge a sense of a safe place? When we fear God, as parents, we provide a safe haven for our children. And the stronger we fear God, the safer our children will become? Again, look at this text, this a very vivid picture, would you like to see your life described as drinking from a life giving fountain. And certainly, that's a compelling image, again to Texas, that the fear of the Lord is a fountain of life. So that's, that's the practical benefit of serving God, fearing him produces this like, it's like drinking from a life giving stream. And so it again, it stresses to us the importance of that. And also, by fearing God, we turn away from the snares of death, I want you to notice again, from this, this text, some important lessons. When God commands the king to write out the whole, the Book of the Law, there's a progression that takes place here. First you spend time writing, then you spend time in that process reading. And then you begin following God's words. I think that's what God has in mind with the king. You write this out. And as the King writes it, he has to read it and think about it and contemplate his meaning. So that ultimately he will follow the written commands of God. So here's some some benefits and none, not an exhaustive list. But some benefits of hand copying scripture. It forces us to slow down and think about God's word. So often, I read God's word and honestly, if I go through my my reading schedule, read two or three chapters in Isaiah, I forget about it. But when you stop and write out God's word, it forces you to slow down and think about God's word. I think secondly, it helps us to dwell on what we're writing and reading. It causes us to, to focus what what writing out Scripture does, it's a focus activity. And I'm gonna focus on an attention deficit kind of guy, you probably are too, right? Get so many distractions, too many distractions. And by writing and copying God's word, it causes us and helps us to dwell on what we're writing and reading. I think it helps us to remember the word of God. I think that's one reason why God gives the king discharge.

Mike Roy  14:06
I think it also causes us and helps us to see details in scripture that we often overlook when we stop, slow down, write out the word of God. And I think ultimately, it helps us to come to know God more intimately. It's a valuable process. I think if I'm not mentioning we get a one of our former members visiting with us tonight. I think this young lady wrote out God's the entire Bible. That's a remarkable thing to think about writing out God's word. And so again, it is it's a it's a process by which it helps us to slow down and focus on God's word. It reminds me this passage in Psalm chapter 46, in verses eight through 11. The writer says, Come behold the works of the Lord how he is brought desolations on the earth he makes worse sees to the end of the The earth he breaks the bow and shatters the sphere, he burns the chariots with fire in the midst of all the upheaval of the kingdoms of the earth, the rise and fall of kings and queens and presidents, and all the anxiety that's in the hearts and minds of God's people. What does this almost tell us to do in verse 10, be still in and know that I am God. And that's what writing up God's Word does. It makes us stop and think about how awesome our God is. There's no king who can withstand his power. There's nobody who has enough money to compare with God's wealth. And so that's what the psalmist is telling us in spite of the upheaval of the world and the changes in politics, we certainly pray for our President and other world leaders. But in the end, we reverence our God in heaven, who was the king of kings, the Lord of lords. And, and we accept the advice, the instruction here, to be still to slow down to stop to relax is another translation might say there, but to be still, and know that I am God. And so what writing God's Word does for us, is it helps to transform our thinking, considered these observations from a writer, I found online. And this illustrates the transforming power and writing out scriptures. And this writer says, when God's word is flowing through my pan, and spilling out onto my paper, it is no longer just a passive discipline to read the word. Rather I am fully immersed in it. There's a difference between writing God's word and just reading it. And so often when I read it, not long after that, I forget what I've read, unfortunately. But it becomes a it's a it's an active activity. And the writer goes on to say this. God's word, listen, this God's Word came more alive to me in that discipline than anything else I had done before. You want to change in your life or changing your thinking, greater faith, greater purity, greater trust, faith or assurance, greater confidence. Take a pen. Take a computer if you want. Take a pen though. Write out the word of God. In fact, I was talking to Gary curd the other day, set up at the one stone bookstore up in Bowling Green that are run by Christians. They've got books out their notebooks that are blank, it'll say Book of Ephesians. You buy the blank notebook and you start writing the book of Ephesians. That can think in verse three blessed to be the God and Father of our Lord and Jesus Christ. So you can buy notebooks, Colossians, Ephesians, whatever, whatever book is blank inside. And you sit there and you write out the Bible, you write out that that small book, so it's again a compelling exercise that leads to a think greater faith and trust in our in our hearts and our minds. We all want greatest strength, want greater assurance, greater peace of mind, one of the greatest things that we can do. This is one of them is writing out God's word you couple that with the powerful worship that we engage in, and studying God's Word in the fellowship that we have, we put together a protective armor that even the devil cannot penetrate. Look at Think about also with me.

Mike Roy  18:29
The power these are just some my thoughts. When we write out the word of God, I think, number one, we come to know Him more fully. Isn't that the goal of preaching? Isn't that the goal of worship? Isn't that the goal of teaching God's word so that we can know Him? Love Him, serve Him trust him, but know his word? I talked to customers all the time. And my business and lady from a well known denominational church says, we don't know scripture. She talks about her church and probably denominational Christianity as we know it. She's right. People in general don't know the word of God. But certainly as Christians let that never been named device that we don't know God's Word we have to god man went through extreme measures to give us a his own word, we can have it in our hands, multiple copies, electronic copies. May it never be just sitting on a coffee table or up in a bookcase collecting dust, these other very words of God. So when we write out the word of God, we come to know Him more fully. I think we see his characteristics more clearly. The more we read scripture, when we write out Scripture, we see the characteristics of His love, His holiness, His purity, His justice, His mercy. So writing out scripture actually transforms our hearts and minds in that process. I think another benefit of of writing out the word of God is that we develop a deeper reverence for him and I start reading about the promise of eternal joy and sharing it in God's glory forever, is such a compelling image in my mind that I say to myself, I'm going to make sure to one thing, no matter what happens in life, how much money I make or don't make, I'm going to leave my wife and children for God's presence, I'm not going to miss that. That's why God made that. That's why That's why God describes heaven in such glowing details. He wants us to choose heaven over everything else on earth. And he gives graphic imagery of that. When you look at what he says about those who disobey his will, and being cast away into eternal Outer Darkness and eternal flame of fire, why does he say that? He doesn't want us to go there. And so when we write out God's Word, we end up developing a deeper reverence for him. I think also we become more eager to obey Him. That's exactly what the Moses saying, God is saying through Moses in the book of Deuteronomy, so that he might be careful to obey these statues, right, the word of God would, and that will lead to a greater degree of obedience, and ultimately, by writing out God's Word, which causes us to read it, and think about it, right and visualize it, and that's the power there. But when we do that, we become more like, God, we become more like Jesus Christ. That's our ultimate goal, right? Our ultimate goal is to inhabit eternity, and being made into his gods very image. But it's interesting. It's not just the ultimate goal. It's the the more immediate goal. My goal now is to become more like Jesus Christ, and I've got, I've got a long way to go. And most of us probably would say the same thing. But that is the goal to become more like Him. God made us in such a way he gave us the gospel so that through obedience to Jesus Christ, we can believe in Him, repent of our sins, confess our faith in Him and be baptized. That wasn't just something that God came up with, because that was seemed like a good idea, idea to him, but as part of the transformation process, are thinking about second Corinthians chapter three, verse 18, Paul talks about the idea of beholding the glory of the Lord and verse 18. And he said, We all with unveiled face beholding the glory of the Lord, as we look at Scripture are being transformed into the same image, from one degree of glory to another. For this comes from the Lord who has the spirit, the goal of worship, the goal of Bible study, the goal of Bible teaching, the goal of writing out scripture, is so that you and I can become more and more like Jesus Christ, but it involves an effort we have to be willing to put forth that effort. James chapter one, verse 21, mentions this. James chapter one, verse 21, James says, Therefore put away all filthiness and rampant wickedness, and receive with meekness, the implanted word. Where does God want us to place his word?

Mike Roy  23:18
He wants us to implant it to impress it into our hearts. He wants His word to be embedded, embedded in our hearts, does that describe your life in my life? Against the office, I read my Bible today I went to church, we kind of do the checklist and but we're talking about getting God's word deeply embedded into your heart. When that happens, then the trials and the temptations of life do not overwhelm us. We know about temptation, we know about fear. We know about anxiety, we know about all types of temptation. But when God's word is embedded in your heart, Satan looks for somebody else to bring down. So James says that we are to receive with meekness, the implanted word, how powerful is God's word. Look at this text, how powerful is it? It's able to save your soul from hell. That is powerful. God's word is so powerful. It can save us he can save our soul to be with Him for all eternity. And so but there's a process, it's a choice there that we choose to implant God's word. One way that we can implant God's Word into our hearts and mind is by writing it out. Lots of different ways. So this evening, and one other thing I want to mention mentioned from the text verse 22, says, but be doers of the word, and not hearers only deceiving yourselves. So the reality is if we hear God's word, and we don't do it, we're fools. we deceive ourselves, that's not good. So when we hear God's word, we have to act on it. And that's what he says over here. So as we wrap up the lesson this evening and extend an invitation, the question is, Will you accept the challenge to write out the word of God in your life again, there's, you can go go online, I've seen some of these online, go to the bookstore up in Bowling Green, you can get empty journals, notebooks. So write it on an index card, take a scripture, a scripture, write it out, until it becomes a part of you write it in a notebook, write it in a journal any which way. But the whole idea is that the more we engage in this process of writing God's word, it makes us read it and think about it, do this, here's another thing. Put it at the entrance of your house. Some of y'all might have already been that put that on the walls of your house. So the point is, there's a challenge for us when you think about what God made the king of Israel do when he became king, and it wasn't part of God's original plan. But he says to safeguard that King to keep them pure and faithful to God. He charged him to write out the law. So some great thoughts for us to think about is well to hear this evening. You're not a Christian, you don't have the HOPE of eternal life. You, you can have the hope of everlasting life and all the blessings that come with that, when you obey the gospel and to do so that involves faith in Christ, willingness to repent of your sins, confess your faith in him and then be baptized in water to have your sins forgiven, that makes you a child of God, then you want to drink in God's Word on a regular basis. Or it may be that there's some here deceiving who need the prayers of this congregation. We all face struggles. I say that with some frequency. We all face difficulties, trials, that we all we all deal with it but maybe that you just want us to pray with you for if there's some need that you have this evening. We invite you to come while we stand and sing the imitation song.
