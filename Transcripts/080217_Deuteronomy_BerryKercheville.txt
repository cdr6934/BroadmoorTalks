Unknown Speaker  00:00
Well, how are you? Hope you're doing? Well, it's good to see you tonight, always a pleasure to be able to come over and speak with you visit with some old friends, and some young friends. So I'm the old friend there, the young friend. So there we are good, too good to be with you, you are going to have to listen tonight the old fashioned way, because I'm going to have to preach the old fashioned way. In other words, there won't be any pictures on the screen to entertain you, though. I'm a Mac user. And I have no idea what that other computer company is. And I don't know why anybody invented it. So I'm not hooked up that way, at any rate, so we're going to do it the old fashioned way, and you will need your Bible. And we're going to take a look at how Deuteronomy fits in to the story of us how Deuteronomy fits into our story, the story of the old and new covenants, and how those match together and how Deuteronomy has its place. In the Old Testament, Canon. Deuteronomy is a book that we often maybe kind of skim over, we have said, well, the word Deuteronomy means second law giving, and it does. But that's not what it was originally called. And therefore, second law giving well we scratch our heads and say, well, I already read the first law giving an exodus and Leviticus. And so I don't need to read the second law giving well maybe there's a few additional things I can know to Deuteronomy. But other than that, that was just for those guys and gals who were entering the land of Canaan, and after everybody died in the wilderness, and maybe we don't give it the attention that it needs to be given. So I would like to show you how it fits within the covenants of the Old and New Testaments, and then also how that is going to apply and fit with us in the importance of this great book. So Deuteronomy obviously is different than Exodus and Leviticus and Numbers simply because it is given just before the Israelites enter into the land of Canaan, it's given unto an entirely different people. Those who were the men of war 603,548 out of 603,550 are dead. And I'm sure not a few older people who, who, who went to went to see their maker during that 40 years in the wilderness as well. So Moses, of course, is talking to the people who are going to enter the land and he's looking forward. Instead of looking in the present. He's saying, Okay, here's where things are going to go, here's what you need to be prepared for, here's what I got expects of you. So you don't end up like those people in the wilderness. So this is kind of the basic thrust. Now, when you get to the end of Deuteronomy around chapter 27, you're going to see the Lord talking about the, the coming of when they enter the land, and they're going to come to two mountains, Mount evil and mountain tourism. And as they're on Mount evil, and mount grism, Levites are going to go up and they're gonna call out blessings and curses concerning the nation of Israel. And I've always thought it was interesting that they're in chapter 27, you would notice that, as he does that, he's he says, well, now here's, here's what you're going to do. And he any beginning in verse 15, he starts this litany of curse be the man who, and then everybody's supposed to say amen. And you can just imagine you get a rhythm going. Curse me, the man who and I'll tell you what, when you read these, you are ready to say amen. Because there's some disgusting sins there. And you can just imagine people going a man Oh, yeah, a man and they're just just pounded it out a man after every time. And then all of a sudden, he gets to verse 26. And he says, Cursed is anyone who does not confirm the words of this law by doing them and all the people say amen.

Unknown Speaker  04:14
You just cursed yourself. You're cursed if you don't do all things written in that book. Remember, Paul quotes that doesn't mean over the book of Galatians, to show that you cannot be saved by law. Imagine being under a law and the very beginning God just says, you're cursed. Too bad for you. And you just said amen to wow. And this is delivered them toward the end of Moses speech as they're ready to go into the land of Canaan. Bummer. And then you go and read chapter 28. And he has about 14 verses in which he talks about bliss, and are you if you obey, and then beginning in verse 15, and all the way to the end of chapter 28 on verse 29, you have nothing but curses that are going to come on the people if they do not obey God, ie to the taking them into captivity and all of that. And there's this anticipation that goes on as to is this is this where this is going. And then you, you go through chapter 29, similar kinds of things. And you get to chapter 30, in verse one. And Moses says something very interesting 30 verse one, notice, and when all these things come upon you the blessing and the curse, which I have set before you, and you call them to mind, among all the nations where the Lord your God has driven you. Well, I took away the suspense that we had seen in chapter 27, and 28, and 29, here is a warning to you, if you do not obey the Lord curses are going to come upon you, you're going to be taken into captivity, you're gonna be taken off the land, your nation will be no more. And you get to chapter 30, verse one, and God says, By the way, when you call this all to mind, after I've driven you into the other nations, it's going to happen. Well, that's not very encouraging either is it? As like, Deuteronomy is getting more and more of a bummer. It's just downward spiral. And then you go, and I invite you to take a look at chapter 31. And you go over to chapter 31 of Deuteronomy. And let's notice our reading in verse 15. And the Lord appeared in the tent in a pillar of cloud and the pillar of clouds sit over the entrance of the tent. And the Lord said to Moses, behold, you are about to lie down with your father's this, then this people will rise and horror after the foreign gods among them in the land that they are entering. And they will forsake me and break my covenant that I have made with them, then my anger will be kindled against them in that day, and I will forsake them and hide my face from them.

Unknown Speaker  07:06
And they will be devoured, and many evils and troubles will come upon them so that they will say in that day, have not these evils come up on us, because our God is not among us. And I will surely hide my face in that day, because of all the evil that they have done. Because they have turned to other gods now therefore, write this song, and teach it to the people of Israel put it in their mouths, that this song may be a witness for me, against the people of Israel, for when I have brought them into the land flowing with milk and honey, which I swore to give to their fathers, and they have eaten in our full and grown fat, they will turn to other gods and serve them and despise me and break my covenant. And when you get to chapter 32, there's this very lengthy song, that God had Moses, teach the people so that they would learn it, memorize it, and for years, they would sing this song, as a testimony to them, of what God had warned them about us concerning the blessings and the curses. And when you read the song, the song basically says, We will fail. How about that, as Shane Scott says, there's your national anthem, we will fail. And that was the national anthem that God wanted Israel to learn as they went in, to the land of Canaan. Now, here's the interesting thing about that, that sets up the rest of the book, books of the Old Testament, Deuteronomy is a launching point. And this is the only part that should be on the screen. But Deuteronomy is a launching point, to show how this fulfillment takes place of what God has just said that they're going to turn away from Him, they're going to go after other gods, et cetera. So if you were reading a Hebrew Bible, you would have a different order. Most of you know that. But you would have a different order than what we would have in our Bibles. So following Deuteronomy, you would have Joshua, Judges, not Ruth. Okay. Joshua, Judges, Samuel, and kings, not Chronicles. Okay. Joshua, Judges, Samuel kings, or Samuel and Kings. Originally, were just one book each, we've divided them up. All right, so you would have those books. Now what those books do is they justify God. They justify the promises God made here, that there would be curses on the people when they did not obey them. So you and I know that as we look at Joshua, do you see everybody obeying the Lord? Well, that's probably the best generation, but they even don't drive Anybody out of the land and judges begins with that. And then it's a downward spiral. And who could have a more yucky book than judges as proving the wickedness of the people. And then you come to Samuel, and you have this horrible king Saul. And then you and then, of course, the last half of Samuel, our second Samuel, you have the story of King David, and he is the great hope.

Unknown Speaker  10:25
And how's he do? Well, the first 10 chapters, you just go, Well, David is finally the man, we need it. He's the king. He is a man after God's heart. He's everything that we had hoped for. And you get to chapter 11. And you have the Bathsheba incident. And in fact, chapters 11 and 12 of Second Samuel, just pivot around those two verses, those two chapters 11 and 12. And David after chapter 12, is a shell of the man he was before his family's a mess. In fact, most of his sons end up following the same pattern as their father where you have adultery, and you have murder. And it's just pitiful. And David, by the end of the book, the last chapter just tells us another of David, since it is a complete disaster. And it finishes out the picture that God had said in Deuteronomy, and then of course, you've transitioned into the kings, and then just gets worse. And by the time you get to the end of second Kings, where is it? Where are all the people? Well, they're, they're in captivity, and the nation is no more. So there is a picture of what Deuteronomy said, what happened, what Moses predicted, and God predicted would happen. So you have those particular books that fit into that. All right, and then you would have the prophets and the prophets, especially the ones that were aware of, that we are more aware of, and far in our on our Bible, those prophets are commentary on what happened in Judges through kings, though they're just a commentary on that, as they preach to the people and warn the people of the things that they've done and pronounced condemnation, based upon what the law was in Deuteronomy, and what the promise was in Deuteronomy 28, of the curses that would come upon them. One of the things you notice, as you read Isaiah, and Ezekiel, Jeremiah, there's constant references to what God had promised in Deuteronomy. So there's a very, very close connection. And then you get to the writings, and in the Hebrew Bible, and there are there are certain books that give you a hope for the future of Israel. Ruth, is one of those books. Ruth is not a cute little story, cute with love story. It is a picture of hope for Israel. It's a picture of a redeemer. And then you also have a picture in, in Daniel, of a hope for Israel. And then finally have a picture in Chronicles. Now Chronicles is the last book of the Hebrew Old Testament. And that is significant from the Hebrew point of view and from the message of the Old Testament, because Chronicles is written to the people who have come back out of Babylonian captivity. That should tell you right off the mistakes that we have often made when we've studied Old Testament history. I mean, if you're anything like me, and what I have, you know, been through and studies, you get to kings, and you study kings, and as you're studying kings, you kind of switch over to Chronicles now and then just to see what Chronicles added that we didn't hear in Kings. And then when we're done with kings, we kind of figure we studied Chronicles, and they're written to two different peoples, and for two different purposes. And that's something that we want to see because Chronicles and Deuteronomy have a contrasting message. And so there's, there's the end of the Old Testament of the Old Testament right there at Chronicles, not Malikai, like we would have, and through there's a pattern as the Hebrews had laid, laid this out. Now if you will take a look with me over in Second Kings 25. Second Kings 25 Here is of course, the last chapter before is that describes Israel going into captivity.

Unknown Speaker  14:37
And we want to we want to notice in Second Kings 25, verse 25, what God says about the people who have gone into captivity, second, Chrono kings, or buttons a chronicle Second Kings 25 Verse 25. All right, but he says in the seventh month, Ishmael the son of Nothing I this is after the people have already gone to captivity, the son of ally Shema of the rolly royal family, who came with 10 men and struck down get Elia and put Him to death along with the Jews and the Chaldeans who are with him at Misbah than all the people, both small and great. And the captains of the forces arose and went to Egypt, for they were afraid of the Chaldeans. Here's here is the ultimate violation of God's commandments. God had told them to stay in the land through Jeremiah, God had told them to submit themselves to Nebuchadnezzar, to the governor that he had appointed give Elia. They even refuse that murder, get Elia and head off to Egypt. Now, where is Israel? Exactly where they began. In Egypt, and in Babylon. Abraham came out of Earth, the Babylonian area, they in wind up in slavery in Egypt. And now after 1000 years, they're right back where they started from as a result of their disobedience to God. What a what a sad picture that we see there now Lotus verse 27, I hear, I want you to just think about how odd this ending is, of Second Kings. And in the 37th, year of the exile of Jehovah can king of Judah jolla can was taken into captivity and 597. So here we are 37 years later. I mean, who knows? If you if you're an Israelite, at this point, you go, who knows what the guy's even alive or not. He was a, he was a 20 something when he was taken away, and who knows what's happened to, but no kidding, he's still alive. So in the 37 deer that captivity in the 12th month, on the 27th day of the month, Devil Mara doc, king of Babylon, in that in the year that he began to reign, graciously, freed Jehovah can from g of Judah from prison, and he spoke kindly to him, and gave him a seat above the seats of the kings who were in with him in Babylon. So Jehovah can put off his prison garments and every day of his life, he dined irregularly at the Kings table, and for his allowance, a regular allowance was given him by the king, according to his daily needs, as long as he lived. Now, why is that there? That's just a crazy ending. Kings has been nothing but a disaster. And here they are finally, just completely and utterly destroyed, taken back into the captivity, where they had left, and the nation is no more. And the last words of Kings is Jehovah kin, who was, by the way, the last, rightly seated King in Judah, not Zedekiah, that a chi was, was appointed later by Nebuchadnezzar jokin was considered the actual King still alive. And Jehovah can is raised up out of his prison out of his prison garments, seated above all the other kings who have been taken captive, and then used and then given this special place, within the land within this captivity, and given a regular allowance. So here, then is, is this ending of the book? Do you see the point? A little message, you're not done yet Judah, the mercy of God is still there. Jehovah can of course, his descendants are going to end up to be Jesus Christ. And you'll see Joe again mentioned in Matthew's genealogy. So there's this little glimmer of hope, even though we are in a book, that it gives us the disaster of the curses that God would bring up on the nation when they disobey God. And this is this reminds us of the words given to David in Second Samuel chapter seven. And here are key words, let me read them for you. Listen carefully, my steadfast love.

Unknown Speaker  19:29
My steadfast love will not be taken from him that is from David, my steadfast love will not be taken from him, your house and your kingdom shall be made sure for ever. So in other words, Kings answers the question of these last little paragraph of how is it that God would still keep his promise to the descendants of David and in the midst of that Still promised to continue the curses on the nation because of their wickedness. How is that going to play out? And God gives that little blurb at the end of kings to tell us he has not forgotten his steadfast love. That's a key phrase ESV uses steadfast love other versions, mercies or loving kindness, but those are that's a covenantal term in the Old Testament, the word has sad, which is used over 200 times and the Old Testament talks about God's promises to his covenant that he would not disappoint Israel and that he would bring them to the goals that he had for them, which of course is eventually comes about for us in the covenant with Christ. All right, now, with that, let's notice something else that we would see in this and that is how there is an interesting contrast between what you see in Kings and what you see in Chronicles. So when you when you reserve Samuel and chronicles so when we read Samuel, as we have noticed, we noticed that David is, is this failure that we had so much hope for, and yet second to second Samuel centers around his sin with Bathsheba and it is the pivotal point in which this all takes place. But when we go over to Chronicles what do you what do you discover when you come to Chronicles? Well, you can search high and low in First Chronicles, which has the time period of second Sandy. And you're not going to find anything about David's sin with Bathsheba. I mean, it's just absent. There is nothing about David's sin with Bathsheba all through that text not one word. As a matter of fact, you can read about a lot of the kings of Judah even readable he highlights the good things about renewable now in and second and vegan kings you and I want to punch readable I mean man this guy is here is his father who gathered more gold than anybody could ever gather and he's not even in the in the reigning three years when Egypt comes and takes every dime of it away. I mean don't you just want to go and you're kind of remember what Solomon said in Ecclesiastes I'm going to leave this to some to to somebody else and I'm not going to know what in the world he's gonna do with it. Almost think Solomon had a good idea that RIA bomb was a doofus. It wasn't gonna work out. But but when you get into Chronicles in your late about RIA bomb, oh, there's just all kinds of excuses for why RIA bomb, he was young and, and he was easily influenced, he was 40 years old.

Unknown Speaker  23:04
But But Chronicles kinda makes it so it sounds a little better. And the whole emphasis that you see, through Chronicles is this emphasis on how Israel is to learn to worship the way the good kings worship, and the way people were supposed to serve God. And so he will go through and he'll take the Kings, even kings that we think we're not that great. And he will show how that's what I really wanted. So you have a tremendous emphasis in Chronicles, on worship, on priesthood, on the connections with David and the Messiah and the New Kingdom, and on the temple and on proper worship, and everything that's going on there is preparing this new generation that came out of captivity of the Babylonian captivity, and preparing them this is what God wants in the future. And this is what he's going to expect from people, his people in the future. So Chronicles to do a good study of Chronicles, what you will discover is yourself. In Chronicles, you will discover from Chronicles what God requires of you and me, and how this worship should go and the emphasis that we should have on how we serve God, how we worship God, and you're going to see if you look at it that way, is it going to open up an entirely different picture than just, oh, you know, that's some interesting things about some kings there and I didn't know that and it will give you a much better picture. So notice now that as we look at Chronicles, the one thing that you're going to see about David instead of the sin with Bathsheba, is that David becomes the architect of the temple. And you have this huge section, through the end of first Chronicles about all the preparation David is making for the temple. Well, I didn't know that. When I was reading Kings I didn't know I mean, and Second Samuel, I didn't know that. And yet, David is he does everything but build the temple, he not only is the architect, but he lays out how the Levites are to worship and how, how they are to lead the people and, and he divides them up into singers and, and songwriters and instrument users and, and he has the whole temple plan so that when his son, Solomon, takes the throne, oh, Solomon Psalms got the blueprint. All Solomon has to do is say, all right, to get to building. And in fact, David lays out so much and and of course, his prophets like Nathan, etcetera, give him these, these patterns that from that time on for hundreds of years, people will still go back to David's pattern on how the temple is to be run, how the Levites are to play the instruments, who's supposed to do the singing, things like that. So it sets forth a pattern that David lays out. And as that significant, of course, it is because David is a type of Christ, and Christ is going to come and he's going to up the ante on that. And he is going to lay out worship for his new kingdom, just as David did for that Temple period. And so that is going to be significant as well. Now, as we said, the sin of David is not mentioned that it was built with Bathsheba and Chronicles, but there is a sin that is mentioned the sin of numbering the people. Now that's interesting, I'd like you to notice that if you'll take a look and verse Chronicles, Chapter 21. First Chronicles chapter 21. And we will begin reading at at verse 22. Now, most of you, I'm sure remember, the situation in which

Unknown Speaker  27:20
David fell to the temptation incited by Satan fell to the temptation of numbering the people. And you might think, Well, what was the problem with numbering the people? Well, it was fine if you were numbering the people to go into battle. But David was not numbering the people to go into a battle, like the book of Numbers is David was numbering the people as a self exultation. And God in fact, was we were just given little information on this. But God, in fact, was angry with Israel. And and so God use this incident as a punishment, and a curse on the nation. So we usually read it from the Kings record. Now we'll look a little bit about it from the Chronicles record verse 22. And David said to Oren, and give me the sight of the threshing floor, that I may build on it and altar to the Lord give it to me as at its full price, that the plague may be averted from the people. So the plague is spreading across the land. David kind of gets ahead of it as it's spreading and just killing people. And David says, it says to Oren and you, you got to sell me this right now we're in and says, oh, I'll just give it to you. David says, no, no, I will not use what I have not made my own sacrifice and he's paid for it. And then he builds this altar there. Okay, so verse 23, then on and said to David, take it and let my lord the king do what seems good to him. See, I've given the oxygen for the burn offering and the threshing sledges for the wood and the wheat for the grain offering I give it all but King David said Dornan No. But I will buy them for full price I will not take for the Lord, what is yours, nor offer burnt offerings that cost me nothing. It's a whole sermon right there in there. I will not offer what doesn't, what does not cost me anything. That's significant. And that's not the point of my lesson. But I just want to make a note of that, that we all need to think carefully about that. Verse 25. So David paid Oren and 600 shekels of gold by wait for the site. And David built there an altar to the Lord and presented burn offerings and peace offerings, and called on the Lord and the Lord answered him with fire from heaven, up on the altar of burnt offering. Then the Lord commanded the angel and he put his sword back into its sheath. Alright, note the significance of this upleg is sweeping across the land and day Even comes to the site where or Nan is he buys the land. He buys the animals and he offers the offering. And as soon as he does fire comes down from heaven, and burns up the offering. And the angel Lord is told to to depart from this and he puts his sheath back and the plague is stopped. Why is the plague stopped? Because Israel is just such a wonderful nation. No, because Judah was so great, not because David is so great, no,

Unknown Speaker  30:36
because of the mercy of the Lord, because of the steadfast love of Lord because God made a unilateral promise, both with Abraham and with David, that he would keep covenant with him. And even if his descendants transgressed his word, he would punish them, but he would never remove from them. His steadfast love and always have a king upon the throne, and his descendants would reign. That's because of the promise of God. You and I fit within that you and I fit within the curse of the law, the curse of sin, you and I fit within that. And there's only one reason that God has saved us from our sins, and is because he made promises to Abraham and to David, that his steadfast love would never depart. And you and I are the recipients of that. And this is a critical little point that we read over very, very easily. And Miss. Now watch what happens in verse 28. At that time, when David saw that the Lord had answered him, at the threshing floor of orange and the Jebusite, he sacrificed there for the tabernacle Lord, which Moses had made in the wilderness on the altar of burnt offering, were at that time, in the high place, Gibson. But David could not go before it to inquire of God, for he was afraid of the sword of the angel of the Lord, ignore chapter divisions, then David said, Here shall be the house of the Lord God. And here the altar of burnt offering for Israel is an interesting that this site where he purchases the land here, and he purchased the site, and he offers the offering becomes the site of the temple that Solomon will build. It becomes the site where the mercy of God is portrayed for the nation. And so when Solomon comes along, and he builds the temple, you see this happening right here. This is that critical point where God stops the on saw the onslaught of the curses, and commits himself to his steadfast love, even toward a wicked people even toward a wicked king, and keeps his mercy. And the temple is built on this site, which stands then in a shadow for eventually, the coming of Christ, and the great sacrifice, of course, that Jesus made for us. So when we read the story of kings, we end with just a little glimpse of hope and Jehovah can and we read the Chronicles, we see a even greater hope as the Chronicles transition to this mercy of God. Now let's take this one step further. I would like you to consider the story of Manasa. Let's go back to Kings. And let's take a look at Second Kings chapter 21. Second Kings chapter 21. A lot of our children's classrooms have the little pictures of the kings with their sad face or their smiley face. And I've always wanted to go up and make Monascus face just uglier than it really is.

Unknown Speaker  34:26
I admit I don't like that man. It is a horrifying story when we read about Manasa so look at Second Kings 21 Verse 10. And the Lord said to his servants, the prophets because Manasa king of Judah with has committed these abominations, and has done these things more evil than all the Amorites did, who were before him. It has made Judah also sin with his idols. So the Amorites Of course, being the Canaanites before Israel entered Canaan. Therefore, this says the LORD the God of his Israel Behold I am bringing upon Jerusalem and Judah such disaster that the ears of everyone who hears it will tingle and I will stretch over Jerusalem, the measuring line of Samaria, the plumb line of the house of Ahab course referring to the fall of the northern kingdom, and that will wipe Jerusalem as one wipes a dish, wiping it and turning it upside down. And I will forsake the remnant of my heritage and give them into the hand of their enemies and they should become a prey and a spoil to all their enemies, because they have done what is evil in my sight. And it provoked me to anger since the day that their fathers came out of Egypt even to this day. Moreover, Manasa shed very much innocent blood till he had filled Jerusalem from one end to another, besides the sin that he made Judas sin so that they did what was evil in the sight of the Lord. When you think about living in Jerusalem dinner during the monastics day, Woe to you, if you are a righteous person. He's going to kill you. Woe to you, if he's going to kill you. Not to mention all the little babies that he burned up to the god Molek and how the people did the same thing. It is an absolute amazing sight. If any of us think well, things are kind of bad today. We haven't seen anything compared to what had gone on during the reign of demand. Manasa look at chapter 23 of Second Kings and verse 24. Now here is the reforms of Josiah you remember Josiah comes along a number of years later, and Josiah is the is the last good king. And we Oh goody. And Josiah makes all these reforms and all these changes. And in verse 24 of chapter 23. Notice what he says about Josiah and verse 24. Moreover, just I have put away the mediums and the Necromancer 's and the household gods and the idols, and all the abominations that were seen in land of Judah and Jerusalem, that he might establish the words of the law that were written in the Book of Hilkiah, the priests found in the house of the Lord. Before him, there was no king like him, who turned to the Lord with all his heart, and with all his soul, and with all his mind, according to all the law of Moses, nor did any like him arise after him. Still, the Lord did not turn from the burning of his great wrath by which his anger was kindled against Judah, because of all the provocations with which Manasa had provoked him. And the Lord said, I'll remove Judah also out of my sight. As I've removed Israel, I will cast off the city that I've chosen Jerusalem, and the house which I said, my name shall be there, what a shocking statement. Manasa is long gone, Josiah comes in and changes everything and gets people back to serving God. And God is like, great, but I'm not changing my mind. Because of the wickedness that of Manasa committed, I will bring punishment, the curse must be fulfilled. And we just shut her. We said, but but but Josiah, but Manasa and God pronounces these curses in chapter 24 And verse one. In those days Nebuchadnezzar king of Babylon came up a Jehovah Kim became his servant three years, then he turned and rebelled against Him, and the Lord sinned against him, bands of the Chaldeans bands of the Assyrians bands of the Moabites bands of the Ammonites, and sent them against Judah to destroy it according to the Word of the Lord that He spoke by his servants the prophets. Surely this came up on Judah, at the command of the Lord to remove them out of his sight. Watch this for the sins of Manasa according to all that he had done, and also for the innocent blood that he had shed for he had filled Jerusalem within his in blood and the Lord would not pardon. There's the story of Manasa in the Book of Kings, but you know, it's a little different in Chronicles, don't you? Let's go over to Chronicles. Take a look and Second Chronicles chapter 33.

Unknown Speaker  39:21
Second Chronicles chapter 3333, verse one and two, we have an introduction to Manasa as rain, and as I was 12 years old and began to rain, the rain 55 years in Jerusalem he did what was evil in the sight of the Lord. According to the abominations the nation's and the Lord drove out before the people of Israel and of course, he goes on to describe all that just like we have read in the kings. Look down in verse 11. Therefore, the Lord brought upon them the commanders of the armies of the king of Assyria, who captured Manasa and with hooks and bow him with chains of bronze, and brought him to Babylon. And when he was in distress, he entreated the favor of the Lord his God and humbled himself greatly before the God of his father's. He prayed to Him. And God was moved by his entreaty and heard his plea, and brought him again to Jerusalem into His kingdom. Then Manasseh knew that the Lord was God. Afterward, he built an outer wall for the City of David West, a guy Han, and he talks about the good things that he did. And he took away in verse 15, the foreign gods and the out of them, the house, the Lord, all the altars he had built at cetera. Now look down at verse 18. Now the rest of the acts of NASA, and his prayer to his God, and the words of the seers, who spoke to him in the name of the Lord, the God of Israel, behold, they're in the chronicles of the kings of Israel, and his prayer, and how God was moved by his injury, and all his sins, and his faithlessness and the sites in which he built the high places instead of the ashram and the images before he humbled himself. Behold, they are written in The Chronicles of the Sears universe, those words, God was moved with his prayer.

Unknown Speaker  41:32
Would you have been moved by the prayer minutes? I don't like that man. He murdered and murdered and murdered and murdered. I mean, it's just hard to think of anybody else in the whole Old Testament that could be worse.

Unknown Speaker  42:03
And God punished him, took him into Babylon. And he humbled himself. And when he humbled himself and prayed, God was moved. The heart of the Lord moved to bless Manasa and bless the nation.

Unknown Speaker  42:25
How do you read them? There's only one way to read it. The steadfast love of the Lord would never depart. And God in spite of the worst of the worst centers.

Unknown Speaker  42:49
When the people would turn and pray, God would listen. How about a center are you I'm a bad one. We're all bad ones. You go, how do you see a bad senator? You're a sinner, aren't you? You're a sinner, you're a bad sinner. The Curse of the Lord is on all who sin and fall short of the glory of God. But God made a promise that if we would turn to Him, His steadfast love would never depart. And he fulfills that. And our great Savior Jesus, a descendant

Unknown Speaker  43:52
from Manasa. A descendant descendent from Jehovah can and Jesus comes and does, but we could not do. Now once you consider something the purpose in Chronicles of all the detailed preparations David made for the temple.

Unknown Speaker  44:19
What happened when Solomon came and followed the pattern, the blueprint of David and built the temple and everything was put in order right down to the very detail what happened. Glory the Lord filled the house remember, just like happened when the temple when the attempt of the tabernacle was built? What what happened? The glory the Lord filled the tent. And so when when Solomon finished David's temple, basically, the glory the Lord filled the temple and then what happened? The Babylonians came and leveled it and took everything away. And then the people are given the blessing of coming back out of captivity and 536 BCE and Zedekiah. I mean, excuse me, Zerubbabel begins the the journey of rebuilding the temple and it's finally built in 516 BC. And when the temple is built, what happens? Nothing but glory of the Lord does not fill the temple is a shocking blank in the story, we're expecting the glory of the Lord to fill the temple, but it is not. Instead, we read in Malikai chapter three and verse one, a prophecy Malikai chapter three and verse one. And Malikai prophesize Behold, I send My messenger, and He'll prepare the way before me we recognize that as John the Baptist, and the Lord whom you seek will suddenly come to His temple, and the messenger of the covenant and whom you delight, Behold, he is coming, says the Lord of OST. But who can endure the day of his coming and who could stand when he appears for he is like a refiners fire and like Fullers soap, he will sit as a refiner and purifier of silver, and He will purify the sons of Levi and refine them like gold and silver, and they will bring offerings in righteousness to the Lord, then the offering of Judah and Jerusalem will be pleasing to the Lord as in the days of old and informer years, and I will draw near to you in judgment, I'll bring swift witness against the sorcerers, against the adulterers, against those who swear falsely against those who oppress the higher worker in his wages, the widow and the fatherless those who are who thrust aside the sojourner. And do not fear Me, says the Lord of hosts. Now, let's just ask this question What happened when Jesus burst on the scene? And when you see the story of Jesus entering the temple, what do you see? You see them rejecting Him. They rejected the true temple. And what is Jesus when he What does he do when he enters? He cleanses the temple, he throws out the robbers he throws out those who did he cleanses it? Does he cleanse it? Because that physical temple is where the glory of the Lord is? No. He cleanses it because it is a foreshadowing of the fact that he is cleansing the nation and he becomes the new temple. Do you remember in the second chapter of the book of John after Jesus turns the water to wine, which was a picture of the blessings that were going to come from the New Covenant and the people, the the Jew, the Pharisees and Sadducees said to him, you know, what, what, what do you think you're doing here and coming in here this way and cleansing the temple, and he says, tear down this temple. And in three days, I will raise it up. And they thought he was talking about the physical temple. And John says, No years later, we figured out he is talking about the Temple of his body. Why that figure? Because Jesus becomes the new temple. His body becomes the temple. Who are you? First Corinthians 360, do you not know you're the temple of the Holy Spirit? Who is in First Corinthians 619? Do you not know that your body is the temple of the Holy Spirit? Who is in second Corinthians chapter six, and verse 14, and following, cleanse yourselves of the of the impurities, because God is now going to dwell with you and dwell in Your presence, the glory of the Lord has now filled the true temple,

Unknown Speaker  49:20
which is you and me. What's the result? The result of that is that we now are the individuals through whom the glory of God shines to the world. Israel profaned his name in Israel profaned him in the temple was destroyed, and they went into the nations and they profaned His name among the nations and God promised me Ezekiel 36 that he would bring a new people sprinkled clean water on them, put his spirit within them and change them and cause them to be careful to obey his commandments and his rules and from them His name would be glorified. The story of Deuteronomy, and the story of the Old Testament is actually two stories. It's not one story. It's two stories. The first story is the story of the Law of Moses, the covenant made at Mount Sinai, which second Corinthians chapter three says, is a ministry of death. And it is proven out by that story of Joshua through kings. But there's a second story. And the second story is about the covenant God made with David, and God made with Abraham. And that story is about the steadfast love of the Lord. And that is the covenant that you and I rejoice in. We rejoice in a covenant relationship with God, that even though we are sinners, the steadfast love of the Lord will never depart from us. And He will change us and He will create us new and cleanse us so that we can live to the praise of his glory. The stories of Deuteronomy, and the story of David contrasting stories that are laid side by side, and the reason Chronicles is the true ending of the Old Testament. We're gonna sing a song right now. You want to take part in the steadfast love of the Lord, you have that opportunity to turn to him to Jesus, do as Jesus commanded. turn from your sin, repent of your sins, be immersed in water for the forgiveness of your sins, and enjoy a life in the steadfast love of God to glorify Him forever. If you're subject to that we invite you to God wildest Bobby standards.
