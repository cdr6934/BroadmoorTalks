Good evening, it's good to see each of you, you might want to be turning your Bibles to Jeremiah, the first chapter, Jeremiah chapter one. This next quarter, what are the topics that we'll be studying in our Adult Bible class would be the book of Jeremiah. And it is a extremely long book. In fact, it's the longest book in the Bible, by good measure. And it's impossible for us really to do justice to everything within the book within a single quarter of study. So I'm going to take the opportunity, as a habit over the next few months to when I speak, probably we speak unto you also from the book of Jeremiah, get a double dose of that way. I think there's a lot of great lessons to be found in Jeremiah and I hope that the lesson tonight will be of some value to us as we seek to please our God, and serve him each day of our lives.

Curtis Byers  00:59
Let's read the first three verses of Jeremiah chapter one. The text says the words of Jeremiah the son of Hilkiah, one other priests who were in addeth, off in the land of Benjamin, to whom the word of the Lord came in the days of Josiah, the son of Amman, King or Judah in the 13th year of his reign, and also came in the days of Jehovah become the son of Josiah king of Judah. And until the end of the 11th, year of Zedekiah, the son of Josiah king of Judah, until the captivity of Jerusalem, in the fifth month, were told in these introductory verses, that Jeremiah was one of the priests that he was his father anyway was one of the priests. We have no knowledge of Jeremiah ever. Serving as a priest, he, he his duty was, as he was called to be a prophet. But he was he was a family of the priest. But we're also told in these introductory verses, the timeframe in which he spoke, you'll notice that there are three kings that are mentioned. And if you look at the last five kings, that rule there in Judah, the ones that are mentioned are Josiah Jehovah come in Zedekiah. Three of those five. Now, probably the reason that Jehoahaz and Jehovah chin are not mentioned, they only rain for three months before they were deposed. And so there's not much said about them in the scriptures. We do know some things but there's not much time, I should say at least, that Jeremiah can prophesy during those days and whatever he might have in there. Just not spoken much about those timeframes. The other kings ruled for a fairly lengthy period of time, both Jehoahaz excuse me, Jehol come is that a kya? Rain for 11 years, and Josiah rain for 31 years. First, Josiah was one of the youngest to ever ascend to the throne. He was only 49 years old, I believe. No, 39 years old. When he when he dies, he was a young man, he went in his death. We're told that it was the 13th year of Josiah when Jeremiah began to prophesy. As we studied the book, we'll learn that he continued to prophesy until well after the destruction of Jerusalem. And so he prophesied for roughly 40 years, a fairly long period of time, essentially the same length of time that Isaiah prophesied. Just to remind you, he will spend time on this tonight. But it was during Jehovah comes time period, in fact that the end of his three month reign was when the first importation was taken into babblin. That was 11 years later, when, several years later when Jehoiachin was taken into captivity with the second group of captives. And then the third captivity, deportation was when Nebuchadnezzar destroyed through Islam to the ground in 586. Tonight, I want us to look at Jeremiah chapter seven. So you might turn over to Jeremiah, chapter seven. This is the A when the first part of this chapter is what we call the temple sermon. It's obviously as you'll see here in a minute. In the Jeremiah seven, we're not told exactly when this sermon was delivered. Many of the things within Jeremiah are we are told at the timeframe in which they took place. In fact, one of the unique things about Jeremiah compared to the other prophets, is how many historical references and how many historical narratives that we are given within the book and it's a wonderful book to read and study. But there is over in Jeremiah 26, which is making note of this and Jeremiah 26. There's another sermon that sounds a whole lot like this sermon, and facts from so much so that many people think they are the same or different records of the same sermon and that sermon in Jeremiah 26 is dated to the beginning of the reign of Jehovah. So that's where I've placed it there. Besides your Holcomb, this is most likely the timeframe in which these words were spoken. So let's, let's read the first three verses of Jeremiah chapter seven, we'll be going all the way down to verse 15. But let's just start looking at the first three verses.

Curtis Byers  05:37
Notice the text says that the word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord, stand in the gate of the Lord's house and proclaim their this word, and say, Here the word of the Lord, all you men of Judah, who introduced gays to worship God, Thus says the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, that mend your ways in your deeds, and I will let you dwell in this place. The first thing I will note is, notice, the words that Jeremiah spoke are the words that God gave him the spoke, Jeremiah did not go out on his own initiative, and say those things that he thought were appropriate. Prophets didn't do that. true prophets didn't do that. A true prophet of God is one who's given the words of God who handles them faithfully. And he faithfully speaks those words that he was given. Now, notice, Jeremiah was told to go to the gate of the temple, as people were going back and forth, in and out of the temple to worship. Jeremiah was to stand there at the gate, and to say these words, as people was entering into worship. These are things that the Lord wanted His people to know, before they went in to worship. In other words, these are important words. And a verse three, the essence of this sermon is given their verse three where it says, that says, the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, and mend your ways in your deeds, and I will let you dwell in this place. Jeremiah is calling for repentance. And we'll see in some more detail on that in just a moment. But the Jeremiah tells them that if you amend your ways, the Lord says that he will let them live in this place. That's the way the translation, the ESV reads. There is another way of translating this last phrase. Most of you know, I think that the Hebrew language when written did not contain vowels, and only the consonants were written down. And the reader as he would read the texts, he would have to understand the context and the text well enough to be able to insert the appropriate vowels to come up with the right words. Now, if you're listening to the speaker, if you were there in Jeremiah's day, there'll be no confusion. It's only the written text, that might give some confusion. So this very last phrase where it says, I will let you dwell in this place, you can take those very same consonants, and make up this phrase, or Let me dwell with you in this place. And a couple of translations of our translations translated that way. There that is a difference. Either the Lord is promising that they will be able to continue to dwell, or the Lord is promising that He will dwell with them in the land. Now, those are two obviously very related ideas, but they are different ideas. The exact same phrase occurs that verse seven as well, we'll read that in a moment. But in verse seven, the exact same phrase occurs. And so that same confusion, or uncertainty as to what has been said, is there as well. Now you'll notice that ESV, again, uses what I would call the traditional reading, I will let you dwell on this place. Then RSV takes the alternate reading. But the New American Bible, which took the alternate reading in the first instance, takes a traditional reading and the second instance. So is this really somewhat confusing? Exactly maybe what the Lord is saying there's like four options, and three of them are found within these three translations. Let's not worry about that. For now. Just keep that in the back of your mind. And we'll come back and I'm talking about that later, if I remember to talk about it later. But just understand that there's a little bit of difference in that. I'm going to take the traditional reading for our purposes, where he says that if you will mend your ways, I will let you dwell in this place. Let's go ahead and read verses four through 15, though to get the rest of the sermon in Man. First of all, do not trust in these deceptive words. This is the temple of the Lord, the tip of the law or the temple of Lord. For if you truly a man your ways in your deeds if you truly execute justice with one another, if you do not oppress the sojourner, the fatherless will widdle or shed innocent blood in his place. And if you do not go after other gods to your own harm, then I will let you dwell on this place and the land that I gave of old to your father's forever. Behold, you trust in deceptive words, to no avail.

Curtis Byers  10:39
Will you still murder committed adultery, swear falsely, make offerings to bail and go after other gods that you have not known. And then come and stand before me in this house, which is called by my name and say, We are delivered. Only to go on doing all these abominations has this house, which is called by my name, become a dinner robbers in your eyes. Behold, I myself have seen it declares the lower. Go now to my place that was in Shiloh where I made my name, dwell at first and see what I did to it because of the evil of my people, Israel. And now because you have done all these things, declares the Lord. And when I spoke to you persistently, you did not listen. And when I called you You did not answer. Therefore I will go to the house that is called by my name and wish you trust into the place that I will give you into your father's as I did to Shiloh. And I will cast you out of my sight as I cast out your kinsmen all the offspring of Ephraim. The Lord is fairly clear, I will say in his message, he outlines itemizes the things that they have done. And because they have done those things, it is only proper right that they be driven out of the land. And the Lord says he will do that. He did it at Shiloh, he did it to the northern tribes, called Ephraim here. And he will do it again. But he's offering, but he's offering them the chance to repent and turn back to him. Now, as you are noticing all these things, that the charges that were brought against them, didn't even come to mind. Notice, they're not depressed, the stranger, the fathers or the widow. They were not to shed innocent blood. They were not to go after other gods or make offerings to bail. They were not to steal, they were not to murder. They were not to commit adultery, and they were not to swear falsely. Does that list bring anything to mind? As you think about that particular list of things? I think it probably does. You know, does that remind you the commandments that God gave to them at Sinai? You know, if you look at the list on the left and look at the list on the right, you know, it seems like most of those are covered in one shape, form or fashion. Now I'm going to stretch it a little bit oppressing the widow I will say cutters like dishonouring one's father and mother could be it depends on the widow was paired or not? Certainly in same thing. So it seems as if the Lord is saying, Look what what you have you ever violated my commandments. And what's the significance of the 10 commandments to the Jewish people? Remember, it was the 10 commandments, only the 10 commandments, that the Lord wrote with his own finger, took his own hand and wrote these commandments down. They're oftentimes called the words of the covenant. The 10 commandments, in particular, were the covenant rules that God had given his people that they would have to abide by if they were going to continue to dwell in the land. But if they broke his covenants, if he broke the Commandments or disobey the commandments, and the covenant said that God would

Curtis Byers  14:24
drive them out of the land. And he's making their case he's making the case against them. You've broken the covenant, you broken the terms of the covenant is only right and proper that you'd be driven out of the land. Now, the fact that I've kind of put a little checkmark down, but each of those may feed into the impression that some have that, you know, the old law was just a matter of doing certain things. It's kind of like a checklist. Well, that's not the case. In fact, even within this own passage itself, if you notice In Verse five, those what the law says, For it is not just only that you have to mend your ways, you have to truly amend your ways. And if you truly execute justice with one another, the heart has always been part of God's expectations. Well, we do what God wants us to do, our heart has to be sincere. Our heart has to be telling us that this is what we ought to be doing. And we're doing it for the right reason. We're not doing it to be seen of others. We're not doing it just because we can put a checkmark beside it. We're doing it because it is the right thing. And we are doing it because our God and Father father thinks and acts in those ways. And we are to emulate him and we are to sincerely follow him. The heart has always been an expectation, a part of God's expectations of his people of all time. But I want us to focus upon verse four in particular. And as repeated in part in verse eight, where Jeremiah says at the beginning of this list, he says, Do not trust and these deceptive words, the temple of the Lord, the temple will lower the temple lowered. Be further down to verse eight. He says, Behold, you trust in deceptive words, to no avail. What is this repetition of this phrase, the temple Lord intended to mean? Well, first of all, the repetition itself may be simply a way of emphasizing. There's some disagreement about this as many things, but it may be simply a rhetorical way of putting emphasis. Not only did the Hebrews not include the vowels, they had no punctuation, so they couldn't put an exclamation point at the end of a sentence. So one way of making something stand out and highlighting it would be to repeat it. And so it may be simply that repetition is to highlight this phrase, the tip of the Lord. But what did what is going on here? What does what do they mean, when they're calling upon or make an allusion to the temple of the Lord? Well, I think we can answer that question with some certainty. But to answer that question, we really need to go back and understand what the temple symbolizes, and what was the role that the temple played. And to understand that we need to go back to the time that the temple was built and the time of Solomon. So one has to go back and look at some passages and we'll start in Second Chronicles seven, just to see what was said about the temple, and the days and wish it were was built and dedicated these this particular passage and Second Chronicles seven, comes right after Solomon had dedicated the temple so the construction of the temple is complete. Solomon has a wonderful dedication and all of chapter six, where he rehearses the background to David wanting to do it but God not allowing David to do it and him doing it. And this says invert, he gives a prayer there is his dedication. So in verse one of Second Chronicles seven, it says, As soon as Solomon finished his prayer, fire came down from heaven and consumed the burnt offerings and sacrifices and glory of the Lord filled the temple. Just pause there for a second. Do you think God was pleased with what was going on? On that day on that dedication of the temple? Yes, God Himself sinned far down from heaven to consume the burnt offerings. What does that remind you of? Goes back to Elijah and and those four and the prophets of bale right where God and God clearly was approving of what was taking place that day. And it says that the glory of the Lord filled the temple. It's going to read

Curtis Byers  19:12
it says in the priests cannot enter the house of law because of glory. The Lord filled the Lord's house with all the people of Israel saw the fire come down in the glory of the Lord for the temple, they bowed down with their faces to the ground on the pavement, and worship and gave thanks to the Lord saying, For He is good for his steadfast love. That's his covenant love, his steadfast love endures forever. The temple was the dwelling place of God, right? It's where God's glory dwelt, is where God was said to dwell, was even a little more clear, I think over a little later in the same chapter of verses 15 through 16. There's Solomon says, now my eyes will be open my ears attentive, speaking of God, On God's eyes, his ears will be tempted to prayer that has made in this place, for Adele have chosen and consequently consecrated this house, that my name may be there forever. If God's name is there, that means God is there, my eyes and my heart will be there for all time God is telling the people, that He will dwell there in this place. In Psalms 132, I don't know exactly what the Psalm was written, but the language is clear. For the Lord has chosen Zion, he has desired it for His dwelling place. This is my resting place forever. Here I will dwell for I have desired it. I will abundantly bless her provisions, I will satisfy her poor with bread, her praise, I will close this salvation her saints was shelter for joy. There I will make a horn to sprout for David I have prepared a lamb for my anointing his enemies I will close with shame. But on his on his crown up excuse me on him his crown will shine the temple was God's dwelling place. So what do you think then when the people of Josiah is in Jeremiah's day? We're saying the Temple Law or the Temple of law or the temple of Lord, what were they assuming to be the case? It's so much so that Jeremiah says that those are deceptive words, those are lying words? Well, I think it's pretty clear that they assume that says God said He would dwell in this place that he God was continuing to dwell even in their day, and that place. And as of Psalm 132, says, If God is willing there, then there are going to be blessings. And so they were putting their trust, right? They were putting their trust in the fact that God was still among them. His temple was still standing, therefore, God was still there. And if God was still there, then they could be assured that no harm would come to them. Now the temple was built back in the nine hundreds, okay? We're now down in the five, late five hundreds BCE. Well, 100 years earlier, before Jeremiah, there was another prophet Micah who spoke. And even in his day, the people had the same attitude, that look at this passage of Micah three, verse 11. There says, is his home at the heads of the people give judgment for bribe? Is priest teach for price is prophets practice divination for money, yet they lean on the Lord and say, is not the Lord in the midst of us? Know disaster will come upon us. This apparently was the same message that the false prophets and Jeremiah day was prophesied the Lord's houses here, isn't he still among us? No disaster will come upon us. Now, let's pause and think about this more carefully, know more carefully about what these false prophets were doing. They were starting off with something that the Lord has said, I'm using the Psalms with 32 passages, I could use the other passages, but they're starting off with what the, what the Lord said they could give book chapter verse, In other words, for the position for the understanding, that God will bless His people because God dwells within the temple. Right? That is something that God had promised. And that is something that they accepted as true. And therefore they concluded from that, that the Lord still here, the temple is still here, Lord is still here. And no disaster is going to come upon us. As at a fair reading, I mean, that on the surface that seems to be fairly accurate reading of what the Lord has said earlier, to speak to His prophets.

Curtis Byers  24:13
But Jeremiah says, you know, yes, you know, God said, he would dwell with you here. That's the truth. But what did Jeremiah said that was the conclusion that they came up with the conclusion, I came up with a lie. Those were deceptive words. Those were a lot. How do they where did they go wrong? What happened in their understanding going from what God said to what they were currently believing and teaching? Well, they were selective, right? They were selective, and they're under remembrance of what God has said. The devil himself when he tempted Jesus, what was what did he do in each of his three temptations? When he was trying to get Jesus to do something that was wrong? He quoted Scripture, but they were the promises Aiden's quoting scripture, he doesn't tell you everything, he only tells you those things that he wants to tell you. And that's what these false prophets do. They were being selected, they forgot to talk about the covenant. At the very beginning of Israel's history, when God called them out to be a people, the covenant was conditional. If you will obey me, if you will do my commandments, if you will honor me, then I will let you live in the land. But if you don't, I will drive you. They were only looking at the good side, as if they were obeying God and not looking at the other side of the equation. The context back there when the psalmist was speaking, it was referring to the time of Solomon in the early years of Solomon when the temple was built. We don't read any idolatry as being a problem among God's people at that time, I'm sure there may have been some but on hold, that wasn't the case. There was no the people were wholly devoted to the Lord God accepted their worship that day, when they came together and dedicated the temple. But what was the context? At the time that Jeremiah was speaking? Well, this is 40 years later. And the people have departed from the Lord idolatry of bounded everywhere. Baal worship was prevalent. And even though Josiah and Hezekiah before him and some other dead kings had made efforts to expel him from the land, it obviously is still part of their society. Baal worship was still going on. It was endemic to the land, the context has changed. I would just pause there and make make the point. Because I think it's a very important principle of Bible interpretation. That before we can understand any particular thing we read in the Bible, we have to understand the context. The fact I think it would not be a stretch to say that the first three rules are Bible and interpretation is context, context and context. Right? It's absolutely impossible to understand the meaning of any particular passage in scripture, without a clear understanding of his context. And when I say context, what does we think of simply in terms of well, what are the few verses ahead and the few verses below say, and that's very important, but I'm talking even broader than that. What is the life situation in which the words are given? What's the condition of the people to whom they are, to whom the words are written, we have to first come to understanding of what the scripture is meant to the people to whom it was written in their setting. And if we properly understand that, well, then we can have a chance, perhaps, of seeing how those words apply to us. Oftentimes, it seems like in some Bible studies, I've seen that we're so anxious to see how scripture is applied to us, we don't do the first step, which is the really the harder step. The first step is saying, Well, what they really mean, back in the time in which it was written, and to the people to whom it was written, how were they to understand what God said, if we can understand what they said, then we have a chance of understanding how, if at all, whether or not applies to us. And I would even suggest, Bible class teachers give thought about that when you're teaching your Bible classes. If we only spend 10 minutes, is kind of giving the background to the passage, and then we spend the next 40 minutes talking about application, I think we may have that backwards, we probably want to spend the first 40 minutes talking about what the passage means. And then if we've had time, let's talk give the 10 minutes to talking about the applications that mean, now, Bible classes are not the complete of our study. We have preachers who preach and most of the time preachers are focusing upon application and that's probably appropriate.

Curtis Byers  29:12
But let's make sure that we always do the necessary work of first understanding what it passage means in this context. And that's that's the hard part. Well, I want to ask another question, though. You know, where did the tempo come from? What was the origins of the temple itself? The temple had, obviously in Joseph, Jeremiah's day had gotten to the point that it was actually a stumbling block. Because the people was pointing to the temple and saying, because the temple is here, then the Lord is here. And if the Lord is here, then we're safe. Right? Why was there a temple in the first place? I'm sure you remember a second Samuel seven I want to just read this quickly and make a few observations. This is talking about David. Now when the king has David lived in his house and the Lord had given him rest walls surrounding me, he's, the king said to Nathan the prophet. See now, I dwell in a house of cedar, David had just completed building himself a grand house, right? So he says, I dwell in a house of cedar, but the ark of God dwells in a tent with a tail was a tabernacle. Remember the tabernacle, right? The tabernacle was what was constructed back, you know, long time ago, when the people came out of Egypt. And it was constructed according to them to the guidelines of God, God, given all the instructions about the details of the tabernacle, and the materials of which was to be made and what it was to compete consist of, and all that the people of God continue to worship in that tent for 400 years, well, no longer that go back 800 years not yours at this point. They had been worshipping in that tent for a long time. So But David says, the ark of the Lord will go God who wasn't had a 10 a 10. And Dave, Nathan said to the king, go, do all that is in your heart for the Lord is with you Nathan's a prophet. But that same night, the word of the Lord came to Nathan, go and tell my servant David, Thus says the Lord, would you build me a house to dwell in? I have not lived in the house since the day I brought up the people of Israel from Egypt to this day. But I've been moving about an attempt for my dwelling. And all the places where I have moved with all the people of Israel that I speak a word with any of the judges of Israel, whom I commanded to shepherd my people Israel, saying, Why have you not built me a house of cedar? Now, first observation, I think, is, I think David was sincere, and had an honest desire and good intent to do something that he thought the Lord would be pleased with. He thought it proper that the Lord dwell in a tent. In fact, in that we talked about the dedication that over the tabernacle, excuse me, the temple later, and Solomon even says there that the Lord said that it was well that for David to think of such a thing. So the intent of David was good, and it was a good thing. But it's also clear from reading this, that the Lord never intended for anyone to build him a house. That never crossed his mind. He never asked it. He never told the people to do it. He was content to live and dwell within the tent that he had told them to build for him, originally. And thirdly, I think we can see from this that had David just gone ahead and done it. He would have been wrong. In fact, Lord does not let David build a temple. He does concede, and allow his son Solomon to build it. He doesn't allow David to build it. So if David had not been wise, to go to the Lord first and ask, he would have been wrong, and just doing what he thought was the best thing he had been doing, he went wrong in that.

Curtis Byers  33:28
I want us to think about this question. Was it a good thing for the people of Israel to have the temple? Was the temple a blessing? Or was it a stumbling block? Now we're talking about the temple where there's only three temples we got to think about first, the temple that Solomon built, the one we're talking about here. And this temple has a magnificent structure and magnificent building fact. David intends for it to be so in First Chronicles 22, verse five, David is speaking there. He says, Solomon, my son is young and inexperienced, and the house that is to be built for the Lord must be exceedingly magnificent of fame and glory throughout all lands, I will therefore make preparation for it. So David provided materials in great quantity before his death. Now David was told by the Lord over First Chronicles 28th, Lord did tell David, the plan of the temple and the other things that were associated with the temple. But clearly it was it was David's desire to make the temple magnificent. And the same thing could be said of Solomon. And Second Chronicles, the second chapter, Solomon is speaking, and he says, the house that I am to build will be great for it Our God is greater than all gods. That's a good reason, isn't it? We serve a great God and therefore the house in which God is to dwell, should be a great house. Well, this great house, which was inlaid, in fact, we're told there if you go through the details all the inside of the temple, all the cedar was overlaid with gold, and all the trappings in the furniture and such things such like in the temple was overlaid with gold or some bronze door somewhere, but there was mostly gold inside of this temple. Well, that magnificent temple, over the period of the 400 years from the time it was built, until the time of Jeremiah's day, could even go back 100 years to the time of Michael's day, had become kind of a rabbit's foot for the people was lucky charm. That's what they thought of the temple. They were going in and making offerings to God while at the same time, they would also make offerings to bail on their way to the temple. It was just they just kind of included the worship of God, along with the worship of the other gods, they just put them all together and just treat them all as if it was saying their their view of the temple was purely physical. And the physical presence was what was of importance to them. Well, you know, that temple was destroyed, we're gonna be studying Jeremiah that God does Destroy this temple by the hand of Nebuchadnezzar. And seven years later, and people come back under resorbable. And they are, again, they build a temple. They were not told a whole lot about this temple, but we think we can safely say that is a much more humble structure, a more humble building. In fact, over and Hagar Hagar was one of the prophets who prophesied during this period. He says this, who is left among you who saw this house in his former glory, there were a stone, who came back, who had once lived previously before the Solomon's Temple was destroyed. And he asked you them, how do you see it now? Is it not as nothing in your eyes? Apparently, it did not have all the gold right? It did not have all the proper prominence that it had previously. Yet now be strong work for I am with you. My spirit remains in your midst, I will fill this house with glory. Now listen, the latter glory of this house shall be greater than the former says, the Lord of hosts. What makes the temple of God truly grand? A what makes the temple of God truly grant is the presence of God. When the glory of God feels his temple, then it is glorious, has nothing to do with the materials that make up the temple. Whether their gold or their copper or whether their iron or wood it makes no difference. It is the glory of God that makes a difference. And the Lord said that the glory of this temple this this building, which does not compare, will nonetheless be greater than the glory of the former temple.

Curtis Byers  38:21
As far as we know, we don't know a lot after that the there is a 40 years of silence between the end of the Old Testament record and the beginning of the New Testament record. And we know that Dearing's receivables days and Azureus days and Haggai Zechariah, that the people repentant and it seems as if they are wholly serving the Lord again in the temple. And so God no doubt accepted their worship, just as he would accept the worship anybody who would do it truly. But then we come to the New Testament, we read of the temple again, but now we call it Herod's temple. And Harris Temple was even more magnificent than Solomon's temple. Not only was the inside, covered with gold, as it was in Solomon's temple, were told I think it was Josephus who tells us and Evan probably can tell me if I'm wrong about this to remind me that the outside of the temple was covered with gold plates. So much so it was you know, it was sad that as you approached Roseland we were blinded by the reflection of the sun off all the gold that encompassed the temple. And not only that, Herod had enlarged the grounds around the temple. Remember, the temple was built upon Mount Moriah. And it was this a high place there within the city of Jerusalem. And the original temple probably had a courtyard around it as well, but because of the on the on the peak of the mountain, it was rather small. Well, that wasn't good enough for Herod Hear building tall walls 80 foot tall and taller around it to make a lot larger space that he filled in to make a larger courtyard. The courtyards I'm told there would be equivalent to like 35 football fields, if that kind of gives you a measure. It was the largest religious complex of the ancient days. The temple wasn't the largest, but the complex because not only was it a temple, there were other buildings inherited built, there was a portico, but the temple grounds the temple complex with a largest in the ancient world. It was a magnificent building. But was God pleased with it? What did Jesus say? He said, You have made it a den of robbers. In fact, that's from our text, right? And you reverse here that back in Jeremiah chapter seven, it kind of comes back full circle. Right? The people are Jesus's day were very much like those in Jeremiah's day. And Jesus said, You have taken this place of God, and you are filling it up with people who are in essence, robbers, thieves. You know, people who do NOT honor GOD, people have no respect for God is become a den of robbers. Let me ask the question again, was the was the temple, the physical temple that Solomon built? Was it a blessing? Or was it a stumbling block? As you ponder that, remember, an earlier incident. When God brought the people into the land of Canaan, the land that he gave him, he ruled them directly he was he was their king. There were judges that he would use to deliver his people from the pressors roundabout, but he was 13. God was her king. And what did the people asked of Samuel to do? They asked for Samuel to a point film, that King. Now, God, no doubt was offended by that and clearly understood that they were they were seeking simply seeking to be like those around the battlefield. But what did God do? God allows them to have a king. God, allow them have a king. You want a king? You can have a king was a god will that they would have a king? No, that wasn't God's will. It was their will. And God concede it was a God's will that there'll be a permanent temple built in Jerusalem? Was that God's will? No. That was Davis will that God conceded? Was the kingship was that a blessing or a curse to the people? The fact that there were kings that become a blessing or a curse to the people? That was a curse. The Lord told them at the time that it was going to be a curse, first of all, your taxes are going to be raised. And that's always a curse. But he's going to have other kind of other kinds of demands, and cycling. If the king goes bad. What does that do with the nation?

Curtis Byers  43:19
The nation goes bad, right? The kingship, I think was a curse to the people of Israel, even though God allowed it to be the cause. And I would always suggest, and I would argue that perhaps the temple also became a curse. Because not because you could not worship God properly there. Yes, you could worship God properly there. But what is proper worship consists of it consists of humble people who are humbly Balan before their God, acknowledging that He is the Creator of all that He is the giver of Every good gift and worshiping Him and serving Him and doing what he says. When people come to the Lord like that it really makes no difference where you are. And surely if they were in the temple that would have been accepted. But the tendency is, right, but the tendency is among us, Hmong people, to put emphasis where God does not put emphasis and to elevate those things that God does not elevate. And I think we have to be careful in that.

Curtis Byers  44:28
So what would probably been the best advice in hindsight that we could have given David, when he asked, Well, can I build the Florida House? It would have been best. I think, if somebody would have simply said, David, the Lord said that he wants to dwell in a tent. Let's just stop there and be content with that. Let's just stop there and be content with that. And I think a lot as we talk about, you know, Bible authority and understanding the scriptures and understanding the will of God. I think sometimes we make it too difficult. If we simply do what God says, stop there, a lot of our problems would never have never happened. If we just stop there, if we just be content, to do what the Lord, ask, and understand that the Lord could have asked it anything, the Lord could have asked us to do anything. So clearly, the things that he has told us to do, are things that he wants us to do. That is his intent, that is his desire. And that is what we should be content with. We're not smart enough to be able to come up and think of something better than what God has already said. David wasn't smart enough. And he was a man after God's own heart, but he wasn't smart enough to come up with something better than what God has said. I don't know. Who knows, we can't rewrite history. Perhaps if the if they had never built a tabernacle, the history of Judah would have been exactly the same, I don't know. And maybe they were simply redirected their allegiance from the house, to a tabernacle. But there's something that's suggestive of a tent of a tabernacle that moves that God can is no longer confined to a place and they didn't understand that they didn't, they thought God was going to protect Jerusalem. In any case, so the horrors to think about, and I would encourage us to ponder that. And I would encourage you to look forward to our study in Jeremiah, I'm looking forward to it. I hope that it'll be a good study for us. There may be some here that I'm having studied God's word. And if you know that there are things in your life that are a mess that you need to repent of, and we would encourage you to do that God has given us this day to make ourselves right with Him. We do not never know we never know if we have another day to do that. So let's take advantage of the day to always do those things that we know that we ought to do to please God, if there's any subject to the invitation. We would encourage you to come at this time, because we stay the same
