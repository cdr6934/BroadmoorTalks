Good morning. Certainly good to see everyone here today, we have a good crowd, and certainly always good. And we can come here and worship our God, you're visiting with us, we want you to know you're our honored guest. We're glad you joined us as we seek to give glory to God and all that we do. So I'm glad you're here. This time, we're going to be studying from God's Word. We have been looking at this year, the theme of raised with Christ raised with Christ. It really is a great theme, and one we need to think on and dwell on quite often. My only apology with with the theme is that I've not really addressed it more than than I have. It is a great theme, and it is one that I'd like to talk about for a few moments this morning. What does it mean to be raised with Christ? And how important is that? I think the Bible has a lot to say about this important subject. And so I think it's worthy of our attention as we consider being raised with Christ. Well, what does it mean? First of all, I think one of the pictures you see when you talk about being raised with Christ is baptism, and you're raised to a new life. Notice in Colossians, chapter two Colossians, chapter two. There was a problem that Colossae and that was, there was a doctrine or a teaching that was going around. And one of the implications that Paul saw saw from that was the the idea that Christ is not sufficient, or Christ is not enough. There seemed to be some that were saying that maybe you needed to have this extra teaching, or you needed to go further in your studies. You needed to have this other knowledge once you learn Christ, Christ is the starting place. But that's not enough. You need something more. I think Paul combats that idea very clearly in the book of Colossians, Christ is sufficient, he is the one that we need, there is no need to go beyond Christ, there is nothing additional needed. Christ is the fullness. And so he says in Colossians, chapter two and verse eight, see to it that no one takes you captive by philosophy and empty deceit, according to human tradition, according to the elemental spirits of the world, and not according to Christ. Do you see his message here, don't be driven by don't follow after this teaching according to human wisdom, rather than Christ. The philosophy that he's talking about is in contrast to Christ in competition with Christ and he sides with Christ. Notice why he does that in verse nine. For in Him in Christ, the whole fullness of deity dwells bodily. That picture of fullness tells us there's nothing else that is needed, the fullness is with Christ, and the fullness of what the fullness of deity dwells with him. We don't know exactly all the teaching that would have been involved with this. Some people may have said that because Jesus had a body that he was sinful or there was something less than in his body, and so we don't see the fullness there. But Paul says the fullness of deity dwells bodily. And notice what we need. He says in verse 10, and you have been filled in Him, who is the head of all rule and authority. Now notice verse 11.

Jeremy Sweets  03:46
In him also, you were circumcised with a circumcision made without hands, by putting off the body of the flesh by the circumcision of Christ, having been buried with him in baptism, in which you also were raised with Him through faith in the powerful working of God, who raised him from the dead. Here he talks about a circumcision in the Old Testament, the Jews would circumcise their children on the eighth day as a sign of the covenant. It was a physical cutting away, that involve the hands of a doctor or something along those lines. But here he says that this circumcision is without hands. It's not a physical circumcision, but it is a putting off of the flesh. It is a putting away of the flesh. This circumcision of Christ can be found in baptism when it says you have been buried with him in baptism, in which you were also raised with Him through faith in the powerful working of God. What does it mean to be raised with Christ? Well, I think baptism pictures, points as to that fuller image of what it means to be raised. With Christ, baptism points us to that. And so he says that you have this circumcision, this sign of the covenant in which you were buried, putting to death, the old man putting off that body of flesh, and you were raised with Him. Notice that putting down and then raised raised up, and we were raised up with Him with Jesus Christ. Later, as we look into chapter three, we're going to see that he talks about the implications of that. Baptism is certainly not the ending point. It's not a rite within itself, that that equal salvation by itself with nothing else further, but rather, it has implications for how one lives. Notice what he says in chapter three and verse one, if then you have been raised with Christ, seek the things that are above where Christ is seated at the right hand of God sets your mind on things that are above not on things that are on the earth, for you have died and your life is hidden with Christ in God. There is an implication for the commitment that comes with baptism for imitating and being drawn into this picture of the life, the death and the resurrection of Jesus Christ. And that implication is that our minds are to be given completely over to God. If you have been raised with Christ, He says, then sets your mind on things above. And he says, Seek the things that are above. There are a lot of things in this life that demand our attention. There are a lot of things that we might be seeking after, but for Christians, at the head of the list, the thing that trumps all else has to be Christ, seek Christ, seek the things that are above where Christ is, he goes on in verse to to say, set your mind on things that are above. When I think of the word setting your mind, I think of cement, if you're the mix, seem it you you get it in

Jeremy Sweets  07:17
a state where you can mix it around before it's hardened before it's set. And so you might put a post into the ground, put some semen in the ground, put that post in there was still able to be moved and put in there. But after a while, that sets, doesn't it. There is stability there. It's not meant to be moved. It's not temporary, it's something that is to be permanent. So what does he say to Christians here, he says, Set your mind, to fix it completely, to put it firmly not in a temporary way, not for one day, one month or even one year. But your mind is to be set on things above what a challenge that is for Christians isn't to have our minds occupied, and to set upon the things that the above instead of the things that are on the earth. Sometimes we get so consumed with the things of the earth. And that's why it's important that we regularly read scripture, pray to God come to meet on a regular basis because we remind ourselves of exactly where our minds should be. And that is sets on the things above. Notice he says in verse three, for you have died and your life is hidden with Christ. Now normally when we say someone has died, we don't then talk about their life. But here he does, for you have die, you have been put to death. But notice he says you still have life and you have life because you have been raised with Christ. Notice verse four, verse four really points us to something else that the Scripture teaches, in a fuller way elsewhere. He says in verse four, when Christ who is your life appears, then you also will appear with Him in glory. And so there is another image of being raised with Christ that I think baptism anticipates looks forward to and that is the very resurrection of Christ. When we are baptized, were raised to walk in newness of life, with our mind fixed on the things above. One day, we will be raised with Christ and the resurrection, and will be raised to eternal life. And so we see the goal here and really this twin dual picture of being raised with Christ. I think these are helpful images for us to think about. Each one of these deserves its own lesson. There's so much to flesh out here and to look at, but it's important for us to understand really why we chose this theme. It's at the heart of what It means to be a Christian. It's at the heart of our hope. It's the reason that we live. So let's notice further. When he talks about being raised with Christ, I think one of the things we noticed is that we are raised in participation with Christ. It's not just that we are raised, we are not raised by ourselves. But it's a beautiful image to see that we are raised with Christ with Christ. We see that first of all, in Colossians, chapter two and verse 11. So many times it says with him, in him, you were also circumcised with a circumcision made without hands, by putting off the body of flesh. And it should be verse 12, Colossians 212, having been buried with Him, in baptism, in which you're also raised with Him, through faith in the powerful working of God, it is in baptism that we participate with Christ, it is not a place where we earn our own salvation or show how great we are, in fact, we are not the point or the emphasis, we are raised with Him, relying upon his work, and what he has done for us. And so that participation with Christ is such a beautiful picture. The Old Testament talks about the beauty of when fellowship comes together when you can rely upon a brother, the beauty of marriage when people participate in a marriage together. But here it even extends beyond those images, to the participation with Christ.

Jeremy Sweets  11:44
Notice he also says in Ephesians, chapter two, verses five and six, there he says, that you were dead in your trespasses and sin in verse one. And in verse four, he says, But God, because of His mercy, His great mercy and His go, loving kindness towards you, but God took action. And what does it say that he did there? It says that he made us alive together with Christ. And He raised us up with Him. And He seeded us with him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus, we participate with cross when we are raised with Him. And then also in Colossians, chapter three and verse three. There it says that your life is hidden with Christ, in God, for you have died and your life is hidden with Christ. The picture is that we have di, we no longer have a life unto ourselves, but rather, our life is with Jesus Christ, and it is hidden with him. It is one with him, it is found in him, I can't help but think about when I try to tell my children to introduce themselves, you know, I'm talking about the the younger ones, and they grab onto your leg, they are going to be one with you, they're going to be hidden with you, they're not going to be separated at all. And here we see that your life has been put to death, and you are hidden in Christ one with him. So when we are raised with Christ, I think that talks about and tells us and points to the participation that we have with Christ. That only makes sense, doesn't it? Jesus Christ is our master, he is the one that we want to be participating with, that we are following after. I'm reminded of the words of Paul in Philippians chapter three, when he says that he has given up all things and counted all things is rubbish, so that he might know the surpassing value of knowing Christ Jesus, so that he might attain to the knowledge of Christ. And he even participates with him. He says in Philippians, three in his sufferings, he's willing to fully identify with Christ, being raised with Christ, I think points to that participation. And so we see the importance of being raised with Christ here. Secondly, I would say that when we are raised with Christ, we need to understand that this is by the power of God. It is God's power, not our own. We are weak, we rely upon God and His power. I think the text makes this point several times in Colossians chapter two and verse 12. You'll notice there that it says that we've been buried with him in baptism, in which you were also raised with Him through faith in the powerful working of God. When we've been baptized, putting to death, that old man of sin and we're raised to walk in newness of of life, do we then pat ourselves on the back? Look what great thing I have accomplished, see what great thing I have done. Now the decision is to be commended. The decision is not an easy one, but the power does not lie in the individual that made the decision. Rather, the power to wash away sins is in God Almighty. And so he says that you have faith in the powerful working of God, who raised him from the dead. Notice that this is the same power that did raise Jesus from the dead. There are a lot of people that display strength today, there are people that can work out non stop, in order to build physical muscles. But that power doesn't compare does it to what God has. Because despite all the power that someone may have, through physically working out, that power fades, that power diminishes. And ultimately, someone's going to die. And then what power will they have? Can someone work out enough in order to raise themselves from the dead clearly not. That's not within our power, but it is within God's. And so the same power that can raise us up is the power that raised Jesus from the dead. This is not a normal, ordinary power. This is not a collective of human strength. There's nothing like that that can compare to this power. For all our learning, have we learned.

Jeremy Sweets  16:44
And we developed enough knowledge, enough strength to be able to raise the dead? Is there any one of us here that expects to live forever on this earth as we are? Now we all know that everyone that has lived, has died. But the power that God has is beyond that. And that's what we need to see and understand and realize it is that power that can raise us up. It is that power that can wash away our sins and wipe away our sin. And so we see it as the very power of God. In first Corinthians six, verse 14, he echoes this thought when he says, And God raised the Lord and will also raise us up by His power. The context of that passage is about using our bodies in a moral way. They're not intended to be used for immorality or sexual immorality. God has plans for our body. And the plans for our body, the purpose of our body, is that it would be raised raised up. We also see in Second Corinthians four in verse 14, there it says, Knowing that He who raised the Lord Jesus will also raise us with Jesus and bring us with you into His presence. They are pointing to the resurrection. At the end of our law, when we die, the question is, will we stay there? Or will we be raised? Paul says, from God's word, that we will be raised. And the power to do that is not our own. But it is God's, it is his power. We also see this in Ephesians, chapter two, in verses four through 10. In the first three verses, it talks about the fact that we are dead on our trespasses and sins, our sin takes us to a place for a point of death. That's where it leads, that's the end result. And so if that were the end of the picture, if God did not act on our behalf, that's where we would stay. But Ephesians two in verse four tells us that God did act, But God, being rich in mercy because of the great love with which He loved us. Even when we were dead in our trespasses, notice the language he made us alive together with Christ, who is doing the acting. It's God isn't. God made us alive together with Christ by grace you have been saved? Who saves us? How are we saved our own works our own righteousness? No, it's by grace by what God is doing for us on our behalf. And it says that He raised us up with Him and seeded us with him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus. Notice that God is doing the acting and each one of those cases, he made us a law. He raised us up with Him. He seated us with him in the heavenly places. That's not an arbitrary decision. It's one that we humbly submit to Him. But it is his power that accomplishes those things. It is God that is working. And this has helped me because there are many that charge in the world that baptism is a matter of works righteousness. If you say that baptism is for salvation, then that is you claiming that you are saving yourself, but the Bible's teaching and the picture here of being raised with Christ is far from that. The emphasis is not on our power, or what we do. We submit to God and humble faith, but based upon that decision, it is God's power that is at work. And we need to see and understand that it's not a matter of fully knowing everything that the Bible has to say, and then our baptism is valid, because I know everything. Do you see that point? The submission is to God in faith of his working power, and he does the work. He saves us Now should we grow in our knowledge? Absolutely. Should we grow in our faith? Absolutely. But that's not the point of salvation. If we can get 100% on the test, it is through humble submission and faith in Christ Jesus, and it is God that makes us alive. It is God that raises this up. It is God that seats us in the heavenly places.

Jeremy Sweets  21:36
There are some people that will say that I could never be a Christian, I could never be that type of person, I could never be good. And that's really a twisted view of the gospel. Because even in that statement, we are focusing on ourselves about what I can do what I can be. But the power lies in God, and what he will do for us through humble faith and submission to His will, it is God's power, that helps me understand at least the picture of baptism, not as a right, that is the end all be all, but as a picture of the life that God wants for us, in Christ Jesus, to be raised with Him. And what a beautiful picture that is. Let me also point out that when we are raised with Christ, we are raised from death to life. And we see that in both pictures, don't we both in baptism, and in the resurrection. In Romans chapter six, Romans chapter six, verses three and four. It says that we have been baptized into Christ Jesus and those of us that have been baptized into Christ Jesus have been baptized and to death. When we are buried in baptism, we are buried into death, whose death, the death of Jesus Christ, we are buried therefore with him by baptism into death, verse four, in order that just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, so we too, might walk in newness of life. Do you see that picture there? We are putting to death ourselves and our sinful man, the one that makes the choices after sin, the one that is committed to selfishness, we put that man to death. And we're raised to walk in newness of life. What is newness of life? And is it found here on this earth? Is it where we dwell upon all the things of this earth in this life? No. It's above. And so we seek the things above we set our mind on the things above where Christ is. And so it is from death to life. And we see that in baptism, we live a new life. We look difference, we act difference, and that is life in Christ. And Ephesians, two verses one and then four and five. He says that you were dead in your sins, but God made us alive. And so we go from death to life. Baptism can take us from death to life. We also see in the resurrection, that that is from a physical death, isn't it to eternal life, and it is life that we find in Jesus and passages and John and the epistles of Paul, we see the teachings of the resurrection, in which we are raised to be with God forevermore. First Corinthians 15 is some people doubted the resurrection, Paul says it's a matter of first importance. It's the basis of our faith. One day, we will be raised and all things will be made right? And we can be with God once again. So we've talked a lot about God and what He has done. But let me ask the question, what should you do? I'll mention that we should ever ask this question without fully comprehending. First what God has done for us, what God has done that has made it possible for us to even choose the path of righteousness, He has given us His Son. And so we see based upon what God has done, we can respond to His goodness, and his kindness. So what should you do? Well, first of all, you should become a Christian, should become a Christian. That means commit your life over to Him, humbly submit to Him, believe that Jesus is the Christ, repent of your sins, turn away from your sins and your selfishness, and give your life completely to Him. You're baptized in the water for the forgiveness of your sins in which you bury the old man and you're raised to walk in newness of life. That is a lifelong commitment that you must honor. It's not a one time event.

Jeremy Sweets  26:14
It is a life time commitment. So what should you do, you should become a Christian? Secondly, you need to depend on God. In order to become a Christian, you're going to have to depend on God. As you live the Christian life, you're going to have to depend on God. And when we die and have no strength in our bones, what are we going to have to do? depend on God, to keep his promise and to raise us up with Him. We must depend on God in all things. We must live a godly life for that honors Jesus Christ, we seek the things above, we seek to do what is right, we seek to give God glory and honor in our life. That is our goal. That's what we are striving for. To live a life of sin is to live contrary to the commitment we've made. It's to live contrary to that newness of life that we're supposed to be walking in. It's to live contrary to what Christ died for. God has prepared good works for us to do. And those that are created in Christ. Jesus needs to follow after that path of a godly life. What should you do? Set your mind on things above? Seek the things that are eternal. Seek the things that are good and right. Maybe you're here this morning and you've not sought the things above? You've been dwelling on yourself. And on the things below, let me commend you and ask you request of you that you would seek the things above. That is the only way to salvation. It's found in God. It's found above. It's not found here. It's not found here. Well, what about this message of the resurrection, I mean, close with one point. It's a lesson we need to learn. I meant to bring this up at the very beginning. But this was my son's Bible class. So he has a little stone here. And he rolls it away, and he sees that he is risen. I love that we're teaching children that it's a message that we can teach our children some message that we need to hear ourselves. Now this is a very simple thing, but it's a powerful message, isn't it? That even our young ones can see and understand he is risen. And that's the same truth that I declared to you today. Jesus Christ rose from the dead. He displayed a power of God that has never been displayed by any human. It only comes from God. If there's anyone here this morning, that subject to the invitation, I'd ask that you come as we stand and sing at this time
