It's good to see you this morning if you have your Bibles, and we're gonna be opening up to Romans chapter 13.

Conrad Harkrider  00:22
Our theme for 2018 here at Broadmoor has been faithful stewards. And stewardship is not really a concept that we think about or talk about a lot. It's not a word that's common in our everyday conversation. But the concept is all around us anytime you are being entrusted with something. Anytime you are given responsibility over something. Anytime someone places something into your care that has some type of value, then you are being entrusted with stewardship. Think about a bus driver. He is a steward over the safety and the well being of the passengers, you may not realize it, but when you step up on those stairs and sit down in your seat, you are entrusting your life to the person behind the wheel. And that's why that first word is so important. We are looking for faithful stewards, we don't just want anyone driving the bus. A person who is blind a person who has never driven before the 10 year old who likes buses. No, we want someone who is trained, who was competent, someone who can handle that task with great care and attention a faithful steward. As we think about our lives, truly there's so much that God has entrusted to each one of us. And this morning, I'd like for us to consider one of the gifts that we've been blessed with. It's not something that you can see, not something that you can hold or touch, you can't buy or sell it. But yet it is a gift that every single person that is living today has been given. And that is the gift of time. It is quite possibly the most valuable resource that we possess in this life. Read with me what Paul says about our life and time in Romans chapter 13, beginning in verse 11. Romans 13 In verse 11, it says and do and do this, knowing the time that now it is high time to awake out of sleep. For now our salvation is nearer than when we first believed. The night is far spent the day is at hand. Therefore, let us cast off the works of darkness, and let us put on the armor of light. Let us walk properly, as in the day not in revelry and drunkenness, not in lewdness and lust not in strife and envy, but put on the Lord Jesus Christ and make no provision for the flesh to fulfill its lust. Paul uses a couple of images here in Romans 13. The first one will notice is in verse 11. He says that it is time to awake out of sleep. Sleep in a scripture or sleep is often is associated with night. And with darkness in the scriptures. Sleep is often used as a term for death. But hear Paul is referring not to death but spiritual drowsiness. People who are living unaware they are without thought or concern they are asleep. But notice the contrast in verse 11, at the beginning of verse 11. He says you know the time you are not asleep you understand the situation. Because God has brought forth the daylight and the morning of his grace and salvation, then that causes us to live in a godly way to live as people who are sober and awake and aware. So first of all, we see that being a faithful steward with our time reminds us that we are to live with awareness. We are to think about how we spend our time how we live our lives. We are to be thoughtful and intentional. We are to live with purpose with a direction with a sense of meaning and belonging. We are to know where we're headed. where we're going in Proverbs chapter seven, when the young man is entrapped by the adulterous woman, do you remember how he is described? It says,

Conrad Harkrider  05:13
In Proverbs seven in verse 22, that he is like an ox headed to the slaughter. Like an animal that is at the butcher shop, no idea what's coming. They eat their food, they drink their water, they mold around in the pin, but there is no consciousness of what is about to take place. I'll never forget, one of the first times I saw a homeless person and actually was aware that that's what they were. We had gone to a baseball game downtown, in the downtown area. And as we were leaving the stadium, there was a man who was asleep on the concrete. And I was with my uncle. And I looked at up at him and I said, Is he dead? He said, No, I think he's just resting or passed out or whatever. But completely unaware of what was going on. around him. I remember thinking as a kid, how can he be asleep, he doesn't have a pillow or a blanket or anything, just totally oblivious to his surroundings. And that's the way many people are today spiritually, giving no thought or concern for the Lord for this life, their content to just lay on the concrete down in the spiritual gutter, and letting time pass by. But Paul says, you know, you have understanding of the time, there should be a distinct contrast in how Christians view their time, their life, their opportunities, and then how those in the world are using their lives. And it starts with being alert, being aware of how we live our lives. Notice the motivation for this in verse 11. He says, For now, our salvation is nearer than when we first believed. To be a good steward of our time, we need to remember that salvation is nearer it's closer now than when we first believed. Think about it. Not just for those who are older, but all of us we are closer today, to meeting the LORD than we were at the beginning of 2018. We're closer to the time when we will stand in judgment than we were at the beginning of last week. Time The time is approaching. And I love the language that's used here. He says that we are closer to salvation, you're closer to the inheritance to the reward to the redemption of your soul. This is not this is intended to be an encouragement to them. You are closer now to the time when you will shed these, these temptations, these trials, these difficulties, the pain that we suffer in this life. We are closer now than when we first came to faith. I asked my wife to marry me on October 25. I had to look back and see what the date was. But I remember it was a it was a Thursday night. We didn't plan to get married until July 5. So that's about eight months time there. And during that window, there was lots of planning that was going on. I didn't get asked to help with much of that. But the sending the invitations and making the arrangements and finding the dress and all of the things that have to go into throwing a big celebration like that. Now, as the day got closer for the wedding, do you think our level and the level of excitement was it increasing? Or was it starting to wane? If you ran into me at the store, and you said Hey, I heard you got engaged. I said yeah, getting married in two months. You might think Do you want to rethink that? The the anticipation note, when you talk to a bride and groom, they say we have 58 days, six hours and seven minutes until we stand together and make our vows. And it's almost like they cannot wait to be together. The day can't come fast enough. Do we long for the day of salvation. Do we want it to be here? Do we anticipate it's coming?

Conrad Harkrider  10:04
Do we think about it like we did when we first came to the Lord, that excitement, that zeal, that passion that we had, when we decided that I am going to follow the Lord, I'm going to submit myself to him. Through baptism, I'm going to have my sins washed away, think about what it was like at the beginning. I think that's what Paul's trying to do here. Take them back to where they were at the first. And that will change how we view and see and use our time. As we think about that our salvation is near. In the book of Acts. After the day of Pentecost, the people were baptized, they accepted the Lord Acts chapter two, verse 44, says that they had all things in common. There was this spirit of, of generosity, they were selling their goods, they were contributing to the needs of one another. They were meeting house to house they were taking their bread with gladness and joy. The Scripture tells us that they were going to the temple and they were praising God. There was this great fervor for the Lord. Paul reminds the Romans to go back to when you first came to Christ, remember what it was like? Because verse 12, when we do that, we reflect on it says the night is far spent, the day is at hand. Therefore let us cast off the works of darkness and let us put on the armor of light. When we remember that our salvation is close that it's near, we'll put off the works of darkness and adorn ourselves with the armor of light. Notice verse 13. He says, Let us walk properly, as in the day not in revelry and drunkenness, not in lewdness and lust not in strife and envy. Being a faithful steward of our time means that we walk properly. The idea of walking when using the Scripture is a metaphor for how we live our life, our conduct, and our behavior, how we spend our time. Do we set our minds and our hearts on heavenly spiritual things? Or are we focused on earthly fleshly physical things Paulist three different couplets here. They come in pairs, a set of two and the first is revelry and drunkenness. The New American Standard says carousing and drunkenness. ESV is orgies. But that that first word carousing has, has to do the idea with excess with letting loose, no restraint. Maybe you think about a Mardi Gras type of celebration or New Year's Eve where people are just not holding back. They're having a good time. Do whatever you want. And it isn't, it isn't amazing that this is written to that almost 2000 years ago, and things are pretty much the same. People are still giving in struggling with drugs, and alcohol. I think what Satan is presenting to the people here, as he has throughout time is if you want to be someone, if you want to have fun, if you want to live life, if you want to really enjoy this world, then this is what you need to be doing. This is what you need to be giving yourself over to. There was a study published recently by the University of Michigan. And they found that liver disease deaths have skyrocketed. Over the past eight years, there's been this huge increase in the number of people that are dying from alcohol related deaths. And they found that the largest increase in terms of percentage was among people who are 25 to 34 years old, young people. So often we think when we're young that this this is I'm having a good time, it's not going to affect me things are going good. I'm just hanging out with my friends. But there is a reason why God warns against these things. It is walking in darkness not only the devastating physical effects, but what is it doing to our hearts and our minds. The next pair that's mentioned says lewdness and lust. It's also translated as sexual immorality and sensuality. Are we walking properly? Or do we find ourselves just being driven and pulled along by our desires and Euless? Few years ago,

Conrad Harkrider  14:56
I had an opportunity to be a counselor summer camp. Maybe some of you You got to enjoy one of those in the past few months. But one of the things they did is they have the whole day blocked out from 7am to 9pm. It's like you're on a schedule, and they have sports and activities and games and food and DeBose. And it's just the whole day. But in the afternoon, there was one block of time. They had it there on the schedule just said free time. And that meant that you can pretty much do whatever you want it you couldn't leave the campsite or break the rules or anything, but you are free to choose what you wanted to do. You know, in this country, we have a lot of free time. There's opportunities where we're between work and and family life. The kids have gone to bed, we're on summer break. We get to choose what we do with those hours with those minutes. And the question is, how are we spending that free time? What are we doing with it? Are we using it to indulge in our passions, our desires, our lusts? Are we giving ourselves over to what Paul says here to sensuality? When we do that, it's no longer free time because we have become enslaved to our desires. We have given ourselves up and we are no longer walking properly. The last pair here in verse 13 says strife and envy. The ESV says quarreling and jealousy bickering disagreements, arguing in Proverbs chapter 16. And verse 28. It says a dishonest man spreads strife and a whisper separates close friends. Mark used a good illustration this morning in our our Bible class about a person who takes information and shares it with others trying to put a wedge in between relationships. These are little morsels these people always seem to know the happenings of what's going on in the lives of others. And then they take those and drop them into a conversation almost for shock or for laughter or surprise to get a reaction from people. They thrive at the expense of others constantly tearing down. And they wouldn't tell you this. But often, the motivation for sharing that type of information is jealousy. It's being jealous of something that someone else has I'm unhappy with my life, I'm envious of someone else. And so I tear down the list that Paul gives here drinking sex and fighting. It's like a typical Friday night for many people in the world. But not so with Christians, we have come out of the darkness we adorn ourselves with that armor of light. And we are to walk properly spending our time walking wisely. The standard for our walk is given in verse 14. He says But put on the Lord Jesus Christ and make no provision for the flesh to fulfill its lust we are to put on the Lord. We are to dress ourselves with the Lord to wear the armor of light to clothe ourselves with Jesus Christ. You remember in the Old Testament and Exodus, chapter 28, it talks about the garments that the priests would wear. And if you've ever read through that it goes into these minut details about the types of thread that were used. gold and red and Scarlet and purple, and this fine linen that they wore and they had these precious stones that were engraved and fixed to the outside. on their head. They wore a turban with a gold plate and inscribed on that. It said holy to the Lord. Everything about their dress was to signify the special role in the position that they held.

Conrad Harkrider  19:34
In a similar way Christians are to be adorned with special attire. We are to dress ourselves with something that is purposeful and specific. When you're getting dressed in the mornings, it's not just the shirt that you put on the dress that you're wearing. It's not the way that your hair looks. But do you think about am I adorning myself With the Lord Jesus Christ, that is, have I put on the character and the heart of the Savior? Am I imitating his compassion? Do I follow his attitude of obedience? Do I share his love for other people, both brothers in Christ and those who are outside of the body? Do I think about? How would the Lord feel about the way I use my time, my thoughts, my actions, my attitudes, would this honor the Lord. In Romans chapter 14 And verse eight, it says, For if we live, we live to the Lord. And if we die, we die to the Lord. So then whether we live or whether we die, we are the Lord's put on the Lord Jesus Christ. Being a faithful steward with our time also means that we make no provisions for the flesh. The NIV says, Do not think about how to gratify the desires of the flesh making provision that involves some type of preparation, there is a planning, there's a arranging setting things in order, we make provisions for a camping trip where we're setting things aside so that we have access to them so that we can use them, making them available. You think about if you go on a diet, one of the first things that you have to do when you're trying to eat differently, is you got to clean out the pantry. You got to remove the foods that you no longer want to be around want to eat, want to touch. It's, if I went to the grocery store, and I saw the the half gallon ice cream, and I said, You know what, I'm just I'm going to put that in the freezer at the house not to eat it. But just when I finished my diet, then then it'll be there waiting for me. That's, that's foolish thinking that's ridiculous. Because we're setting ourselves up. We're placing a snare or a trap in our path. And we're making provisions for the flesh. How often do we plan for or allow sin to stay in our lives. That computer gives us problems, but yet we continue to use it in situations that are going to be harmful. We spend time with people that are bad influences. And yet we continue to keep close relationships. We put ourselves in situations where it's difficult to say no. Paul says to make no provision for the flesh. So often we place ourselves in the middle of temptation, and then we hope that we're going to be strong enough to resist it. But instead, we're setting ourselves up for failure. Ephesians chapter four and verse 27, says, Do not give the devil an opportunity. You ever been around a salesperson and you just don't give them an opportunity? You know, sometimes that's just you just hang up, you turn around, you walk away, you go in a different direction. And that's what we have to do with temptation. Don't give it ground, don't allow it to have a footing in your heart. Don't give provision for the flesh. I want to close this morning, with just a few thoughts about priorities.

Conrad Harkrider  23:46
Paul addresses some of the negative things that we can use our time for. I want to think for just a few moments about the priorities that we place in our life. This is something that Jesus had perfect balance in. He knew his priorities. He knew why he had come to this earth. He knew what his purpose was to do the Father's will. And he was able to balance the needs of his disciples and of those who are lost and the people around him and his own personal needs. And to do that perfectly, because I believe he had ordered his priorities. If we were to come up with a list this morning of your top four priorities, the four most important things in your life, what would they be? Family, your faith, your friends, your health, your career, take your house, something along those lines. But for things that are most important to you, I want you to think if you had to order those from one to four in the list of most important to least important, where would they fall? I think the fact that you're here this morning, that you're taking time out of your week out of your schedule out of your life to come and worship God, I think that shows that you care about the Lord. So I believe most of us will be putting Number One On The List will be our faith. Then next would come to relationships, the people that are most important to us, our family or our friends, and then down the list career, or some other responsibility or obligation that we might have. Now want you to think about if you had to put the number of hours per week that you spend on each of those responsibilities. For most of us that if you have a full time job 40 hours a week for, for some it's 50 to 60 hours because of the the requirements of the job, you start to put the hours next to those priorities. And it's not mutually exclusive by being a diligent and honest worker, that's part of our service to God. But how much time are we spending with our family? How much time are we giving to our friends, our relationships, the people that are important to us. You see, we often talk about what's most important, but then when we look at how we spend our time, how we're using the time, the gift of time that God has given, oftentimes, those things, they don't align the amount of interest and effort that we put into something. We don't say that, you know, the most important thing to me in my life is watching TV. The most important thing to me, is being on my phone. But often where we spend our time that does show where our priorities are, where our interests where they lie. Jesus said that where your treasure is there, your heart will be also over the next few weeks, many of you are going to be starting classes in school, you're going to be going back into a regular routine, where you have to do homework and do assignments and projects and there's going to be a lot of busyness. But don't forget, don't neglect the most important aspect of who you are. Don't set aside the most important that the greatest priority that you have in your life, the relationship that you have with your Father in heaven. The reality is, is that our time here on this earth is limited. None of us know how much more time we're going to be given. And the scriptures say that our life is like a flower that appears for just a short time and then eventually will will vanish away. When you stand and look at a tombstone. It kind of as a brief summary of a person's life when they were born, the date they died, and then their name.

Conrad Harkrider  28:23
But what matters most in this world is not where you were born, or where you die, or even how much time you live. But how are you using those opportunities? How are we using the gift of time that the Lord has given to us and as we read in our scripture reading one day we will stand before the Lord, as the servants did who received the talents and we will give an account for how we've spent our years are we being faithful stewards of this precious gift that God has given to us. We're going to close with a song to encourage those who are here if there's something that we can do to help you in your walk with Christ. If you need to respond to the Lord's invitation, please come down to the front as we stand and sing
