Good evening. It's good to be with you all tonight. I really appreciate the invitation to be here. I think of all of the congregations that I've been around since I moved to Dixon about five years ago. This congregation at Broadmoor is composed of the most people that I have known for the longest amount of time. I don't know how that will go for the lesson tonight. But and also, the more dangerously, this is the congregation that has the most kids that my kids know. So if at any point in the lesson, it looks like I am just giving you a stink eye, you probably have one of my kids behind your shoulder. And I'm just trying to get it under control. We're in Second Samuel chapter six tonight, if you'll turn in your Bibles there, perhaps put your ribbons there. We'll be going between there and First Chronicles 15 For some, some comparisons, but we'll spend the balance of the time most of it in Second Samuel. Let me start by asking a question. How good are you at being corrected? Can you take it with grace? Do you? Would you say you keep your emotions in check? It's one thing to say yeah, on the front end, but it often becomes an entirely different matter altogether when somebody acts on that claim that you can handle it. I've talked to quite a few other preachers over the years, and I am not the only one that gets thin skinned, you might say about criticism, you know, you may be thanked 50 times for a good lesson. But then the one that you can't get out of your mind is the one person who had something that they wanted to correct about it. That's what sticks with you. And what's worse than that, because that's really kind of a piddly example, but being wrong, and somebody gets hurt by it. Maybe it's some like a safety matter with your kids. You're saying He's fine. He can handle it. He doesn't need a helmet. You know, and then you've got an ER bill and a new house rule. Do you know what I feel when one of my children suddenly gets hurt because they were, you know, balancing on something and I was just watching them do it or they go by too fast. I didn't say anything. When I feel anger. Anger right there with the adrenaline rush, I feel a rush of anger at the child at the situation. At my own shame. My first impulsive feeling in a split second is I want to rush up to them and say why do you have to go mess it up like that? It's hard not to be defensive.

Mitch Stevens  02:51
On a different note, when somebody at church pulls you aside, it takes a lot for you to stop and admit if when you reach that point, and the point is a valid one that you had been religiously wrong, and admitting that is only going to come if you cleared a step prior to that, in that you were seeing your error, your ability to see your error. Defensiveness, even anger is a normal reaction. I mean, just look around you people are losing their minds all over the place. Whenever somebody dares to disagree with them. Well, it is a normal reaction. But it is not a righteous action. To be a Christian. You've got to be open to correction. How do you get to the point of being a disciple without that right? And it's something that not just goes between you and the Lord, but it's something that fits your disposition as a child of God, a growing disciple of Jesus Christ, we need to accept criticism from the outset with humility, and love and gratitude. So we can objectively weigh it against the truth and not against our field SOS and are always halves. As a person, I may feel bad, you know, if if you show me that I'm caught up in some error. But as a believer, I am called to push that aside and say, You are a true friend to me if you will show me how I am caught up in some false way. King David was a man after God's own heart, out of God's own mouth. He said it in so many words in First Samuel chapter 13, in verse 14, a man chosen by God for how he would do God's will. That's how God said it he's a man after My heart who will do My will But in the course of studying his life, you've got to conclude that that does not mean that he was a sinless man. The quality that David shows us when you do go through his life is time and again, besides, you might also put his bold initiative of faith in there. But what you also see is his ability to repent, well, he was spiritually resilient. Here was a man who did not always follow the directions the first time given, but he knew how to stand corrected. So in Second Samuel chapter six, King David is in the midst of taking a huge step, just in the in the plan of the story of the Old Testament for the kingdom. He has secured Israel's land, he has expanded its borders, he has set its neighboring rivals to tribute. And he has established kingship over all of the tribes and established a new capital city, Jerusalem, that kind of like our Washington DC is not in any established area, it's kind of in Benjamin, which is good, because the prior King was there. But it's a newly conquered territory, new turf, and now he is doing what an Israelite King ought to be doing. He is bringing worship, into his center of kingship into the presence into His presence, God's presence is going into the city, so that now the shining thing is not his throne, his throne is established in service to the presence of God. And he's doing that by moving the Ark of the Covenant up to Mount Zion, the place where God is going to consolidate his worship, as he told them to expect through his prophet Moses, the Ark of the Covenant represented God's presence among his people, many times just in shorthand language, it's spoken that of that way that God's presence spoke forth from the ark. In the time of the judge, Eli, the Ark of the Covenant was kept at the tabernacle in Shiloh. And at that time, Israel was at war with the Philistines, and they were losing. So they realized that this meant God was not with them in battle. That's correct. But then the Israelites decided that they would take God with them into the next battle by bringing the Ark of the Covenant out with them. Like like that would provoke God's favor, they figured, but of course, you know, God wasn't with them in the prior battle, not because they have forgotten to swing by and pick him up. He wasn't with them, because their hearts were not with him. Their leaders were not with him. They were corrupt. The priests were fowl caught up in idolatry, immorality. So the next battle also was a slaughter the Philistines killed 30,000 men. It's another number that's going to pop up in our reading tonight, and they captured the ark. Now think of what an insult that is to the Israelites from God. It's essentially God saying You are being so wicked. And so misunderstanding with this, that I might as well let them have it. They didn't know how to handle being in God's presence. And what that slaughter should have taught them again, was that when the Ark is mishandled, people die. The presence of God is holy, and dangerously. So. Of course, God didn't let the Philistines you know, just take this symbol of his presence without them teaching them a lesson about fearing the one true God. They had a miserable time with it. It's a comic, a comic thing for us to read everywhere it was taken, their gods were desecrated, plagues followed, they finally just had enough of it. That's not the way in their thinking. It goes when one Near Eastern people and their god captures another people's God. That's the kind of thing they're supposed to brag about in their documents. Look, we bested them. But this, this God of the Israelites was just just completely destroying them. They finally had enough of it. Let's get rid of this thing before it kills all of us. So they devised a way to send the Ark back to Israel. They loaded it onto a cart hitched to two nursing cows who by nature would not want to stray very far from their calves. So they point the cows out and it is clear when the mothers begin walking away from their nursing babies, that it is God who is directing that cart and off it goes to Israelite territory. The Philistines sent the Ark back, just take it please. And the people of Beth Shemesh We're excited to have it they through a big worship service, they decided that they also wanted to have people go and look inside of it.

Mitch Stevens  10:07
Now, keep in mind when Joshua was marching with this, he kept people 1000 yards back. And that was when it was covered. So the numbers of what happened next are difficult to reconcile. But the text says literally 70 Men, 50,000 men were struck by a great slaughter. When the ark was mishandled, people died. So Beth Shemesh says take it, please. And the Ark is taken to carry jerem and was kept in the house of Abinadab for 20 years, also called the city is also called bail Judah in our reading, probably for a good reason you're curious. Jereme is a a nice renaming of a pagan name. It's like Woodsville carry, whereas bale Judah is just what it sounds like bale of Judah, David is taking it from this place bale to this new place. So that's probably symbolic. But now that's that's where they're going. It has been in Kiriath jerem, Baal Judah for 20 years, and then it stayed there undisturbed through the reign of Saul and David is leading the procession to carry jerem, about seven and a half miles northwest of Jerusalem, to bring the ark to the new capital. And he's leading 30,000 Choice man of Israel, there's our number again. He's backed up by the full support of the of the people it gets. You took an intertribal poll and got unanimous support, lots of enthusiasm. And finally, things are being set, right? They went, they loaded up the Ark onto a new ox cart. And they're ready to bring it back home with great fanfare. So let's begin reading in Second Samuel six, beginning in verse three. They placed the ark of God on a new cart, that they might bring it from the house of Abinadab, which was on the Hill, and Uzza. And Ohio the sons of of Ben adab, were leading the new cart. So they brought it with the ark of God from the house of Abinadab, which was on the Hill, and Ohio was walking ahead of the ark. Meanwhile, David and all the houses of Israel were celebrating before the Lord with all kinds of instruments made of firm wood, and with liars, hearts, tambourines cast nets and symbols. But when they came to the threshing floor of Nagin, as a reached out toward the ark of God and took hold of it, for the oxen nearly upset it, and the anger of the Lord burned against us. And God struck him down there for his irreverence. And he died there by the ark of God. David became angry because of the Lord's outburst against us. And that place is called Perez as a to this day, breaking out against Uzza. So David was afraid of the Lord that day and he said, how can the ark of the Lord come to me, and David was unwilling to move the ark of the Lord into the city of David with him but David took it aside to the house of Obed Edom to get tight. Thus the ark of the Lord remained in the house of Obed Edom to get tight three months, and the Lord blessed Obed Edom, and all his household. Well, now this is frustrating. Is God in favor of having the Ark moved? You come to verse 11. And apparently so. And then verse 12. Now it was told King David after this three month period, the Lord has blessed the house of Obed, Edom and all that belongs to him, on account of the ark of God. Now you remember how badly it went for the Philistines? It was quite obvious that the Ark is running things where it is so appear here. Apparently, the blessings are so obvious, it's something to report this is God's approval is shining, on the place where the Ark is. So he approves the overall action going to Jerusalem, and everybody involved approved of the overall action, take it to Jerusalem, and everybody involved is excited. And there's religious fervor. And then one misstep, stops the whole procession dead in its tracks. Uzziah in his case, literally was dead in his tracks. So what went wrong? As God gave specific directions for how the ark was to be built, he also gave directions for how the ark was to be handled, moved, it was not to be touched.

Mitch Stevens  14:59
Now in this To lead David was angry at God for how it just fell apart at naked were Saul had once confronted a similar situation what what you might call Keynes dilemma. Now it falls on David. Here's what I mean by Keynes dilemma you remember this, the offerings of the sons of Adam and Eve and one is pleasing April's and one is not. And the offering of each person is caught up within their personalities. God's favor was not for Cain. His response to God rejecting what he was doing, though, was anger. And the Lord said to Cain, why are you so angry? And why is your countenance fallen? If you do well, will not your countenance be lifted up? And if you do not do well, sin is crouching at the door, and its desire is for you. But you must master yet? How will you stand corrected? Here is the crossroads. What are you going to do with this feeling? Is it a legitimate thing? Or are you legitimately wrong and need to come in to conformity with God's will and God's person? This whole incident with David shakes his resolve, and it makes him doubt the whole enterprise. But in that three months, again, the ark, bless the house of Obed Edom. And David correctly interprets the problem is not in moving the ark. It's in how we removing the ark. And here's the lesson for him and the lesson for us, it matters how you carry out a god approved goal, something that you want and something that you know God wants. Glorifying God is a matter of right means, as well as write intention, and write objective. This is a major sticking point. In our play. I don't know if it's ever not been a sticking point, we're reading a story. We're here. It's even a sticking point with David. But it's a sticking point in our time for people who have been raised on consumerist religion, where what is done is determined by the will of the people being served. Or it's a problem for people who are brought up among folks who worship God in all sincerity, but with the wrong kind of leadership, or the wrong focus on ministry, or the wrong form of worship. All of that matters. But lots of people don't see in our day why it should. So let's let's take a moment to test out some common defenses for wrong religious practices from our day, like praise bands with their rock style performances. Solo mega pastors, female leadership, pray this prayer salvation plans, assemblies that have more to do with glow in the dark volleyball than with communion. So let's just take a few of the common rationales for things like that, and go back to David's 30,000 Strong mega service. And let's make a defense for that OXCART. Think of all the good reasons why the people involved well intentioned and doing something that God clearly wants them to do in some way, good reasons for why they might have had for doing it the way they did. Well, it is a more formal way to do it. I mean, if you think about it, one way carrying the Ark is just so pre wheel. The Ark is a cherished relic at this point. 400 500 years old by this time, times have changed. This is a special occasion, or royal occasion. It calls for special innovation, a new ox cart would have been more sophisticated.

Mitch Stevens  19:06
Or second. Others used an ox cart with no problem. It got the job done. I think really this is it. I think this one is why they did it the way they did it. Because think about it. How did the Israelites get that ark back into their possession in the first place? The Philistines put a lot of thought into this. After all that grief that they had suffered. If you want to go back and look at First Samuel chapter six, here's verse two, the Philistines called for the priests and the diviner saying, What shall we do with the ark of the Lord? Tell us how we shall send it to its place. So they're getting all their religious experts together and the religious experts conclude now therefore taking prepare a new cart and to milk cows on which there has never been a yoke and hitch the cows to the cart and take their calves home away from them. So we've got that this Dory, commencing and on that occasion, God had acknowledged the ark. While it was on the ox cart, he led that cart, and nobody got hurt. The cows were fine, the oxen were fine. Things worked. Alright. So there's that. But then another thing, God's Word does not say, not to use an oxcart. Look for it anywhere in the penance hook that it talks about the ark, you won't find a single mention about ox carts, there's no ox cart clause. What does it say? Well, you start going down the road of what the Bible doesn't say. And you very quickly begin compiling a list of what the Bible does say. That is, when that sinking feeling starts to set in, like it did for David, you start looking at what it does say and you begin seeing certain things occurring, a pattern, if you will, of what's there, what's not there. You know, that moment where options that you'd never considered before begin occurring to you. And you go from feeling completely justified to being just plain uncomfortable. That's David's journey. What had God said, about moving the ark? What thought about its transport had gone into its design are quite a bit and very apparent. Exodus chapter 25, verse 12, you shall cast four gold rings for it, and fasten them on it's four feet, and two rings shall be on one side of it, and two rings on the other side of it. And you shall make poles of acacia wood, and overlay them with gold. And you shall put the poles into the rings on the sides of the ark to carry the ark with them. The Poles shall remain in the rings of the ark, they shall not be removed from it. God had even specified a certain family within the tribe of Levi, the CO fights, there's a couple of them to carry the ark and the other holy objects have given some time to think about it. David comes up with a new plan. And you read a lot more about it. Over in First Chronicles First Chronicles chapter 15. A lot more detail in that chapter where David is calling things out he calls roll he identifies the people, he gives his reasons. Now there is there is a specific reason why. First Chronicles includes more detail than First Samuel does. First Samuel is written to people who were in exile, and wondering, how did we get here? First Chronicles is written to people who have gotten back from the exile in our rebuilding. And their question is, what are we supposed to do from here? So this text is going to emphasize a lot more the order of things, the positive construction of things, what was good about what was before that should be carried on in their time for Samuel is more like, here's everything that we did wrong. And that's how it led us to this situation. Well, here's what David says, First Chronicles 15 to David said, No one is to carry the ark of God, but the Levites for the Lord chose them to carry the ark of God and to minister to him forever. Like I said, a lot of detail, a lot of naming and identifying and chronologies. Verse 13, he says, Because you Levites did not carry it at the first, the Lord our God made an outburst on us for we did not seek Him. According to the ordinance, that's the New American Standard or we did not give it the proper care is how the New Revised Standard Version puts it. I like that we did not give it the proper care.

Mitch Stevens  24:00
So the priests and the Levites consecrated themselves not right just to have the right people, the right blood, the right names on the page, those people had to be ceremonially ready to engage in this worship. So they're prepared to bring up the ark of the Lord God of Israel, and the sons of the Levites carried the ark of God on their shoulders, with the poles they're on as Moses had commanded, according to the Word of the Lord. Now, the next thing he does in First Chronicles is appoint the proper leaders of worship. This this whole section about musicians and singers from the clans of the Levites. So the musical praise the second time around and chronicles really brings this out is restricted to the Levites. At least the leadership of such says everybody's involved in the scene, but the leading here of this is the Levites. So apparently We all have those liars and harps and tambourines and casting nets and symbols that we read about in the first attempt had been this big, disorganized jam session. Disorderly rather than holy music as worship has always been very specifically managed by God, the people who liked to reach back into the Old Testament and try to pull instrumental music forward, because the New Testament specifically only says sing. So they got to go back for the instruments of the Old Testament, but when they pull them forward, they would not like the kind of playing that is actually there. From the best I can tell. It's more like a bugler signaling orders, or a drummers beating the cadence than it was a Steven Curtis Chapman concert. It apparently mattered though to God, how things were being done. He took it seriously. He had given the proper order and because he had given order, it made a difference. Now, does that seem silly to us? Because it seems silly to our neighbors. No. Why? Why does it matter how you get arc x from point A to point B, so long as it gets there? We've established I want to do it. God wants it done. I'll tell you it matters because God is in the process. He is both presenting himself. And he is shaping us within those details. There is a proper way and there is an improper way. That's what proper ways end up doing. It renders everything else is improper. He had revealed the way he wanted it done. The people were all stirred up. They were having a big God stock concert, a big show of unity, a march to the Capitol. Everybody is breaking out. That's language of modern worship as well. Isn't it just break out calling on God to break out come down? Just Just wash your people in your presence calling on God to break out move among your people? Will? Did God break out here? Yeah, the place is called Perez as a the breaking out on us. From that day forth, what we forget is sometimes when God moves, it is for judgment, or it cuts that way if we're standing in wrong disposition toward him. But you know, getting back to our reasons, and OXCART is just a better way. Let's just think it's easier, it's the best way to use a word that we might be familiar with. It is the most expedient way to reach the end. Actually, you can't use that that's not true. Because to be expedient, something has to fit within the parameters of the objective. It has to fit with the specifics of God's authorization. But this does get used all this is expedient is the best way. There are a lot of things that get labeled expedient today that are actually entirely unscriptural. There's no Bible authority for them. In other words, doesn't fit what we know, either than the objectives or in the specifics. The problem with the OXCART was that it was David's way, or it was the Philistines way. It was the way of the people it was the way of the history or even you could say the tradition, but it conflicted with God's pattern.

Mitch Stevens  28:57
Tell you what, if we could manage to come up with 10 solid reasons given our culture, doing a demographic study going over the latest consumer polls, success stories of other groups, consult all the Lifeway materials, at least 10 reasons why a new religious method would work better for this congregation, it still wouldn't matter if we did not first consult with the Lord. God has never said anything about oxcarts at their time. So how did David figure out what God did want? Well, that's that's kind of a bigger question. How do you discern the will of the Lord? Well, that was settled very early on when Moses was addressing the newly formed nation of Israel Deuteronomy four verse two, you shall not add to the word which I am commanding you, nor take away from it. You may keep the commandments of the Lord your God, which I commanded you. So once David got his, got himself back on track, it was easy to do. I don't think all three months were just in intensive research. Here's what it says. Let's do that next time. There are similar passages in our law books, like Colossians, three, verse 17, whatever you do, in word or deed, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks through him to God, the Father, that's not saying Take whatever you want to do and baptize it, stick a Jesus label on it to act in the name of is clear enough, it's really as a concept for us, we get it when it comes to identity theft, don't we? If someone takes your name, what have they done, they've taken your executive power they've taken and they're gonna take you for all you're worth. And then they're gonna keep on going. We understand the authority of a name in other places. First Peter four, verse 11, is another instance, first part of the verse says, Whoever speaks, let him speak as it were, the utterances of God. This is one of those verses that we know so well, that we might have to stop and maybe read it with different points of emphasis, the utterances of God, just taking a little bit of the heat that comes off of the Ark of the Covenant from the bit of review that we've done about that, think about that. Putting those words, just everything you know, in the Bible about the majesty of God, put it on that his all power is all knowing he is everlasting. We can't presume to call the shots, least of all, in matters of worship, which is about God directing us to praise Him. Let the worshipper decide, really the form of worship, that is most enriching for us, for God to do that is like letting the patient decide what the best medicine should be. You don't want to put me in charge of passing out the meds, I would be like, well, here, these pills match your eyes. And your baby is little so they can have these little pills. These match your initials. So there you go. To engage the presence of God, though, is to deal in matters of life and death. Romans chapter 11, verse 34, For who has known the mind of the Lord, or who has been his counselor, it's versus illusions like this, that teach us that on religious matters, it isn't important, what you think. What matters is what God's Word says. It's like the question that Jesus put to John the Baptist critics Was the baptism of John from heaven, or was it for men? That question cuts to the heart of not just the matter, I mean, he it's he sticks it to the critics who are going after John in that time for why they were doing it, but it cuts to the heart of the issue in general, because, like those Jewish authorities, a lot of times people reject the Scripture away, not because it's not clearly what the New Testament says, when you go through and look and see. It's because they don't want to change. But if you don't know the Bible, and you don't know the mind of God, and you're not going to get this concept that when he speaks, we need to listen.

Mitch Stevens  33:54
But here, we have to consider one final objection. And I think it's really a pretty big one, considering the current state of things. Regarding Uzza. And getting back into how the story did go at that point. I mean, at the point where the ox or they misstepped what does God expect to be done? The ark was already on the ox cart, Okay, oops, mistake made. The oxen had stumbled. The damage is about to be done. Say you're having an authority discussion with somebody on the principle of Bible authority, and they're persuaded to the point that they are troubled. You've shown them about the church and about its worship and about its leadership and about the doctrine of salvation and they say, on whatever point you've been discussing, what do you expect us to do at this point? I mean, sure, I yeah, I agree with you. It's a fine discussion to have, you know, hypothet adequately. But now we've got all these programs. We got all this infrastructure, we've got all these institutions. We got all these years of tradition, beloved generations gone past, it's our responsibility. We built it. So like I said, it's easy to relate to King David situation, the ark was already on the OXCART. It was a done deal. They put the Ark up on this thing, and then the oxen stumble, and then what? What would God have them do? What is the right answer at this point? Shall I suggest a real possibility? Given what happened to Uzza? Let it fall. What do you expect? Now, I admit, that's difficult, but let it fall. That is to say, trust God, to take care of it. And they've got enough background, he gave the fake gave it to the Philistines, and he took it back without a bit of help from a single breathing human being. Worst case, If God lets it hit the ground, then you gather some coal with lights to come and pick it up. The natural thing is to preserve the status quo as wrong or as complicated as we might be proven, and shown that it might be. But the faithful thing from that point is to actually let it go. anticipate it's going to hurt to do so. But having a faith in the right way to trust that after some painful readjusting. It's going to be better. This applies to so many things today, from Bible authority onward. If it isn't fundamentally authorized, then drop it. Let it fall. What happens in the second half of the chapter, I'm going to simply give it to you as an epilogue. Verse 13, so it was that when the bearers of the ark of the Lord had gone six paces, he sacrificed an ox and a fat like, I think that's entirely meaningful. And you can imagine those steps. The seven step, the Sabbath step, they stop and they have a Sabbath of steps. Okay? God is blessing this. He's letting us move it this way is approved. That's what we get. And David was dancing before the Lord. I was diversity. And yeah, David was dancing before the Lord, verse 14, with all his might. And David was wearing a linen ephod, to priests garment. So David and all the house of Israel were bringing up the ark of the Lord was shouting and the sound of the trumpet. Here's an important question that may weigh in on the nature of David's heart before God, how to stand corrected after being corrected. And yes, after growing despondent, taking a break, going back and following the proper form. Here's my question. Did that kill David's enthusiasm? Did that just take everything out of the worship?

Mitch Stevens  38:27
Not a bit. Right worship is structured, but it must not be heartless. It's just a matter of shaping our enthusiasms to follow what God presents to us. Right worship must be truthful, and it must be spirited. I will sing with the spirit and I will sing with the mind, also mind and spirit. This whole thing was not a matter of professional pride for David this move. Yeah, it was good for his kingship that he's moving the art to the Capitol. But it was not some cynical, calculated political performance. He's not sitting there waiting for the papers to show up before he takes his first steps with the ark. He's dressed for worship, in a garment similar to those that the Levites are wearing. And again, Chronicles brings this out even clearer. He wasn't dressed like the king. He wasn't acting like the king. This is not some matter of state. It reads more like he's acting like some kid who's running up to the house right ahead of grandma and grandpa when they've come for a visit. You know that walk right? Like, come on. I am going to show you every one of my toys, and on ahead. They're just they're just excited that you're there. Verse 16. Then it happened as the ark of the Lord came into the city of David, that Michael the daughter of Saul looked out of the window and saw King David leaping in dancing before the Lord and she despised him in her heart. Now there's a lot of baggage complexity, you might say, In what follows. The conflict with Michael is in the story for one main purpose and that is laid out at the end of the chapter. If you go to verse 23. Michael, the daughter of Saul had no child to the day of her death. Did you see that? Michael three times is called daughter of Saul, not wife of David. See, it confirms that the line of Sol is not going to be a part of the Davidic dynasty. That's why it's in there. But this mention that Michael looked out of the window. That's also evocative. It calls back to mind. The last time we saw her in person, which is when she was watching David through a window when he's fleeing for his life from Saul. Now back then it says Michael loved David. It never says David loved Michael. Her brother Jonathan was his dearest friend in the whole wide world. When David left him it says they kissed one another and wept with one another David weeping the most. Meanwhile, one chapter before he had said goodbye to Michael by saying let me go Why should I kill you here hold this rope. After David's departure, David forced Saul rather forced Michael to marry another man Powell tayo, a Benjamin Ike kinsmen, and that marriage seemed to have been forced on her. But it turns out that demand treated her well. After Saul's death, David returns and he says, Bring Michael Saul's daughter, not bring my wife bring Saul's daughter. And it says in Second Samuel three and ishbosheth sent and took her from her husband pow tile the son of leash, but her husband went with her weeping after her all the way to be here. And then Abner said to him go return, like throwing rocks at a golden retriever, who won't stop following you out of the driveway. And he returned. The last time we see her is here, when she looks upon David as He is dancing joyously before the Ark of the Covenant as it is brought into Jerusalem. And she is seeing once again, a passion being expressed by David for something that he cherished. And it was a passion unlike anything we ever see him expressing for her. Now it might be worth it. To look at this scene, and see a man dedicated to right worship and scriptural form. But pause our authority sermon to see that as much as he cared about right worship and scriptural form. He has a bitter wife at home who holds him in contempt. And take note of that. Like all fights between married people, this is complicated.

Mitch Stevens  43:31
But on the surface, she's wrong. In her bitterness, she is wrong. In her bitterness, she is a daughter of Saul, she is father's daughter. She does not get all this fuss being given to attending to the ark. All that matters to her is keeping up the appearances of the kingship. And that's where David is presented commendably. He's not worried about appearances. He's passionate about God. So in this aspect of the story, Michael is like the person who walks away from a worship assembly and says, the preachers tie was crooked the whole time. And the song leader pitch the songs too high.

Mitch Stevens  44:24
But I want to ask that person, name me to songs that we sang. And just give me one point that the preacher made from a text. Many of us have a tendency to judge the validity of a particular worship by how much we have enjoyed it by how much it takes us out of the mood that we brought in with us. Look, you have imperfect men, with imperfect family lives leading imperfect worship, while leading worship correctly but imperfectly. Are you going to despise the church, and its worship because of that? Michael says, the servant girls must have liked watching you kick around in that little robe. And David says, Those girls and I were trying to worship. And while you sit there criticizing we are the better for it. The point in this diversion is that worship of God should not be the thing that gets slided. If we have issues, good intentions, cannot make wrong religion, right. We don't tell God how it is going to be. But good intentions, if truly good intentions should help us when we see that we are wrong, to stand corrected, to follow God's way. And when we do, let's do it with all the warmth, and all the joy that God deserves. And not be sidetracked by bitterness. This evening, the Gospels invitation stands open, as it does in all places in all times. But here's a moment, a moment that we give within the Assembly, where you have the hands of all of these saints, who are striving to bring the blessing back to God. Here's a holy precessional if you cannot be a part of it, in the state that you are in if you are outside of Jesus Christ, and you need to be baptized for a mission of your sins, if you're a child of God, and you know that your life is out of sorts, your habits are out of sorts, Your fellowship is out of sorts, and that can be fixed by praying with the saints by coming before and confessing your faults at the throne of Jesus Christ. That's part of why we've been given to one another so that we can do that for each other as Christ body. So if you would like to take advantage of that, at this time, come forward while we stand and while we sing
