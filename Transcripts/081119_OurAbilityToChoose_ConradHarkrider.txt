Do you have a Bible and one of the opening up to the book of Ezekiel, chapter 18, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Lamentations Ezekiel, about halfway through your Old Testament, but that's what we're going to be studying this morning. Ezekiel 18. It's good to be with each of you this morning. It's a beautiful Lord's day and a blessing for us to be able to come and worship together and to study God's Word. One of the things that our family really enjoys doing together before bedtime is reading stories. And the over the last several years, I've learned a couple of things about children's books, I learned that there are some that are really good, and some that don't make a whole lot of sense. And I've also learned that kids like to read the same book over and over and over again, which is why some books are now hidden in the closet. But we've been lately we've been asking for some recommendations about some books that have a positive message a, they're not just about a elephant that falls into a puddle of water, but they have some sort of meaning and lesson that they teach at the end. And so one of the books that was recommended was a book titled What would Danny do? It's a pretty neat book, it's about a little boy named Danny. And he encounters different scenarios throughout his day, he doesn't get the plate that he wants at breakfast, or someone says something to him that isn't nice, or someone laughs at him. And Danny has to make a choice, he has to make a decision. And based on what he decides, and what the children who are listening decide. The book has,

Conrad Harkrider  01:56
I think, nine different endings of how his day could turn out. And the first time we read the book, Danny made all the right choices. And he had a great day. And the next time we read it, the kids were like, I want to see what happens when Danny is bad. And I'm thinking, I don't know if this is helping. I don't know if this is a good thing or not. But isn't it true that the the ability to choose is powerful, when we're faced with maybe two different roads to go down. And we have to make a decision about where we're going to head that is those can be critical moments in our lives. And so this morning, I want to look at a passage from Ezekiel 18 As we think about this idea of making a choice, our ability to choose in Joshua Chapter 24. In verse 15, Joshua said to the people, choose for yourselves who you will serve, are you going to make the choice to serve the gods who were on the other side of the river? Or then he says, As for me in my house, we will serve the Lord. So read with me as we think about which direction we're going to take. Read with me and Ezekiel, chapter 18. And verse one, Ezekiel 18, it says, The word of the Lord came to me again, saying, What do you mean when you use this proverb concerning the Land of Israel, saying, The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children's teeth are set on edge? As I live, says, The Lord God, You shall no longer use this proverb in Israel. Behold, all souls are mine, the soul of the Father, as well as the soul of the son is mind, the soul, this the soul who sins shall die. But if a man is just and does what is lawful and right, and if he has not eaten on the mountains, nor lifted up his eyes to the idols of the house of Israel, Nora defiled his neighbor's wife, Nora approached a woman during her impurity, if he has not oppressed anyone, but as restored to the debtor, his pledge, has robbed no one by violence, but has given his bread to the hungry and covered the naked with clothing, if he has not exactly a usury nor taken any increase, but has withdrawn his hand from iniquity and executed true judgment between between man and man. If he has walked in my statutes and kept my judgments faithfully, he is just, he shall surely live, says the Lord. The Book of Ezekiel was written from Babylon, Ezekiel has been carried off into Babylonian captivity, and he writes to God's people to warn them about God's judgment, but he also provides a message of hope. You remember Ezekiel 37, about the dry bones and he says that, even though the nation of Israel was like dead, dry, parched bones that one day God I'd would breathe new life into him into them, he would cause them to live again. So there's this message of optimism that he gives to the people. But he's writing to them during one of their darkest times, it's difficult for us to imagine how they would have been feeling this is God's chosen people. They were in God's promised land. But now all of those promises seem to have failed because they have been captured, their land has been decimated. They've now been carried off into the land of Babylon into captivity, and there would have been feelings of hopelessness, and despair. And in that question of why, why has this happened to us? Why is God allowed us to be in this situation? Well, here in chapter 18, there appears to be an explanation that's given this proverb that is going around the people as to why these things have occurred and why they've been punished. Did you notice what was said in verse two? It says, The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children's teeth are set on edge. What does that even mean? The fathers have eaten sour grapes, and the children's teeth are set on edge. Well, when you eat something that is sour, what happens to your face? Or if you eat something that is spicy, or really hot? What happens? Your expression starts to change,

Conrad Harkrider  06:26
maybe you're opening your mouth, blinking your eyes, you start to sweat, maybe you need a glass of water. Those are the effects of, of eating something like that. But would it make any sense if I ate something that was sour or spicy, and my children needed a glass of water, or their faces started to turn or change, and the impact was on then that doesn't make any sense. The children of Israel were saying that the fathers were the one who ate sour grapes. But it was the children who were feeling the effects. They were the ones that were being impacted. And so what do they mean by saying this? Well, the sin and the rebellion of their forefathers of the generations that came before them, that's what ultimately brought about this calamity. That's why they're in this situation here in Babylon, because they've been carried off into captivity and stripped of their freedom, because of the mistakes of others, because of those who have gone before them and the decisions that they made.

Conrad Harkrider  07:32
Well look at what God says to them. In verse three, he says, I, as I live, says, The Lord God, You shall no longer use this proverb. In Israel, the Lord is not happy about this, that this is the way that they're thinking or seeing this. And so he sends Ezekiel to sort of open their eyes, and show them the true picture the reality of their situation of what's actually going on here. And that brings us to our, our first point, when we think about our ability to choose, we see that we are personally responsible. We see this idea of personal responsibility. Look at what verse four says, Behold, all souls are mined, the soul of the Father, as well as the soul of the son is mine. And then he says, The soul who sins shall die. He starts by saying that all souls are mined the soul of the Father, as well as the Son. And this speaks to our accountability to God. That is that we have free will. We have the ability to choose, well, ultimately, we were created by the Lord. And one day, we will give an account to him for the things that we've done. He's the one that's made us, if you borrow your parents car, and you take it out one night, you are the one that makes the decisions about where to go. You decide how fast to go, when you need to slow down, if you're going to turn right or left, you're in the driver's seat. But that's not your that's not your car, you don't own that vehicle. If you make this choice to get up on the curb, or to go across the median or down the bank. You're gonna have to have a conversation with mom and dad about those choices. Because it's not you don't own that vehicle. And the Lord says all souls are mine they belong to me one day we will ultimately give account for the things that we do in our bodies, whether good or evil. But it also speaks to God's care for us when he says that all souls are mined This is to say that God is concerned about every person. He doesn't just deal with older people with elders and fathers and sons. And the former generation, but he's concerned with younger people with the little ones with those who come after. He doesn't show prejudice or bias, or he doesn't arbitrarily pick one generation over another, but he extends his grace to all people. And the fact that these people were suffering and being punished was not because of something that their fathers had done, and they had had nothing to do with it. But rather, God was passing judgment on them. Because they themselves had acted foolishly, and turned away from the Lord. So the principle that he lays out here is that the soul that sins is the one that will will die. If a father is evil, he's going to be punished for his for his actions. If a son is evil, he's going to incur judgment. But on the flip side, if a son is righteous, then God goes on to say three is equal, that he's going to be accepted, he's going to be received. Each one is personally responsible for their actions. So what are some implications of this? What are some examples of this? Well, just because a person is righteous, just because we know of someone who loves God, they want to do what's right, they want to serve God doesn't automatically mean that their children will follow the same path. Each person makes their own choices. Parents, of course, have a tremendous responsibility and looking after and training and teaching their kids to, to honor God to obey God to respect him. But we should be careful about making blanket assumptions that if we see somebody who's doing wrong, then that's automatically the result of something that that their parents did something that happened when they were being raised. And you can clearly see this with the kings of Judah, the secession of kings in the in the nation of Judah, there would be a few years of good kings, and then they would have a bad king, King Hezekiah was a great king. We're told that he served the Lord with all of his heart he restored worship in in Judah like it hadn't been in some time. He reinstituted the Passover, and brought the people back to their, their heritage of serving and following God. In Second Kings chapter 18. And verse five, it says, of Hezekiah, he trusted in the Lord, the God of Israel, so that there was none like Him among all the kings of Judah, after him, nor among those who were before him, for he held fast to the Lord. He did not depart from following him, but kept the commandments of the Lord, that the Lord commanded Moses Hezekiah was faithful to God, and made sweeping changes across the nation. But do you remember who his Do you remember whose son was the one who assumed the throne after Hezekiah was Manasa. And Manasa, potentially was the worst, maybe the worst King that ever ruled over the nation of Judah, he did so much to reverse all that Hezekiah had done, he instituted idol worship, he transformed God's temple into a place where the false gods would be honored. He even sacrificed His own children, to these idols. And so Manasa did a tremendous amount of harm to the nation of Judah. But what we see is each person is free to make their own choices, whether it's good or evil. And we see this with other people in the scriptures, Eli and his sons, Samuel, the Prophet and his sons, King David and his son, Absalom, and ultimately, Solomon would turn away from the Lord. And so we need not make impossible standards for people or place things on other people that are unrealistic. There's also another side to this, and that is that we are not bound to the decisions of our of our parents, of our neighborhood of our community of our city or country, or whatever it may be. Some of you may have had really lousy parents, people that weren't involved, they didn't care or when they were around, it was always tension or fighting or arguing, or abuse. And of course, those things have an impact on children on young people. But the hope of the Gospel, the promise of the Gospel is that we can be set free from those things. We're not destined to just follow down a path and be stuck in whatever those who came before us. We're doing in Christ we can be transformed. We can have this new life and be recreated and ultimately we model our lives after Jesus Christ, not after those who gave us life into this world? But we put to death the old way. And we are raised with Christ to live in a new way. But each one of us has this, this choice, this personal responsibility? Well, there's two really two paths that Ezekiel lays out here, the one who is just the one who is righteous, and then the one who is evil and who, who follows away of sin. And He says in verse nine, if he has walked in My statutes, and kept my judgments faithfully, he is just he shall surely live, to follow the way of righteousness. And justice is the path that that leads to life. And so when presented with this choice, notice that Ezekiel stresses the need to remove evil, to get rid of those things that might cause a person to go away from God or to stumble and turn their turn their back to the Lord. And so he highlights these things in beginning in verse six of the things that this righteous person doesn't do. They've removed these things from their lat from their life. He says in verse six, if he has not eaten on the mountains, this is a person who doesn't worship other gods. In verse seven, he also or in verse six, he also doesn't engage in inappropriate sexual activity in verse seven. And this is one who doesn't oppress or rob other people. In verse eight, they don't lend at interest in the Law of Moses got it forbidding the Jews from lending their money to make a profit at interest. And the reason for that was because if people were borrowing money that often signaled some type of dire need, they were destitute. And so to charge that person, interest would just be adding to their their difficult situation, you be placing an additional burden on them. He says that he withdraws his hand from iniquity, he doesn't practice injustice. And so these are all the things that this person doesn't do. When we think about what it means to be righteous. We often think in these terms, we don't, this is a person who doesn't lie. They don't cheat other people, they don't steal, they don't lust, all the things that you don't do. And let me tell you, that is really important. To have Christ like character, we have to remove those things, the sin and evil practices from our lives, and to live a life that is pure to live a life that is that is wholly that is different from how the world lives. Earlier this summer, my family and I took a trip down to Chattanooga, where Wes and Laura Oliver are now staying where they live. And Westlaw used to be members here. And we stayed with them for a couple of days. And on Saturday morning, one of our kids woke up. And she said that her foot was hurting. And so I looked at the bottom and notice sure enough that there was a splinter that was lodged down into her heel. So I put my daddy Doctor hat on. And I got the tweezers out and I started to work on it for about 10 minutes. And she asked me she said, Dad, daddy,

Conrad Harkrider  18:38
did you get it? I said, No, it's in there deep. And so Wes was in the room, and he kind of saw what we were doing. And I looked over at him. I asked him I said you want to give it a try. Now for those of you don't know Wes is a former Vanderbilt lifeflight nurse and has worked in the ER and seen just about everything. And so he gets down there. And he works for about five minutes. And then he looks up and I said, Did you get it? And he said, No, it's in there deep. And so that kind of made me feel good. In a way. It just validated my attempt. I was sad that we didn't get the splinter. But at least he didn't get it either. You know, removing something from your life, whether that be a sinful habit or a sinful relationship. Or if it's some type of perpetual sinful thinking. That's not easy. That takes a lot of effort. It takes focus, it takes attention it takes time. You know, sin has a way of burrowing itself deep into a person's life. and it gets in there. And that's one of the reasons why it's so important for us as we identify sin. And as we see it pop up in our lives, that we don't allow it to stick around those types of things. They work deeper and deeper and they become much harder to remove. When something is lodged deep into our way of thinking, there's going to be some work that's required to take that out to remove it. But Jesus says that it's important that if if something, there's something that causes you to sin that causes you to stumble, it would be better for you to, to cut it off, to throw it away from you, then allow that thing to continue to cause you to, to make mistakes or to misstep in judgment. Overcoming Tim's temptation often requires some type of drastic measure. Maybe it means that you have to change the group of friends that you're in, maybe it means that you change jobs, or you move to a different place. Or you have to get rid of that cell phone or that internet access, or whatever it may be. But when we identify it, working, to remove it from our lives, in Colossians, chapter three and verse five, it says, Put to death, therefore what is earthly in you, sexual immorality, impurity, passion, evil desire, and covetousness, which is idolatry. We have to make the choice every day, to put to death, those things that were a part of our old way of thinking, our old way of living, becoming a Christian is, it's just the first step. It's just the very beginning of the journey. But from that point on, it is a constant process, to be like Christ, to think like Christ, and to remove these things from our lives. Well, this text in Ezekiel 18 goes on. To say that being righteous is more than just avoiding the bad it's more than just what we don't do. Not only must we remove sin, but he also says that we have to replace it with good, we have to put something in place of those evil thoughts and desires and actions. Notice what he says in verse seven here. He says, if he has not oppressed anyone, but as restored to the debtor, his pledge, has robbed no one by violence, but has given his bread to the hungry and covered the naked with clothing. So you notice the things that this this person here that's righteous does, they restore the pledge, they give bread to the hungry, they provide coverings, this is a person that is mindful, they care about other people. They are not just worried about themselves and thinking about their own life and needs and wants, but they are conscientious. They're aware of what's going on around them the needs that might be around them. This is a person who verse eight executes judgment or true justice.

Conrad Harkrider  23:16
They are if something is given to them, they're fair, they act with integrity, they are doing the right thing, even when it may be unpopular or hard or difficult. In verse nine, he says, this is one who keeps my judgments. And he keeps them he keeps his statutes faithfully. This is with his whole heart, his or her whole heart. They're dedicated to serving the Lord and keeping his ways. Removing sin is critical. Not doing things that harm ourselves or our families or those around us is vitally important. But but being a child of God is more than just not engaging in things that are wrong. It means that we're proactively striving to do things that are good. What if I told you about a man who I said was a good husband? And I describe the reason why he was a good husband because he never beat his wife. He never gambled the family's money. He never abused anyone. And he always came home at the end of the day. Now, is that a good husband? I don't know. You can't really tell just because a person is not doing all the things that might get them thrown in prison doesn't doesn't necessarily mean that they have a good character. A good spouse is someone who is considerate. It's someone who is selfless. They think about the needs of others. They put their family's interests ahead of their own. And so it is in our own walk With Christ, if we are pursuing righteousness, it's not just the absence of things that we don't do but But what are we seeking to do in our lives? Or how are we looking to help and to encourage and to build up the body of Christ? Are we focused on those outside of the body looking for opportunities to help them? Are we a passive member? Do we come with an attitude of? Well, what's in it for me? What am I going to get out of this? Or are we thinking about those around us, and how we can help them and encourage them? Jesus told a parable about a man who had entrusted his property to His servants. And he gave each of them different portions. You remember the five talents, and the different amounts? But what about the one who had received just one talent? What did he do with what the master had had given to him? He didn't lose it. He didn't spend it or give it away or throw it away. But yet he buried it in the ground. And the master is displeased because he didn't make the best use of what he had been entrusted with. And so

Conrad Harkrider  26:22
it's important for us not just to think about removing the weeds from our garden, but also about planting. Things that will bear fruit things that will grow and produce and drawing closer to God and not just avoiding things that are wrong. Think about the easiest place for a wild file a wildfire to burn. You see these huge forest fires that burn in California and places like that. It's forests that are very dry, they are filled with trees that are dead, they are at higher altitudes, so the lightning can strike easier. And when that flame gets going, it just burns and burns. It's very difficult to put out. But what about a place where it's very green, there's lots of vegetation, it rains all the time. You don't see very many wildfires breaking out in the Amazon and the rain forests, because the conditions aren't suited to it. And so it is with our hearts with our Christian walk, we need to be thinking about how can we create an environment where it makes it very difficult for sin to come in, where it makes it very challenging for discontentment or ingratitude to take hold of our hearts. We thought we focus on things that are positive. We speak highly of other people instead of always criticizing or tearing down or looking for the wrong in other people. In Colossians chapter four and verse two. Paul says Devote yourselves to prayer, keeping alert in it with an attitude of thanksgiving. If we are constantly filling ourselves up with prayer and with thanksgiving and gratitude to God, it makes it much more challenging to look around and be unhappy about the things that we don't have. We serve others it helps us from being selfish, and it helps us keep things in their proper perspective. So we were move the evil and replace it with what is good. Well, as we close this morning, I want to finish with verse 31 of chapter 18 is eaglet 1831. He says, Cast away from you all the transgressions which you have committed, and get yourselves a new heart and a new spirit. For Why should you die oh house of Israel. That's the last point that we're going to think about this morning. And I just left it as the New King James says it there. Get yourselves a new heart. I love that. It's like they need to go down to the hardware store and find themselves a new heart. If you remember in Ezekiel, this is a theme that comes up in Ezekiel chapter 36. He talks about how they had this heart of stone. It was a heart that was cold. It was bitter, it was indifferent. It was unyielding to God. And God says I'm going to remove that heart of stone and I'm going to replace it with a heart of flesh. I'm going to give you a new heart that is soft, that is responsive and tender and willing to listen. When we talk about making choices. Ultimately God is concerned with people's hearts. Yes, he wants us to see he wants to see us choose right and not choose wrong. But it's never been about just keeping the commandments. God wants us to change from the inside out. that our deeds and our actions and thoughts would be a reflection of what's on the inside of what we truly feel and believe. In Leviticus chapter 23, God had told his people not to harvest their crops all the way up to the edge of their fields, he wanted to leave, he wanted them to leave the corners, the edges from being harvested, and what was the purpose of that? It was a provision that they had to follow. But the, the meaning or the significance behind it was to provide for those who were in need. God had placed this law in his in the Law of Moses, because he's trying to teach his people about the importance of caring for others, helping those who are in need. And so it is for us we,

Conrad Harkrider  30:48
we need to always keep in, in our minds, what is the spirit of this? Why does God ask us to do this? And why does God want us to engage in these things, and to be able to say, as David did create in me a clean heart, O God and renew that right spirit within me. We're going to close this morning with a song and it's an opportunity for those who are here. If you have a need to respond to God's invitation if there's something that we can do to pray with you to help you to grow closer to God to move forward in your walk with Christ than we want to. We want to take that time to do that this morning. If you have a need, please come down to the front as we stand and sing the song
