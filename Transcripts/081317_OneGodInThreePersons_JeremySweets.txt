Good morning. I have a full crowd here today have many visitors. We appreciate your attendance. appreciate the fact that you're here with us. Our goal at Broadmoor, I say this often I'll probably keep saying, our goal abroad was to give God glory and honor and praise and all that we do, both here in our assembly, but also as we leave here. So we appreciate the fact that you're here with us. And we appreciate that you've helped us worship God. This morning, we invite you back any any chance that you have. We've been talking this year as a theme, we've had Kingdom citizens. And last week I began looking at a sermon talking about God as Kingdom citizens, we need to focus on God and who he is as our King. And I'd like to continue that, that subject this morning. But if you would indulge me for just a couple moments, I'd like to mention a couple of things before I begin in Romans 12, in verse 15, it says, Rejoice with those who rejoice and weep with those who weep. I'll try to say this quickly. So Jeremy, I appreciate your prayer. And the congregation loves you and Lauren very much. There are others. There are others in this congregation hurting as well. We are praying for deja Sanders and Swafford refrain for the Andrews with Madonna Andrews, and there's many others that that we think about and care about. So Jeremy, and Lauren, we love you very much. Secondly, I was saddened to hear news yesterday that there was a march by white nationalist in Virginia, and ended up being a death in that situation. I'm not going to preach on that, but simply to say that as Christians, we we certainly denounce the hatred that's exhibited in that kind of display. As Christians, we denounce violence that would occur. And we simply hate that the gospel message is a message of peace. We're certainly in a battle in this country, aren't we? We're in a spiritual battle. And we need to fight that spiritual battle, not not with, not with physical weapons, but with spiritual weapons, the word of God. And so I just wanted to state that, here this morning.

Jeremy Sweets  02:33
We're going to be talking about God. This morning. Last week, we looked at the fact that there is one God. In fact, we looked at some foundational statements found in Scripture, as Jesus, God led the Israelites out of captivity, when he gave them the 10 commandments, he says, I am the Lord your God who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery, You shall have no other gods before me. In part, the Old Testament shows us the contention between God and the many gods so called Gods of the nations, the world was a polytheistic world society where they worship many gods but the God of heaven, the creator, the one, the only one and true God, showed those gods to be false. And he did that in many ways, and the exodus in contest Mount Carmel, and in many other ways, and Deuteronomy, chapter six, one of the foundational statements for all of Israel, it says, Here, O Israel, the LORD our God, the Lord is One, the Lord is one. There is one God and I believe that's a foundational statement found in particularly in the Old Testament. That's also a statement found in the New Testament. But as we come to the New Testament, we see that there's a greater nuance or detail that is provided for us. There is one God in three persons, one God in three persons in Romans chapter one, Romans chapter one, and verse 21. Look at that passage there. For since the creation of the world, His invisible attributes, His eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly seen, being understood through what has been made so that they are without excuse. Romans begins with the fact over the first several chapters that all have sinned in the presence of God. And that's not dependent upon nationality. That's true for both Jews and Gentiles. That's true for every body, All have sinned in the presence of God and stand condemned because of their sin. That's true for those that were non Jews, those that did not have that special relationship that God had with Israel in the Old Testament. But God says that They are still condemned. And notice what he says here in Romans chapter one and verse 20. For since the creation of the world, His invisible attributes, the attributes of God, that there is a God, that He is mighty and powerful, that there is an intelligent being that creator all things, the invisible God can be seen through what he's shown us. And that's found in nature. As we look at the stars and the expanse of Heaven and the intricacies of nature, we see that this was not happenstance, a great and mighty and awesome God created this. Now we may not know his name, we may not know or will not know what He expects of us, we will not know that he led the Israelites out of out of Egypt. We will not know that He sent His Son to die on the cross, but we can know that there is a gong. The text here says it talks about his eternal power and divine nature, divine nature, the King James translate this word as as God head, godhead,

Jeremy Sweets  06:18
there is a godhead, three persons in one there is a divine nature or essence that is found. And we see that it is this deity, this divinity, this Godhead that can be seen and understood the fact that there is this God Ness. And so we see the divine nature is what can be known. Now that tells us as we look throughout scripture, and combine that with the fact that we see three persons in one God, notice this divine nature, it says that it can be seen from the creation and because of the creation. Creation plays a pivotal role in and what we see about God and who he is. In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth, we see that God is the Creator, the father is the creator and Isaiah 64 In verse eight, there it says, But now Oh, Lord, You are our father. You are the potter, we are the clay, we are all the work of your hand. God the Father created all things. But when we open up Scripture, we also see that Jesus Christ was at the beginning of creation, turning your Bibles to John chapter one and verse one. Now, notice what it says there. In the beginning, we just looked at Genesis one, one we see God created all things. And here we see in John one, one, in the beginning, in the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. Later, we'll see this word identified as Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ was in the beginning, he had no beginning himself. He was not a created me, but he was in the beginning with the Father. Notice further it says, And the Word was with God, and the Word was God. That's a passage I memorized as, as a youngster. And it's something I can say pretty quickly and get through it. In the beginning was the Word and the Word was with God, and the Word was God, but stop and reflect on that. What that is saying. We know there is one God, that's a foundational statement throughout Scripture, but here it says that Jesus Christ said he was with God, and he was God. Now, how is that possible? We see that's possible within the Godhead. Jesus Christ is a different person than the Father. Their actions are not the same. They are different as far as their person, but they are one as God. And that's how I can say the word was with God, and the Word was God. We also see in Colossians chapter one, and allow me to read that passage, says he is the image of the invisible God, the first born of all creation. For by Him all things were created in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities, all things were created through Him and for Him, and He is before all things and in Him all things hold together. In Romans one we see that the deity or the Godhead, the divine nature of God can be seen are understood. And we see from passages like Genesis one that God was in the beginning the Father, we also see that Christ was in the beginning, Christ was Creator of all things. He was with God, He was God. We also see that the spirit was at the beginning in creation in Genesis chapter one and verse one, in the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth, you'll notice verse two, it says, and talks about the earth being formless and void, and the Spirit of God was hovering over the waters of the the, the Spirit of God was there was with God was God, and job 26 And verse 13, it says, by his wind or spirits by the spirits, the heavens, were made fair. So when we think about one God in three persons, we see that there is one God that created all things. We also see that God the Father, God, the Son, God, the Spirit are all there and creating, there is one God in three persons. Notice also that Jesus

Jeremy Sweets  11:19
was God in the flesh, Jesus took on flesh. And this was a point of major contention in the New Testament as the Jews would have looked to one God, but they didn't understand that Jesus came as the Son of God, that Jesus came as one that would show and represent and glorify the Father. In fact, that's been a point of contention, even after the New Testament, the question of who is this Jesus is a question that we need to answer. But we see that Jesus became God in the flesh, she took on human form, in Philippians, chapter two and verse seven, says that he did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped, although he was in the form of gun, but he emptied himself by taking the form of a servant, being born in the likeness of men. Taking the form of a human, it says in Philippians, chapter two, Jesus did not count equality or consider his deity as something to hold on to. In fact, he allowed his position he let that go so that he could come down to earth and serve. Now as the king, he doesn't need to serve does, but he allowed that position to go, I don't believe he let go of his deity. That's not what I'm trying to say. But he allowed that position to go so that he could come and serve and take the form of a man. We see that Jesus Christ took on flesh, and John one verses one through three, and the beginning was the Word and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. Same was in the beginning with God, all things were created by Him and without Him was not anything made. That was me. We see later in verse 14, who that word is, that word is the one that took on flesh. It says, And the Word became flesh and dwelt and live among us. Jesus Christ was and is God, God and he took on flesh and cloth Colossians, two verses nine and 10, we talked about that word, divine nature, essence, or or Godhead. In Colossians. Two, it says, For in Him, speaking of Jesus Christ, the whole fullness of deity dwells bodily. In Jesus Christ, the fullness of deity dwells, the fullness. There is a question in the book of Colossians is Christ enough? Maybe you need Christ and something else, maybe some secret knowledge, some kind of mysterious, you know, handshake, I don't know what they all said that you needed, but you need Christ and something else. And Paul says, Christ is sufficient. Christ is all uni, and in him is the fullness of deity. He is God, He is God. Not partially. Not in part, but in whole, in whole. And I think this is a point that people still struggle with, and it's a little bit hard to wrap our heads around how the divine nature, the divine essence, God could take on flesh. And that's something we need to think about and dwell on and I don't have every answer for every possible thing, but I know scripture, and I trust it and believe it and also know that that in doing that, Jesus Christ provided and brought salvation for all of us, God sacrificed himself the only sacrifice that would do in order to wipe away sin for us, Jesus Christ took on flesh. Let me also notice that when he came to the earth, Jesus, that He was still one with God and one, God. Notice that Jesus is one with the Father in John 10, in verse 30. It says, very simply and plainly in one statement, I am the Father are One, I and the Father are one in John 14, and if you would go ahead and open your Bibles to John 14.

Jeremy Sweets  15:58
We looked at this passage a few weeks ago, he says, Let not your heart be troubled, you believe in God believe also in Me, In my Father's house are many mansions or dwelling places, and he tells them about the fact that he's going to leave. But when he leaves, he's going to prepare a place for them so that they can come and be with him. And he would receive them. He goes on to say in verse six, I am the Way, the Truth and the Life, No man comes to the Father except through me. There is no other way. You know, on your maps, you got all these different ways to get from location A to B, and you can click on another one, maybe there's traffic here, I'm gonna go another way. I'm gonna choose an alternative route. But in Christ, and to the Father, there is no alternative routes. There is no one that goes to the Father except through Christ. Notice in verse seven, he says, If you had known me, you would have known my Father also, to know me, he says, is to know the Father. From now on, you know him, and I've seen him. You have seen the Father. But notice what Philip says in verse eight. Philip said to him, Lord, show us the Father, and it is enough for us. Jesus said to him, Have I been so long with you? And yet you have not come to Me, Philip? He who has seen me has seen the Father, how can you say, Show us the Father? Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in Me, the words that I say to you, I do not speak on my own initiative, but the Father abiding in me does his works, believe me, that I am in the Father and the Father is in Me, otherwise believe because of the works themselves. The language here reflects a great unity that exists within God within God the Father, and here as it mentions, Jesus Christ, to see Christ is to see the Father. We don't have to look at Christ and say, I don't know what the Father is, like, I'm looking at you. But I can't tell no, because there is a oneness between God the Father, and Jesus Christ. There is also a oneness between the spirit, and also Jesus in the Father. In John 14 and verse 16, just a few verses down. Again, Jesus is talking about the fact that he's going to physically leave the disciples, he is about to die. And he says in verse 16, I will ask the Father and He will give you another Helper, that He may be with you forever. This helpers identified in verse 17, that is the Spirit of Truth, whom the world cannot receive, because it does not see Him or know Him, but you know Him because He abides with you and will be in you. Here we see that the father, as Jesus leaves, the father is going to sin, the spirit, to remind and be with the disciples, remind them of Jesus Christ. Do you see the oneness that is tied up with the Spirit, Jesus and the Father? In chapter 15 And verse 16. He says, You did not choose me but I chose you and appointed you that you would go and bear fruit and that your fruit would remain so that whatever you ask of the Father in My name, He will give to you I read verse 16. I thought, that doesn't sound fair. Let me try verse 26. When the Helper comes, whom I will send to you from the Father, that is the Spirit of truth, who proceeds from the Father, He will testify about Me. Now notice the connection. The spirit comes from the Father. The Spirit testify of Jesus Christ. There is oneness in that revelation there is oneness in that truth. There is oneness in their action and what they are seeking to accomplish. There is a oneness between God the Father, Jesus Christ and the Holy Spirit's. In first Corinthians chapter two and verse 10. It says this, that the Spirit searches everything, even the depths of God. We can know what God says, because the Spirit has revealed it. Once again, we see a perfect harmony and communion, in one god that exists with God, the Father, the Son, in the Spirit, one God in three persons. I want to spend just a few moments looking at our relationship to this one, God, this one God, this one God in three persons,

Jeremy Sweets  20:58
has saved us. We owe our salvation to the one God in three persons. In Matthew chapter 28. Matthew chapter 28, Jesus after He was resurrected, came back and talked to his apostles and gave them a mission. He says, All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. Go therefore, and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all things, and long with you always even to the end of the A page. Notice here that disciples are made. And they are bad times, they are baptized for the remission of their sins into the very work of God and God brings salvation. Here it says also that they are baptized into the name of God the Father, God, the Son, and the Holy Spirit's. We are baptized into God, we have communion and fellowship with God, we are saved because of God and that consists of the Father, Son, and Spirit. And First Peter chapter one and verse two. First Peter, chapter one and verse two. Peter begins his letter by saying this is to the the elect exiles, the elect exiles and he goes on to describe them. They are the elect exiles according to the foreknowledge of God the Father, in the sanctification of the spirits, for obedience to Jesus Christ and for sprinkling with his blood. And then he gives a standard greeting, may Grace and peace be multiplied to you. Notice all three persons are mentioned there, and they they deal with and involved in our salvation. I've heard explained like this. And this is a summary that you might consider that God planned it, Jesus Christ executed it, and the Spirit revealed it, talking about the plan of salvation. Here we see a glimpse of that, don't we, in First Peter, one and verse two, it's according to the fall foreknowledge of God, the plan of God, Jesus Christ executed on the cross and that He died for the forgiveness of our sins. This passage points to the fact that we can be sprinkled with his blood, and we seek to obey Jesus. The Spirit has revealed it than that, and certainly includes this idea of Revelation we are set apart or sanctified by the very Word of God, John 1717. And here we see that the spirit sanctifies us, sets us apart. We are saved by God by three persons in one. We have fellowship with God, fellowship with God. Notice in Second Corinthians 13, and verse 14, Second Corinthians 13 And verse 14, the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all. Notice that which comes from God is grace, love and fellowship that comes from God, three persons in one, and we can have that in God. At first John chapter one and verse three. He says, that which we have seen and heard, we proclaim also to you, so that you too may have fellowship with us. And indeed, our fellowship is with the Father and with His Son, Jesus Christ. fellowship with both the Father and the Son On one God, in three persons, we've been saved by God, and we can have fellowship with God.

Jeremy Sweets  25:10
Let me also say that God's oneness is instructive for us. Because we have fellowship together. As we look to the perfect example of God, the Father and Son, and the Holy Spirit, we can have fellowship with one another. In First John chapter one and verse six. He says, But if we walk in the light as He is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus, His Son cleanses us from all sin, we can have fellowship with one another as we follow after God. Now let's go to John 17, turn your Bibles there, I want you to notice the relationship within God. And that points us to this concept of the relationship that we are have together. John 17 and verse 20.

Jeremy Sweets  26:15
Let me just preface this by saying that John is or Jesus is saying a prayer in this chapter for the unity of his disciples. Now in verse 20, is going to say, No, I'm not just talking about those physically, in my presence, he's going to be talking about all his disciples of all time, Notice, verse 20, I do not ask on behalf of these alone, but for those who believe in me through their word, that they may all be one, even as you father are in Me, and I knew that they also may be in us so that the world may believe that you sent me the glory which You have given me, I have given to them that they may be one just as we are one, I in them, and you and me that they may be perfect, perfected in unity, so that the world may know that you have sent me and love and love them, even as You have loved Me. Here, Jesus points to the relationship that exists within God. And he, he prays for his disciples that they would share that relationship. There is certainly one God, the Old Testament and New Testament bears out that fight. But it's even richer than we can imagine, as we consider three persons in one God, there is a relationship within God Himself. And we see from the very beginning that God values relationship. It's within his nature, the divine nature, the divine essence, there is a relationship between the three persons in one God, God values, that relationship so much that when He created us created humanity, he desired and wanted fellowship with His people. He wanted them to be with Him and to be close to him. And that's why he hates and despise the sin and rebellion. Because that that turns people away from God, we may think that God's not near me, maybe that's his fault. Isaiah says, it's not God's fault. It is our iniquities that have separated us from God. It's not because of any inability of God, either through shorthand or a deaf ear. Now, it's our sins. So we need to understand that within that relationship, that's what God wants with us. We see the importance of relationship within God. And we need to see that not only with ourselves and God, but with ourselves and others. God is one, three in one, and he works together in harmony to bring about his purposes. The church, Christians are to be united together, to be working for the same objective, to be proclaiming the gospel message together to be seeking to live holy lives together. That's why if one of us is caught in sin, we're friends together, if we correct that, you see, we're not going in different directions, you can have your sin, I'll have mine, we'll just all go in different directions. Now we're headed on the same path. That's the path that Jesus talked about in John 14, verse six, the path to God the Father, it takes its way through Jesus Christ. And so we need to be united in that goal, in that aim, in that, that procession, in that mission, of getting to heaven.

Jeremy Sweets  29:41
That's our purpose in life. That's our singular purpose in life is to get to heaven. And if you've missed that, you've missed everything. There is no second second place award. If you've missed that, you missed everything. So let us work together. Let us work with one another, Let us be mindful of one another. There's so many lessons we can learn as we just simply think and dwell upon God and who he is. And there's so much that we need to be doing because of that. So let us as a people, grow closer to Him in our relationship, let us grow in our knowledge of Him, Let's meditate on who he is, that will change everything. We talked in Trevor's class about hindrances to exhibiting the fruit of the Spirit. We need to reflect on God and meditate on him that will straighten our mind and remove the selfishness and the distractions that get in our way. It may be that you're here this morning and you're not a Christian, you have an opportunity to become a Christian this very morning, Jesus Christ died on the cross for you, not from one nationality for one subset of people, but for the entire world. And he offers salvation to all people. You must believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living God, you must repent of your sins and turn away from a lifestyle of sin, and, and to a lifestyle of service to God. And so you make a commitment for your entire life, I'm going to serve Him, confessing that Jesus is the Christ, the son of a living God and being baptized in the water for the forgiveness of your sins. If you're here this morning, and you are a Christian, you've made a lifelong commitment. Please don't ever give up on that. If you see someone else that struggling along the way, pick them up and help them. Let us all get to heaven together. There's any subject to the invitation. Please come as we stand and sing at this time.
