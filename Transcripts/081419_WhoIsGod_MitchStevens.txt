Good evening. It's good to be here with you all this Wednesday night to be a part of your series, I really appreciate the invitation to come and to be a part of it. I have many, many dear friends in this congregation, and through them and the times that I do catch up with them some more regularly than others, I have the opportunity to learn and to hear about the things that you all have going on your growth, your work. And I continually admire and appreciate this congregation from where I am not too far down the road over in Dixon. If you would turn in your Bibles with me to Acts chapter 13. I stepped slightly left of the theme. When brother Byers contacted me earlier this year, my first thought coming not to anything that Paul said in one of his letters. But what Luke said about Paul's preaching, and that's where we'll spend the balance of our time tonight. Do you ever just get overwhelmed by the amount of bad thinking and bad living that you see around you? Everywhere you look, and any program you watch, web pages, apps and sites that sometimes you visit all bombard you with the values of our age, the worship, there's no lesser word for what's done the worship of fame, and sex, and money, and power. These are visually presented to us so much, that it's hard not to become numb to this rampant idolatry of spirit. These things are empty by themselves. People know that. Deep down I think we all feel that in our core every person, but many don't know how to direct them, or with what to fill them in order to give them purpose.

Mitch Stevens  02:07
listen to people talk, you know, that's that's the most distressing thing of all the underlying principles of our age are that we are evolved by random chaos, from cosmic dust, that we are a fantastic accident of chance, not this. But this, particles in motion, just cruising toward oblivion. So you have that as the foundation, if you want to call it that. Second, there remains this hunger for things that are spiritual. And for that which is immaterial, because there is that which is immaterial about all of us, no matter how alone our highest thought shapers attempt to make us in the universe, people will always worship they will always follow somehow and often quite sideways, the impulse to sacrifice in service to something. So now emptied of knowledge about such things, people have these religious impulses that resemble something out of Star Wars. You know, God is a force that binds us and penetrates us. And there's this little bit of all in all of us and in everything around. We ought to live with a sense of duty, and courage to serve this thing that we will call God. The world that we see is not too different. At this point. It's faster getting that way more like the world that the church grew up in, back in the first century Roman world. That in a sense is not. There are things that are devastating about that, but we need not get a sense of defeat, because that is the world that the church flourished in. That is the world of the church sprouted forth and exploded. During the Apostle Paul's second missionary journey he visited Athens, Greece, Athens, it was ancient, even in Paul's day. You might call it something of an ancient tourist trap. By the time Paul gets there, I'm sure that they made quite a bit of money on the in the souvenir shops. And while while it was past its prime, it was still renowned as a center of learning, even though it might not have been the place where hot things were going on at the time. It was the birth place of democracy, freedom and the home of philosophy. Paul walked around the city with some time to kill and what did he see verse 16. Now while Paul was waiting for them at Athens, his spirit was being provoked within him as he was observing the city full of idols on Mars Hill where Paul was taken and given a hearing, there were statues dedicated with divine reverence to the government. There were all the many different religions of the gods all held to be equal, so long as none was taken too seriously. And scattered everywhere beyond these things, especially in the north west corner of the agora. were sexually explicit sculptures of specific parts of the human anatomy. It's stuff you just can't unsee as it's described to me. So it sounds like a lot of billboards and commercials that you see today, doesn't it? You don't know exactly where to plant your eye. Verse 17. So he was reasoning in the synagogue with the Jews and the God fearing Gentiles as well as his practice, and in the marketplace every day with those who happens to be present. And also some of the Epicurean and Stoic philosophers were conversing with him. So we're giving this key component these two key components to his audience, the Epicureans, were materialists. They believed that we are made up of atoms. And that's it. That sounds pretty familiar, doesn't it? As a base point for where we come from and what is taught to us, in their view, the gods didn't exist, or if they did, they were made up of physical material to and if they did exist, they didn't care one way or the other, really what we were up to, especially in regard to our day to day morals, a motto written by Diogenes and epicurean in about 8200, sums up this belief system. And it's this, nothing to fear in God, nothing to feel in death. Good. And by their definition, good would be pleasure, can be attained evil, and their idea of evil would be pain can be endured. Now, there's not a absence of virtue in this idea of good being something that is pleasurable, because being healthy, and being wise does make for a good life. But that's a pretty good boiled down view of the Epicureans. The Stoics believed that there was a divine rational ordering principle that was in all things and in all beings, sort of, again, that Star Wars is sense, or the Eastern sense of God. Concerning the question of God, they were cautious, but they were open. So the Epicureans meaning of life was to seek pleasure and happiness, the stoics put high stock in things like self sufficiency, courage, and duty. They were also highly principled in regard to ethical and civic duties. So you can almost see here within the Stoics, and Epicureans, something of a right left paradigm that all fit within this same idolatrous mess. But if you had said to a stoic or shown them one of our coins, and explained that the figures say in God, we trust they would have liked that. But then, like many Americans who also like it today, if you asked, in God, we trust what God describe him for me. You might get a broad, all inclusive, generic answer, ah, you know, God

Mitch Stevens  08:33
50 years ago, the word God in our country in our place, at least here in the West, would have had only one meaning would have been understood pretty across the board to be the loving, ethical god of the Judeo Christian tradition. That's becoming less and less. So. Today, the word means almost anything to a lot of people, there's so much less that you can take for granted, at the start of the conversation, especially in a growing urban area, like Nashville is now we're back to a point where we have to be prepared to persuade people who do not accept the authority of the Bible from the start. And as a result of that, many of them are going to argue with you, when you start talking about God, wait, what do you know about God? How do you know who this God is or what he wants? How do you know any better than I know? We're back to a point where we may need to use God's wider testimony, creation and human reason, not because they're better in some sense, because that's where our audience is currently at. And we need to hone them back in from Reason and creation, to history and to Revelation because that's the only way to truly find God. But we've got to start further back in the process than we might be trained or accustomed to, we have to establish the meaning of the word, God, we have to introduce people to God, who is God? The answer may strike some as offensive. So they're repulsed by it just just as an impulse. Others may ask, okay, you're presenting it just another world religion to be added to all the rest. Well, how does it go with Paul, verse 18? Some were saying, What would this idol babbler wish to say? These are the ones writing him off. You know, you don't call someone you're interested in hearing an idol. babbler others, he seems to be a proclaimer of strange deities, because he was preaching Jesus and the resurrection. And they took him and brought him to the area autogas saying, may we know what this new teaching is which you are proclaiming? For you are bringing some strange things to our ears? So we want to know what these things mean. Now, no, they will start where we still start, I wouldn't suggest that we don't start with Jesus and the resurrection. But we need like Paul to be ready to adjust and broaden and answer some really basic but big and deep questions. Verse 21, gives an important note all the Athenians in the strangers visiting there used to spend their time and nothing other than telling or hearing something new. That spirit is also in our age, whichever way they went, whether they were open or hostile, neither was acceptable for really considering the question of God. Because the question of God is the big question. It concerns us all it is the question that lies behind the very meaning of your life. Down to the details of what you do, you may there are a lot of things we do in our lives, most of which I would say that are on autopilot. But this is the question behind everything you are living according to your conception of who God is, at this very moment. Now to this audience, that's kind of a Yeah. But so is the person down the street? So are the people doing everything everywhere around us? Why are people constantly restless and unsatisfied. That's what they might say is driving them to make these little daily decisions. But what's behind that restlessness. All the issues that we have are symptoms of our struggle with the question of who God is, and what he wants for us or from us. Your marriage, your sexuality, your finances, again, those daily habits, your career goals, all of these come under your knowledge and your commitment to God, or lack of both. For all intents and purposes, any talk of God today is an idol to the unknown God.

Mitch Stevens  13:15
First 22. So Paul stood in the midst of the area esophagus and said, Men of Athens, I observed that you are very religious in all respects. For while I was passing through and examining the objects of your worship, I also found an altar with this inscription, to an unknown God. Therefore, what you worship in ignorance, this I proclaim to you. That's a very provocative start. Yes, it's all encompassing. It's also provocative, to tell a group of philosophers what you're ignorant of, I know. What is it that we must know about God?

Mitch Stevens  14:01
Now, some of what we must know about God, Paul says, Every person already has a sense of not implanted knowledge, but an implanted impulse, we have a blank space that is shaped just right, to be filled by the knowledge of the God of the Bible. The rest, we all have to be told. We have to be told by God Himself in His revelation, but it all starts with that automatic since the spirit within us that sees order and beauty and design and understands that somehow it matters to, to our also built in sense of destiny. We've got destiny in us and order around us and we just are hungry to put those pieces together in a satisfying way. Paul homed in on three areas is where the Stoics and the Epicureans were most vulnerable? First, he addresses the origin of life. They're ignorant about that. Where do we come from? Our age is ignorant about that. Second, he challenges them on the meaning of life. They and we, in this age are ignorant of that. Third, Paul concentrates on the end of life. He speaks of death and judgment, and you think he started it in an uncomfortable place? Not a very welcome intellectual topic, not then not now. So each of these three questions is caught up in the question that only the Bible can answer, who is God, God presents himself in the Bible by many different descriptive titles, and names. Each one presents something essential to us. And I want to sort of outline Paul's argument, not by just those three things, but also by four names, that through the Bible, God relates to us through Elohim, Yawei, father, and Jesus. The sense of these are all present in Paul's sermon, where they are not directly used. So the first answer deals with existence and non existence men say, God is nothing but matter and time and chance. To this, God says, Hello, my name is Elohim. God, the Creator. This is the name of Genesis one one in the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth, the name Elohim, is used over 2500 times in the Old Testament, the name is repeated 35 times just in Genesis chapter one in two in connection with God's powerful revelation in creation. This is simply translated as God in our English Bible, wherever you see God, the name God points to the power, the glory and the richness that lies behind the cosmos. So Paul starts his answer with the origin of life, who is God, He is the Creator of life. First 24, the God who made the world and all things in it, since he is Lord of heaven, and earth, does not dwell in temples made with hands, nor is he served by human hands as though He needed anything, since he himself gives to all people, life, and breath, and all things. This is the part of God that is, to a degree self evident. In fact, you cannot even deny God without to some extent describing him. Think about it. An atheist says, What do you mean when you say God? And you could challenge it was so are you an atheist? And they say, yes, we'll say, then then you can ask them. What is it that you're denying? You want to know what I mean by God? I want to know what you mean by God, when you're saying there is no God because in order to deny God, you have to have some sense of what you're denying, right? And you might even get the atheist to piece together a pretty good working definition of God, in the very denial that well, you know, the infinite the uncreated, the uncontentious being, that's, that's Ravi Zacharias, his word that's a smart atheist if he's going to use the word on contingent.

Mitch Stevens  18:43
But you'll get something like that, like, Okay, well, we do have some sense of what we're talking about. Romans one, verse 18, talks about this, this, this search for God that starts within our creative being, for the wrath of God is revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men who suppress the truth in unrighteousness, because that which is known about God is evident within them, for God made it evident to them. This is the general revelation idea. For since the creation of the world His invisible attributes, His eternal power, and divine nature, so something about what he can do and something about who he is that it is a personal force, that He is powerful, but that he is also personal and he is also intelligent, but he's also benevolent. All of it can be clearly seen being understood through what has been made, so that they are without excuse, which is why he says that they are condemned. Part of this is a conscious pressing down of the evidence. Men say God is nothing but matter time and chance That's where we came from. Is that what the science points to? Here's where you have that suppression idea, the dishonesty that audits forefront, Paul says you're condemned in this. What has been proven by scientific observation, just a few things that matter and energy are finite, the universe and life in it is moving from order to disorder, that the universe is expanding outward from a beginning point, that all energy is running down like a battery losing a charge, or a clock winding down or a fire consuming its fuel. What can be observed is that chaos does not breed complexity. Matter does not make mind as we say It's mind over matter, every time. What is science? It is built on a philosophical search for standards for unseen constants. It is an impulse within us and it's a discipline but it comes from seeing order. And what is it identify laws that can be followed, observed. That's what we call them right laws, because that's what they are. Every law has a law giver. That's the philosophy that underlies all science. There is mind behind order. In other words, where you see the unmistakable imprint of design, and down to our our genetic material, we see that we are coded. We must infer a designer, and that's God. Meet Elohim. Hebrews chapter three, verse four says, For every house is built by someone. But the builder of all things, is God. Chapter 11, verse three by faith, we understand that the worlds were prepared by the word of God, so that what is seen was not made out of things which are visible. We know that matter is not the thing that lasts forever. The Bible uses this argument, it builds on this rationale for God, not just Paul, not just New Testament, but old. Psalm 19, that beautiful psalm, The heavens are telling of the glory of God, and their expanse is declaring the work of his hands, chapter nine, Psalm number 90, verse one and two, Lord, you have been our dwelling place in all generations, Before the mountains were born, or you gave birth to the earth, and the world, even from everlasting, to everlasting, You are God, you are the constant the thing before there were things we didn't make him. We didn't rationalize him as a survival impulse. He made us who is God, He is the eternal cause behind all these effects that we see. He's the reason why there is something instead of nothing, the essential answer to the essential question. The second answer has to do with our knowledge of right and wrong. You see, men say, I think it's wrong to tell anyone else what to do.

Mitch Stevens  23:40
Well, first of all, that's self defeating. Because you should ask any person who says that, aren't you saying that? I'm wrong? It falls, it collapses from beneath them. But where the bigger question is okay, but you did, and you're looking for right and wrong. Where does that sense of right and wrong come from? In you, in me in everybody who ultimately gets to decide? How do you calibrate this sense of right and wrong? If I were to ask all of you here to show me three and three eighths inches on your hands, my yardstick is in the car. I brought it, but I'm not going to go get it because I don't know the range on this microphone. But if I just asked one row to do three and three eighths inches with their hands, well, first of all, I have already given you something a standard by which to guess what is an inch. It's some predetermined thing that we're all trying to strive for. And then in trying to figure out who gets closest to three and three eighths inches. My money's on Mike. Not that I would, you know, but we would need to determine Who is closest? And maybe one's right? Maybe we're all wrong. But we need this standard. We can't just look at each other. So we need this external thing if we if we didn't have one of those things, what would we have? We would have a bunch of opinions. That's true for the concepts of right and wrong, themselves. We need an external standard, what is good, what is right, this word that you use, what is love? God is the absolute standard named as such of all three of those things. He is that and he's a lot more because he's not a distance standard. He's not a yardstick out in the Dodge in the parking lot. Meet y'all way, the Lord God, our covenant maker, verse 26, and he made from one man, every nation of mankind to live on all the face of the earth, having determined their appointed times, and the boundaries of their habitation, that they would seek God, if perhaps they might grope for him and find him. Note some important words here, having determined why so that they would seek the Creator God did not merely get everything going, and then just leave it to spin into oblivion. Your way is the distinctly proper covenant name of God. So when he says, Hello, my name is Yawei. He's about to talk about you and him in the plan that he has.

Mitch Stevens  26:46
Now, this one occurs over 6800 times in the Hebrew Scriptures. And it starts way back in Genesis chapter two, verse four. This is the account of the heavens and the earth, when they were created, in the day that the Lord God made earth and heaven, Lord God, anytime you see, Lord, usually, and you have the Lord in lower small caps, you have this word. In Genesis one, the Creator God Elohim, made the world when he spoke, the spoken word intelligence, in Genesis to the Lord God Yawei is shown being hands on taking, forming, breathing into fashioning, and verse 16, commanding, so you have maker, and you have creator in terms of really getting in there, getting his hands dirty, and putting in programming and relationship, to command is to speak to relate to this is the name by which he introduced himself to Israel at the start of the exodus in a unique sense. He says, I want you to know that I am your way, say, therefore to the sons of Israel, I am the Lord, and I will bring you out from under the burdens of the Egyptians, and I will deliver you from their bondage, I will also redeem you with an outstretched arm, and with great judgment. So here you have again, God rolling up his sleeves, so to speak, and getting his hands dirty. You see your way is not just the God of rules, he is the god of relationship, his laws, the biggest ones, what you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, soul in mind in the second is like it, you shall love your neighbor as yourself. These are for drawing people near to him. And as they're drawing near to him, drawing near to each other, he speaks in nature, he moves through human history, so that he can be known by this personal name. So you can't just say, God, acknowledge that there is a Creator out there and be agnostic on everything else, and then be done with it. Make that term you know, God, just whatever you want. Hebrews 11, verse six, without faith, it is impossible to please Him, for he who comes to God must believe that He is and that He is a rewarder of those who seek Him, goes beyond what he is and what He has done into what he is to you and what he is willing to do and is yet doing. So in these first two big titles for God, from the Old Testament and onward, we see that God is powerful, and he is personal. These are big concepts Elohim and Yawei, the Lord God who works in creation and history, to make himself known. He sets the standard and then He guides us with the standard. You and I are not accidents. And God is not one option among a smorgasbord of maybes, God is the originator of life. He wants you to know Him. And it matters to him, whether you know him by the right name. And by the right attributes, just like you appreciate being known by the right name and the right attributes. And it matters to him whether you are doing the right thing. Here's where people object. And many times hold bitterly to this objection. Okay, well, then, if God is so good, and he is so involved, then why is there so much evil and suffering in the world? That's a very good question. And at the core of that question, is the concept of good and evil. Now, that's something an atheist has no sound basis for, in order to have a moral outrage, you have to have a moral standard. And here again, it's a long argument, but the end of it is that only God is the standard big enough to not make morality into something that's just a matter of preference.

Mitch Stevens  31:22
That said, we're still left with the question. Why does God conduct history, the comings and goings of man with all of its hurt, and all of its chaos? Why does he do it the way he does, verse 27, that they should seek God and perhaps feel their way toward him and find him. Yet he is actually not far from each one of us. For in Him, we live and move and have our being, as even some of your own poets have said he's quoting their people to them, for we are indeed his offspring. God is high above us. He is the standard of good and have right he is not like us. I wouldn't want him to be. But he's also among us. He is He's made us like him. He calls us children. God says, Hello. My name is Father. The concept of God the Father is present in the Old Testament, but it really takes off and it comes down to us in the new, very fittingly, it is his only begotten Son who enlightens us on that concept. First Corinthians eight five and six, Paul says, For although there may be so called gods in heaven, or on Earth, as indeed there are many gods and many lords, yet for us, there is one God the Father, from whom are all things and for whom we exist, and one Lord Jesus Christ, through whom are all things and through whom we exist. Matthew 626 Look at the birds of the air They neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. He's showing us how God acts fatherly Are you not of more value than they? Matthew 711 shows father Linus if you then who are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children. How much more will your Father who is in heaven give good gifts to those who asked him? What does a father do? He gathers to himself. And he provides. That's what Paul is standing there at Athens declaring the Heavenly Father is gathering all nations in. And so now Paul comes to his great finish his hard sell. He's covered the origin of life. He's just laid out the meaning of life and the mission of God. Now he turns to the end of life, verse 30, the times of ignorance God overlooked. But now he commands all people everywhere to repent, because he has fixed a day on which he will judge the world in righteousness by a man whom he is appointed. and of this he has given assurance to all and here's where he brings in history, and Christ by raising Him from the dead. A future judgment. That idea seemed unlikely to Paul's audience. As you've already seen people A is a babbler. What's he? What's he talking about? So that was ridiculous, as well as the idea of somebody rising from the dead. So that's why God did one in order to prove that the other one is happening to here there is something beyond life I just brought someone back from beyond life. Men say if God is so concerned with whether I believe, why doesn't he come down here and show himself? Have you ever heard an atheist or someone like that make this sort of thing? Well, if he cared so much, I want him to come down and show himself God says, Hello, meet the Son, Jesus Christ. He already did. Matthew one, verse 22. All this took place to fulfill what the Lord had spoken by the prophet, he laid the way for it. Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and they shall call his name Immanuel, which Matthew helpfully explains, is God with us. Jesus, the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us. And we have seen his glory, glory as of the only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth. No one has ever seen God that's part of the dilemma is this this demand that's made, the only God who is at the father side, he has made him known, he did come.

Mitch Stevens  36:11
Here is God's ultimate proof I delivered to you as of first importance, what I also received, that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures that He was buried, that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures. He really wants us to get that this happened. Witnesses saw him, hundreds of them. They heard him, they touched him. The evidence is still here to examine 2000 years later, and in Paul's day, he could say, go check it out. In Jesus Christ, God meets us as a commuter. He joins us where we are. And he invites us into an intimate fellowship with Him. He comes to bear our burdens. He comes to pick up and carry our sorrows, he picks up that last question about suffering, and takes it on and in to himself. In Jesus, we have the perfect manifestation of God's good intentions. Jesus demonstrated God's authority over creation, he spoke with authority as he introduced a new covenant. Jesus introduced us to his father, and he took the problem of evil and suffering to that cross with himself. And he solved the problem. He becomes the ruler. And I mean that in every sense, the standard, the ultimate solution, the transgression bearer. Everyone lives according to their conception of this question. Who is God and people grope after it, and miss it, by little, or by a lot, a little turns into a lot. Either way, we need a new start. And the good news is that God has made one and He guides us to it. He bridges the gap between the physical and spiritual, showing us the origin of life, giving us the meaning of life, and declaring what is beyond the end of life. And the most amazing thing, the first thing is that he did it all in person. Who is God? Meet Elohim, the powerful creator, the God who made the world and all things in it, the reason why there is something rather than nothing. Meet y'all way, the covenant maker the one who defines right and wrong and who sets the boundaries and appoints times having determined that we should seek Him. Meet God the Father, because he's not far from each one of us. For we are also his children. He is the one who is working for our good even now in the midst of evil. He defines the struggle. Meet His Son, Jesus Christ, the one whom he is appointed to judge the world, in righteousness. In Him is the resolution, the problem of evil and suffering. God is powerful. He is personal. He seeks relationship and he reveals himself how is the answer received? epilogue by the philosophers three ways. There are three ways that it can be received today to Now when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked, but other said, we will hear you again about this. The first of those is worse than the second, but functionally they're no different than theirs. Verse 33. So Paul went out of their midst. That's the break. But some men joined him and believed, among whom also were Dionysius the Ariana guite. And a woman named amorous and others with them. What is your response? It's not enough to merely be agreeable. Let's have another hearing. That's got to stop. By God's grace, hopefully before it's too late. It's not enough to be in full intellectual agreements. This is great stuff.

Mitch Stevens  41:05
The happy ending to the end of life for his for those who join with God, through the blood of His Son, Jesus Christ. That's offered tonight, that's offered as long as today is still called today. But why not tonight? If you need to become a Christian, or if as a child of God, you need your faithful Lord, who is presiding now in heaven. To grant you forgiveness, he's already promised He will. If we're faithful to confess, let this body work as it should, to confirm one another toward heaven if you need either of these things come forward while we stand and while we sing
