Unknown Speaker  00:01
Well, thank you for inviting me to be a part of this series. My family and I have been looking forward to this for a long time. And we have several connections with this group. And I didn't know how many connections and when I came in, oh, I went to school with him and her and in my daughter was so excited that she gets to see Cora tonight. So she was really excited to be with her. It's thrilled to be here, to get to know you. To learn more about you. I've heard so many good things about what God is doing through your work. And that is that is so exciting and helpful and encouraging. This this evening, I invite you to turn in your Bibles to First Kings chapter 21. And we're going to look at a story of a king acting extremely childish. I don't, I think you'd be hard pressed to find another story in the Bible that displays such a childish Keane as the one we're going to look at tonight and King Ahab, and his desire for name boths vineyard. The story certainly has a lot of valuable lessons for us. And I hope we will discuss some of those lessons as we study through this section of Scripture together. Let's go ahead and begin by reading the first four verses of this chapter together. Now it came about after these things that nave off the jazz Israelite had a vineyard which was in jazz REO beside the palace of Ahab, king of Samaria. Ahab spoke to nave off saying, Give me your vineyard, that I may have it for a vegetable garden, because it is close beside my house, and I will give you a better vineyard, then it in its place, if you like I will give you the price of it in money. But Naipaul said to Ahab, the Lord forbid me that I should give you the inheritance of my father's. So I have came into his house sullen and vexed because of the word which nabe off the giedre light had spoken to him for he said, I will not give you the inheritance of my father's. And he laid down on his bed and turned away his face and ate no food. I want us to try and picture Ahab in verse one, as he is in his palace, and maybe throughout the day, he keeps looking at this beautiful vineyard, day after day, year after year, and he's adds a beautiful vineyard neighbor has been working really hard and this is seems to be a good year for him. You know what, that would make an excellent vegetable garden. And I wouldn't have to walk very far in order to get my vegetables so I know what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna go and talk to a neighbor off and I'm just gonna give him an offer, that he will not be able to refuse and I will have my very own vegetable garden will nave off say says no. You can't have my vineyard. And he doesn't just say no. Notice verse three, the Lord forbid that you should get my vineyard because I don't want to give it to you. No, that's not the reason notice what he says in verse three that I should give you the inheritance of my father so why does knave author refuse a better vineyard or his vineyard in top dollar he understands when the Israelites gained the land they were given a piece of land that would stay in that family. So if knave off word to okay you can have it. Not only would he be losing his land, he would say son, the land that was going to be yours. Sorry, I sold it. The land that was going to be your grandchildren at that doesn't belong to us anymore.

Unknown Speaker  05:00
So what do you see in verse four? I see a two year old in verse four, by the way that Ahab reacts in a very, not well trained two year old. Notice what he does, he came into his house, the New American Standard, says Solon, and vexed.

Unknown Speaker  05:32
I want us to go up just a few verses to chapter 20. In verse 42, when was the last time this childlike King was sullen and vexed? Well, looking at that context, which really begins in verse 35, of chapter 20, Ahab was Solon and vexed when he was told that, basically because you gave up the key and let him go, you're going to die alive for a life. So, he was kind of sad about that he was sullen and vexed. Well, now here in chapter 21, because he did not get his way. He did not get his vegetable garden. He is the same emotion, sullen and vexed. But also if you keep breeding in verse four, it's because of the word that Naipaul said. And it seems to me, maybe he's throwing an even bigger fit than he did at the end of chapter 20. Now, he's not going to eat any food. So here we have his wonderful wife, coming to his rescue. Let's read together verses five through 16 and see what Jezebel does in this situation. But Jezebel, his wife came to him and said to him, how is it that your spirit is so Solon and that you are not eating food? So he said to her, because I spoke to neighbor the Jezebel Lord and said to him, give me your vineyard for money, or else if it pleases you, I will give you a vineyard in its place. But he said, I will not give you my vineyard. Decibel his wife said to him, do you now reign over Israel? Arise, eat bread, and let your heart be joyful, I will give you the vineyard of neighbor that Jesu light. So she wrote letters and Ahab's names, seal them with his seal, and sent letters to the elders and the nobles who are living with Napalm Death in his city. Now, she wrote in the letter saying, proclaim a fast, and seek neighbor, that the head of the people and seat to worthless men before him, and let them testify against him saying, You cursed God and the king. Then take him out and stone him to death. So the men of this city are his city, the elders and the nobles who live in his city did a jezzer bell had sent word to them, just that it is written in the letters which he had sent them. They proclaimed a fast and Sita neighbor that the head of the people, then the two worthless men came in and sat before him and the worthless man testified against him, even against knave off before the people saying knave off curse God and the king. So they took him outside the city and stoned him to death with stones. Then they sent word to Jezebel, saying knave author has been stoned and is dead. When guysville heard that neighbor had been stoned and was dead gizmo said to Ahab, arise, take possession of the vineyard of neighbor off the judge relied which he refused to give you for money, for knave off is not alive but dead. When they have heard that knave off was dead, Ahab arose to go down to the vineyard of nave off the Jezebel light to take possession of it. Jezza Bell, in my opinion, notices Why isn't my husband eating any food? Why is he so sad? What is what's going what's going on? And I don't know how, what tone or how you read verse six, but I read it like this. It's because I spoke to neighbor, the Jesu light and said to him, give me your vineyard for money or else if it pleases you, I will give you a vineyard in its place. But he said, I will not give you my vineyard. In that I feel sorry for me. Right? I offered him all that I could and he told me no. So that's why I'm not eating. That's why I'm so unindexed.

Unknown Speaker  10:30
And Jezebel says, Well, you had no right to that. One, you need to gotta get over yourself. No, she says, aren't you the King? Don't? Aren't you the one that tells people what to do? And remember, Jezza bell in chapter 16, verse 31, is the daughter of a king. So she has always gone through this motive of the King gets whatever he wants. So, Ahab, dear, why in the world? did you allow him to tell you know? Get up, eat, let your heart be joyful, and I will give you name boss vineyard. So Jasmine was giving her husband a guarantee. And at this point, we can just kind of only imagine how is Jezza Belle going to do this? Well, we see her plan and verses eight through 10, she sent a letter to the elders and nobles of naval city which the kings with the king seal on it, and gives commands to the leaders of the city proclaim a fast seat knave off at the head of the people. So by proclaiming of fast it saying something is wrong, this is no time for you to eat, drink and be merry, we need to be focused on something and putting knave off at the head of the people would signify. He is the reason why we have to fast he is our problem. And then get to worthless men to testify against a boss saying he cursed God and the king. It seems as though they had no problem finding two worthless people. That was the easy job. And in Exodus 22, and verse 28, God says you shall not curse God, nor curse a ruler of your people. So after you get two people to testify against him to lie, then you can go out and stoned him to his death. And this was the penalty for those who curse God and blasphemed. So in verses 11 through 14, they carry out this horrible plan. And to me, this shows you just how godless the elders and nobles of this city were. The nobles and the elders were supposed to be the leaders, the man who people would come to for advice for help. Here they are executing this wicked plan. And these two men, said, I fear Jezebel and the king more than I fear God. So in verses 12 and 13, the details of their obedience to the king and queen they proclaim a fast, they put in a vault at the head of the people, they get to worthless men who are willing to testify. The people believe that testimony and knave off is stoned to death but I want you to notice, mark your Bibles here in First Kings 21 in turn to Second Kings, chapter nine. And I want us to notice verse 26.

Unknown Speaker  14:29
So surely I have seen yesterday the blood of knave off and the blood of his sons, says the Lord and I will repay you in this property, says the Lord now then take and cast him into the property according to the Word of the Lord. So I want you to notice that it was not only nave off that they stone it was also his children. Why killed The children well, they would be next in line. Right? If their father died, then they would be the ones who inherited this wonderful vineyard slash vegetable garden. So they have him killed as well. I want us to really try to get this picture of what we are seeing from this wicked king and his wife. They are going to do anything they can to please themselves. It doesn't matter if they kill an innocent man if they kill his sons. Doesn't matter what extent they have to go to. They are going to get what they want. So they execute the plan they sin word back to Jezebel knave off is stoned. And his dead just to make sure right. stoned him in and he's dead. So, verses 15 and 16. Jezebel says I did it. Hey, honey, come in. I got some news for you. Didn't you hear that knave? auth is not alive but dead. Take possession of your vineyard. Now what is interesting is Ahab does not ask, well, how How did he die? I just see him with a big happy smile grin on his face, saying all right, I got my vegetable garden right next to the palace, just like always wanted. He must have concluded foul play was at hand but that didn't bother him. Well, God is in control. God knows exactly what has been going on. So he gives Elijah this message starting in verse 17. And will read the verb through verse 24. Then the word of the Lord came to Elijah the Tish by saying Arise, go down to meet Ahab king of Israel, who is in Samaria. Behold, he is in the vineyard of neighbouring where he has gone down to take possession of it. You shall speak to him, saying thus says the Lord, you have murdered and also taken possession. And you shall speak to him saying thus says the Lord, and the place where the dogs licked up the blood of neighbor, the dogs will lick up your blood, even yours. Am said to Elijah, have you found me, oh, my enemy? And the answer I have found you. Because you have sold yourself to do evil in the sight of the Lord. Behold, I will bring evil upon you and will utterly sweep you away. And we'll cut off from Ahab every male, both bond and free and Israel. And I will make your house like the house of Jeroboam, the son of me bad and like the house of Baker, the son of a Hijjah because of the provocation with which you have provoked me to anger. And because you have made Israel sin of Jezebel, also the Lord has spoken, saying the dogs will eat Jezebel in the district of Jezebel, the one belonged to Ahab who died in the city, the dogs will eat, and the one who dies in the field, the birds of heaven, will eat. So God tells Elijah, how want you to go meet Ahab. He is going to be in Naples vineyard, currently taking possession of that property, and I have a message that I want you to give him. And this is the message Have you murdered and also taken possession? So Ahab has successfully committed to have the 10 commandments.

Unknown Speaker  19:30
And do you think Elijah is just shocked at this news that Ahab would do such a thing? My guess is no. So this is this. This is the Ahab I know. And he says also the place where the dogs licked up navels blood they shall lick up your blood. So Ahab, is trying to take this property then This new wonderful vegetable garden that he has now acquired and then incomes, his enemy, it Elijah, and you have to love how they greet each other. Have you found me my enemy? In their first interaction together in chapter 17, Elijah tell they have, God is not going to send do or rain, except by the word of Elijah, three and a half years later God sent rain back on the land. And remember, when they saw each other for the Oh, it's you, oh traveller of Israel. And Elijah says, Look, I'm not the traveller of Israel, all these bad things are happening. And because of your sin, it's because you are leading the people astray. And then Elijah ordered Israel to kill the prophets of Baal after God demonstrated very powerfully, He is the true God after the challenge on Mount Carmel. And whenever Ahab and Elijah spoke with each other, it was normally bad news for Ahab. So here they have, he's excited. He's about to get his vegetable garden. And then here comes Elijah. My enemy has shown up at the worst time. And then verse 21, And why'd you replies, I have found you, because you have sold yourself to do evil. Look at Elijah saying, This is not my idea that I would want to come to you. It's not like I was sitting at home saying, What should I do? You know what, I'll go visit Ahab today. Now, I am here, because you have sold yourself to do evil. And God required me to go to you. Elijah's message from God was extremely powerful. I will make your house like the house of Jeroboam and Baisha. Because you have provoked the Lord to anger and causes people to sin. Well, what does that mean? Well, the house of Jeroboam, and the house of Baisha, were the really the two previous dynasties if you want to call them that, in the kings of Israel. If you want to count the mighty one week dynasty of Zimri Oh, okay. But really Jeroboam and his son, a whole family was wiped out. Same thing happened with Baisha and his son who became king, so he said, every person in your family is going to be wiped out. That's That's what he's saying. Furthermore, the dogs will eat Jezebel and the District of Jezebel and all they have is family will be either eaten by dogs if they die in the city or birds if they're outside the city. But I want us to notice, verses 25 and 26. Surely there was no one like Ahab, who sold himself to do evil in the side of the Lord. Because Jezza Bella's wife incited him, he acted very abominable, abominably excuse me, and following idols, according to all that the Amorites had done him the Lord cast out before the sons of Israel. Did those two verses fit? When you read the story? Does it fit with the flow of the story? Really, to me, these two verses are saying, Look, I want to highlight for you just in case you've missed it, just in case you didn't figure out Ahab was really bad. I want to show you that here. There is no one worse than Ahab. And amazingly, he found someone just as evil or maybe even more evil than his wife Jezebel. If they have wasn't bad enough, Jezebel influenced him to do even more wicked than he might have done on his own. And certainly, you see that very powerfully in

Unknown Speaker  24:51
this story. There was no one worse I think these two verses are put here because of the conclusion of this chapter. Starting in verse 27, it came about when Ahab heard these words, that he tore his clothes and put on sackcloth and fasted, and he lay in sackcloth and went about despondently. Then the word of the Lord came to Elijah the Tisch beit, saying, Do you see how Ahab is humbled himself before me, because he has humbled himself before me. I will not bring the evil in his days, but I will bring the evil upon his house and his son's days.

Unknown Speaker  25:49
Ahab repents he tore his clothes, put on sackcloth, fasted for the right reason, this time, laid in sackcloth and went about despondently. The words of God finally got through to Ahab's heart. Certainly this implies they have believed the words that his so called enemy, Elijah had told him, what does that tell you about how Ahab viewed Elijah? He knew whatever Elijah said, those were God's words. I believe I don't like him. But he's trustworthy. He is a true prophet. And his words said, my family is going to be no more and in a very powerful way. And he soften his heart. Now I love verse 28. Wouldn't you have loved to see Elijah's reaction? When God told him this message, then the word of the Lord came to Elijah, the Tish bite? Do you see our Ahab as humbled himself before me? Did you say Ahab? Are you sure? Ahab is the one you meant to say? He humbled Himself. And then God says, because he has humbled himself, because he has repented. I will not bring the evil in his days. God blesses Ahab. This is the same Ahab that's described in verses 25 and 26. This evil man with this evil wife, who work together against the Lord, who serve other gods. This needs to impress us on how loving our God is, and how much he is full of grace, even to people like Ahab and Jezebel. I want us to focus on three applications. I really have one, but I'll give you three because I'm supposed to give you three right?

Unknown Speaker  28:57
Well, the first two will be minor. I want us to notice the danger of coveting. From this story, the entire story happens because Ahab coveted and a boss vineyard

Unknown Speaker  29:14
may have wanted something that did not belong to Him. I don't think Ahab was in the wrong for asking neighbor to sell, or to to give him another vineyard in exchange for his own. But Ahab was in the wrong for wanting Naples vineyard to the point where he was all into it. That's the only thing you could focus on. And once that was no longer a possibility, in his mind. He was selling in vexed. I think there's a powerful lesson for me that I need to be extremely careful about coveting things. things that don't belong to me. Our attention and focus towards the things of this world can do us great harm. If we are not careful. We may spend extra time collecting a bigger paycheck to get something at the expense. With, with time with our family, converting the last things of his of this earth come with great expectation to make us happier, but so often fails and makes us become more greedy. And the sin of covetousness can happen to anybody. You say, Oh, sure, it makes sense that this wicked man, Ahab was covetous. But didn't the same thing happen in Second Samuel chapter 10 to righteous King David. This is a powerful sin, that we need to be making sure we stay away from the need to rebuke when it's appropriate if Jezebel had done the right thing, in rebuking Ahab's sin of coveting Naples vineyard, nabe off his sons would have stayed alive and no other sins would have been committed. Jezebel had the philosophy of if someone is not willing to give you what you want you to take it by force. Instead of rebuking Ahab and his attitude. Jezebel attacks Navy boss and gives really feeds into Ahab's covetousness. There are times when we need to rebuke sinful attitudes in one another. Jesus rebuked Peter for putting man's interest ahead of gods and Matthew 16, verse 23, when Peter said, by no means am I going to let you die. Paul rebuked Peter for withdrawing himself from the Gentiles. And he did that publicly. As described in Galatians, two verses 11 through 14. Peter rebuked Simon the sorcerer, for wanting to exchange the gift of God for money. Galatians six and verse one, says brethren, even if anyone is caught in any trespass, you who are spiritual restore such a one in a spirit of gentleness, each one looking to yourself so that you too, will not be tempted. I don't know about you, but rebuking someone is not one of my favorite things to do. I'm sometimes afraid well, how is how is he going to take it? Well, will he get angry with me? Well, he kind of shunned me. Well, we remain friends and I have all these stupid worries. Where I shouldn't be worried about if I let this continue. If I don't rebuke where's this gonna lead? And certainly as Galatians six verse one says, We need to restore such a one in a spirit of gentleness. But here's the main point where with God's love, and with God's grace, there is hope for anyone. If someone like Ahab, can humble himself due to God's words? I'll say anyone can. How many times? Do we write off someone and claim that there is just no use? They will never respond to the gospel.

Unknown Speaker  34:17
They are so wicked. There's just their heart is of stone, there's no way you can get through it. So we just kind of write them off. My guess is Elijah had written off a half years ago. Look, if Ahab is not going to see the mighty powerful God who sent fire from heaven to consume this sacrifice, there is no hope. This story should give us hope that anyone can turn to the Lord. It might take them several years. But we should never give up and it is our Are responsibility given by God to spread the gospel message to all men, even those we think would never respond to the gospel. One of the most amazing texts to me is Isaiah chapter six when we have the call of Isaiah, and in summarizing, God says, Isaiah, I want you to preach to these people. But I'm telling you right now, you're not going to convert a single one of them.

Unknown Speaker  35:37
But I want you to proclaim My message anyways. So what if we were we proclaim the Gospel? And the person we proclaim it to? does not respond? I think so

Unknown Speaker  35:55
many times people's Oh, what, what did I do wrong? Right? Where where? What did I say? Right, man, I messed up because they didn't respond. Who gives the increase? Right? God is the one that gives the increase. Let me ask Is God glorified?

Unknown Speaker  36:17
When you proclaim His message to someone? Absolutely. I don't know how many times and why just spoke to Ahab. But finally, he got through now did it make a permanent impression and was a have changed for the rest of his life? Well, he goes back to his old ways and a few verses right? In chapter 22. But the message to me is God's wants all men to be saved. And as Paul would say, I am the chief of sinners. And if God can forgive me, he can forgive anybody.

Unknown Speaker  37:13
There may be someone here tonight, who may have the attitude I've just I've sinned. Too much. I remember a story that my dad said about his, I guess it was his step grandma, his stepdads Mom,

Unknown Speaker  37:38
I don't I'm not good with family, however you want to do that. And she said, I've just lived so much of my life in sin, there's just no way. God can forgive someone like me. First Kings chapter 21 says God can do that. And God wants to do that. If there is anyone here tonight who needs to make their life right with God. We ask you to do that now as we stand and as we sing
