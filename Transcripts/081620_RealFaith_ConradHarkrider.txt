It's so good to see each of you here this morning. Appreciate the words that brother Swofford had for us for the Lord's Supper and the prayer that Lee LED and the songs that Nick led for us. And, again, it's just so good to be with you and to be able to see your faces and to worship God together. If you want to open up your Bibles to Luke, the 20th chapter where we had our scripture reading, that's where we're going to be studying the rest of our time this morning. Luke chapter 20.

Conrad Harkrider  00:43
A number of years ago, I was visiting New York City and we were walking down one of the streets and there was a man that came up and approached us, he was a vendor that was selling all different kinds of things. He came up and he asked us if we would be interested in buying a gift or a souvenir. And we came over to his little area that he had set up and he had different kinds of merchandise, and we were surprised to see things like a Louis Vuitton handbag, a pair of Oakley sunglasses, a Rolex watch, and a coach handbag. And what was even more surprising than the selection was the prices $20 for a designer handbag 15 for a new pair of sunglasses. We could hardly believe that this very nice and friendly and somewhat suspicious person in New York City was offering all of these great things at such a reduced price. How could he do that? Well, one possibility is they were stolen items. That's that's always a an option. But another potential answer for why he could be selling these things in this way was because they were not real. They were counterfeit, they were imposters you buy one of those, maybe you've had a similar experience. And after a couple of months, the seams start to come apart, the logo begins to fade away, because they are not real. In Luke chapter 20, Jesus teaches His disciples a very important lesson about what real genuine faith looks like. And in order to do this, Luke is going to present side by side accounts or comparisons, like a bank teller, who looks at the real version of the the currency and the fake. So Luke is going to present a version of fake of counterfeit faith and then present one beside it. That is genuine and real. Luke chapter 20. Look with me in verse 45. It says, Then, in the hearing of all the people, he said to his disciples, Beware of the scribes who desire to go around in long robes, who love greetings in the marketplaces, the best seats in the synagogues, and the best places at the feasts, who devour widows' houses and for a pretense make long prayers, these will receive greater condemnation. Jesus is going to draw the attention of his disciples and all the people into this question of what does real faith look like? What are the attributes and the characteristics of real faith? And what we see here, in this negative example is some things that are very surprising. Many of the qualities and attributes that were being displayed by these scribes and teachers are not the things that show or manifest real faith. The setting for these verses that we just read is in Jerusalem. This is the last week of the life of Jesus. And during this time, Jesus has not made for himself very many friends, at least not among the rulers. As he comes into the city. He goes into the temple and he clears out all those who are buying and selling, and he rebukes and answers and frustrates the leaders as they come to him and they ask questions. They go away feeling embarrassed and ashamed whether it was asking about his authority or the resurrection or paying taxes to Caesar. They always tried to come up with the perfect scenarios to try to try Jesus. But in every case, he was able to answer their questions. He also told a parable about a vineyard that was being managed. And he says it was being run by wicked tenants. And after he finishes the parable in Luke chapter 20, it says that the chief priests and the scribes knew verse 19, that he was talking about them. They understood that what he was saying was directed towards them, and they were enraged.

Conrad Harkrider  05:33
Luke does a good job of showing us the tension, the animosity, the feelings of anger, and jealousy that were brewing, leading up to the crucifixion of Jesus. Notice in verse 45, who Jesus is speaking to, in verse 45, it says, Then, in the hearing of all the people, he said to his disciples, he speaking to His disciples, but this is not a private lesson on the Sea of Galilee, because it says that this was said in the presence of all the people, this is a public open, warning in the presence of all in verse 46, he says, Be aware, be careful, be on your guard. Be watchful. We went to a friend's house, one time they live out in the country. And my friend was taking us down to see the creek that ran along their property. And as we were approaching, he looked at me and he said, watch out for water moccasins. And I looked at him and I kind of thought he was just trying to spook me. And I wanted to make sure that he was meant what he said, he said, No, really, I saw one the other day. And all of a sudden, I didn't feel like going down to the creek anymore. We offer warnings, when there is some type of danger when there is a threat that needs to be watched out for. But what's surprising here is notice what Jesus is warning his disciples about. He says in verse 46, be aware of the scribes on the surface, that doesn't make a whole lot of sense. Imagine you're a Jew living there in this time, and you're about to head out the door. And the last thing that mom says to you is watch out for those religious teachers and experts of the law. What are you talking about? Mom, I thought those are the people that you want me to be spending time with. And surely these teachers were well respected and revered by the people, they were held in his highest esteem and standing in the presence of all and notice some of the words that Jesus uses to describe them. He says that they wore robes. He says that they extended greetings in the mart marketplace. They were present at the synagogues. They took part in the Jewish feasts. And they made long prayers. These are well dressed corrigible people who are attending all of the religious gatherings and they're offering up prayer to God, why would Jesus warn his disciples? And why would he warn all of us about getting too close to these people or worse, to become like one of them? First of all, we see that their faith in God was something that was fake. It wasn't real. Because they were focused on appearance. The tech shows us that they were concerned they were emphasizing the physical. The things that people could see it says in verse 46, that they have long robes. This is a elaborate it's extravagant type of dress. In Matthew 23. In verse five, it says, speaking about the Pharisees, they do all of these deeds. They do all of their deeds to be seen by others, for they make their phylacteries broad and their fringes long a phylactery was a little box made covered in leather, that they would attach to their forehead and they would put little pieces of Scripture inside of the box, supposed to be a symbol of having God's Word on your mind in between your eyes, but in reality, it was just something that was visible, something that other people would see and take notice of. And so was that all of the things that they did They expanded the fringes on on their garments and their tassels. This was all done to draw attention to themselves. It wasn't just in their dress in verse 47. It says that for pretense, they make long prayers. In other words, they just kept praying and praying and praying so that other people would see would notice.

Conrad Harkrider  10:28
When I was younger, when I was young, we had an older man in our congregation, that every time he got up to say a prayer on Sunday morning, it felt like at minimum, it was at least 15 minutes long. And I remember thinking as kids, we always hoped that that meant the sermon would be shorter, but it never worked out that way. Jesus was not saying that it's wrong to wear nice clothes. He's not condemning long prayers. In fact, Jesus prayed all night and encouraged his disciples to do the same when he was in the garden. But when our dress or our jewelry or our actions become motivated by by a desire to be seen, and noticed by others, instead of trying to please the Lord, then we've missed the point. If the prayers that we say in front of others, are always longer and more eloquent than the ones we say in private, that we need to take a step back, we need to take a look at that. and examine our motivations. These scribes and Pharisees were focused on form over substance, they were concerned about the physical, ignore the chapter break here in chapter 21. But look at verse five. As Luke continues, highlighting this attitude in verse five, he says, Then, as some spoke of the temple, how it was adorned with beautiful stones, and decorations. Look at this beautiful temple. It's got all of these precious stones, it's so marvelous to look at. And it was a spectacular structure, even by modern standards. But Jesus highlights their inconsistency. They're so impressed with how beautiful this building is, but where were they getting all the money? Where were they getting those donations? It says that they were exploiting widows. Earlier in the gospel, we hear about how they were buying and selling and trading inside the temple courts. And so they were more focused on expanding the Treasury, and the outward appearance of the building than they were with what was actually going on in the temple, the worship, the praise of God. This is why in Matthew chapter 23, and verse 27, Jesus compares them to whitewashed tombs. He says that Outwardly they were appearing to be beautiful structures, but inside full of dead men's bones. What does Jesus tell them is going to happen to these beautiful stones? Look at verse six. He says these things which you see, the days will come in which not one stone will be left upon another. All of these things are going to be destroyed. And so where you're putting your emphasis, your focus your attention, these things are temporary. How much time do we spend on the physical? How much time do we spend building, the physical adorning the external, whether that be the physical place where we worship, or the clothes that we put on when we come into God's presence? Is the focus on is it solely on what others see? Or is there something deeper? Is there something that is more lasting, more meaningful? They were focused on appearance second there. Secondly, their faith in God was fake because they were concerned with status.

Conrad Harkrider  14:34
Verse 46, says that they loved the greetings in the marketplace. When they went into the market. They wanted to be admired and respected by others. They cared about titles and recognition. It says that they when when they went into the synagogues, they wanted to have the best seat not because they were interested in hearing the Word of God and being up Close and listening to the Scripture, but rather they wanted a place that would be viewed by all who were there. In Luke chapter 14, Jesus told a parable about a wedding feast to his disciples. And he said that when you go into the wedding feast, don't choose the most honorable or, or distinguished seat. Because if you do, the host may come in, and there may be another guest who is more honored than you. And he may ask you to move down to a different spot. And then you'll be ashamed and humiliated. But Jesus said, instead, choose the lowest spot, choose a place of humility, and so that when the host comes in, he'll invite you to move up to a better place. What we see in the scribes and Pharisees is that they were all about asserting their own position. staking out their claims, they wanted others to know how important they were, that they had a special place of significance and importance. When we were growing up, we're always in competition with my brothers. It was always a competition about who could be first. I was the first one to brush my teeth. I was the first one to finish my plate, I was the first one to touch the car. Somehow, we never had a competition about the first one getting into bed and going to sleep. That was never a prize that anybody wanted. But we wanted to be able to say that I was first. As adults, do we find ourselves falling back into that childish mindset. We want to be first, we want to be the best. And not just be the best, but we want others to know where we're at. And we slip into a mindset where we help someone out not necessarily because we're interested in helping, but we want others to see us as helpful. We offered a teacher class not because we want to teach young people but because we want to be known as a teacher, we become concerned with what is the perception? What do people think about me. And we're focused on status and position in Luke chapter 10, when Jesus sent out the 72, to go into preach and to heal, when they returned back to him. They were overcome with joy. And they said, even the demons are subject to us. They've had all this success. And you remember what Jesus told them? In Luke chapter 10, and verse 20. He said, nevertheless, do not rejoice in this, that the spirits are subject to you, but rejoice that your names are written in heaven. The title, the position, the honor, that we should be striving to receive is that our names would be written in heaven. These people were concerned with their status. We also see that their faith was not real because they were motivated by greed. In verse 47, it says that they would devour widows' houses. They were pretending to be righteous people to be leaders of the nation of Israel, but all the while they were preying on the people who are most vulnerable. Throughout Scripture, widows have been mentioned as a group that are at risk, they are alone. And because of their situation, these so called Teachers were taking advantage of this tragic situation. A woman who has come upon hardship, and they were using that for their own selfish benefit. Whether it was some type of deception, or if they were coercing them or just outright threatening these people. They were exploiting them all because of a desire for money. In Luke chapter 16, in verse 13,

Conrad Harkrider  19:28
Jesus warns about the danger of serving money. He says, No serving can serve two masters for either he will hate the one and love the other, or he will be devoted to the one and despise the other. You cannot serve God and money. The Pharisees who were lovers of money, heard all these things and they ridiculed him. These people hated what Jesus had to say. Because the text says that they were lovers of money. Their desire for things had blinded them. And it caused them to start taking advantage of the weakest among them. They cared more about things about money than they did about people. We took one of our girls to a birthday party. And one of the activities that they had planned was something that I always loved as a kid. It was to hit the pinata. Now, sometimes they make those things almost indestructible. The adult can't even rip, rip them apart. But you know how it works. Once it breaks open all of the candy falls out on the floor and that it is a mad dash a rush to collect as much as you possibly can. You think about our approach to material things. Are we in a mode of rushing to acquire and accumulate as much as we possibly can? When kids are going for candy, they can't hear anything else. They're not paying attention to the person beside them. They're not listening to the parent who's yelling at them. It is all about the prize. And so it is with us when we make wealth our greatest priority. It's almost as if we'll stop at nothing to gain more. You say Well, I would never take advantage of a widow I have seen people drain their elderly parents life savings, because of an insatiable appetite for more. So the warning is that we need to love people and use money. And when we get that flipped around, and we begin to love money and use people we find ourselves practicing a worthless religion. This was counterfeit, it was fake because they were motivated by greed. Compare this to the woman that Luke highlights in chapter 21, a real and genuine faith. In verse one, it says Luke 21 one and he looked up and he saw the rich putting in their gifts into the treasury and he saw also a certain poor widow putting into mites. First of all, we see that genuine faith is a faith that displays humility. This woman was a nobody. We're not even told her name. We know nothing about her. She received no recognition or honor for what she did. People who would have seen what she was putting in would have scoffed at her two mites to copper coins. This was the smallest currency the smallest coin in their currency. A might or a copper coin would have been 1/100 of a denarius. a denarius was a day's wage. So a very small amount anybody have any type of means would have seen this as petty and insignificant. Especially when you compare that to what other people were putting in. Jesus says that the rich were cut, or Luke says that the rich were coming in offering their very large gifts. But despite her low standing, despite her position and her status, her limited funds that doesn't stop her. It doesn't prevent her from coming and making an offering she displays humility. She is humbled to make a contribution. Even when there is no recognition, admiration or praise that's offered. No one seems to take notice except of course, for Jesus. When we make an offering or when we help someone who is in need. Jesus warns in the sermon on the mount that we should not blow a trumpet

Conrad Harkrider  24:27
that we should not sound the alarm so that everyone will see and know about what we're doing. But instead he says that it should be as if our left hand doesn't know what the right hand is about to do. Think about it if the Lord is the only one who sees us give. If he is the only one who knows about it, then we're giving him the same spirit as this woman. Our motivation should not come from a desire to lift ourselves up. But instead we give because we've been blessed, we see it as an opportunity to share, to help to support not as a way to lift up or promote or to gain recognition for ourselves. Jesus said that if we want to be great, if we want to become great in his kingdom, we have to become the servant or the slave of all. And it's in service, that we are transformed to be like our Lord. This woman displayed great humility. Next, we see that genuine faith, it exhibits trust. It exhibits trust, you think about this woman's current situation, she's in no position to be giving anything to anyone else. She is financially destitute, she has lost her husband, how can she possibly make an offering to God, she has nothing to offer and are very little. And yet we see her display this unwavering trust, this faith that says I am going to give to God, I'm going to do what's most important. And yet trust that the Lord will take care of me. Faith means putting God first even when it doesn't make sense. Faith means continuing to serve God, even when it's difficult when there are setbacks. When there's challenges, you remember what happened to Joseph, he refused to give in to Potter for his wife's requests. And where did that land him? He ended up in the dungeon, so much for following God's path. But Joseph didn't give up on the Lord. He didn't turn his back on God, because he knew that the Lord would continue to be with him that God was going to carry him through that this was just a season, a period of time that wouldn't last forever. And so Joseph kept his perspective. And that allowed him to continue to trust to keep his faith in God. When you're driving down the road, and the GPS tells you to turn left, what do you do? Well, if you are listening, you turn left, otherwise, you keep going, and you got to make a U turn. But when it tells you to take the exit, what do you do? You take the exit? Why do we listen to these little machines and what they tell us to do? Sometimes we're driving in a place that we've never even been before. And yet we still follow their guidance. Why do we do that? Because we trust them. We believe that what they're telling us is true, that they're taking us to the right place to the correct destination. And when it comes to navigating this life and living in this world, we don't have all the answers. We don't know what's up ahead. But following God's ways, doing the right thing is always the right decision. God's Word is a light. It's something that guides us It provides clarity, and visibility in this world. And when we seek after him, we can have confidence that will end up in the right place. This this poor widow didn't know what was coming down the road. She didn't know what was going to happen in the future. But she knew the right thing to do was to continue to serve and be generous and give to God. Finally, real faith, genuine faith is one that shows generosity. In verse three, it says so he said, Truly I say to you that this poor widow has put in more than all for these all out of their abundance have put in offerings, but she out of her poverty put in all the livelihood that she had. Jesus gives us a little bit more information about what's going on here something that everyday observers would not have seen. And that is that she has offered more than anyone else that day. Not Of course, in the actual amount, which was very small. But Jesus tells us that she put in her entire livelihood. I think it's interesting that there was two coins.

Conrad Harkrider  29:23
She could have, she did have something to hold back. She could have just set in one coin and kept one for herself. But it goes back to the trust thing she trusted that God would provide for her she was generous. And that's what we see in true faith. True Faith is not bound by a love for things. But instead is willing to part with possessions and with money when there's opportunity. Faith is storing up treasures for the life to come. Not just for The last couple of decades that we're going to be here on this earth. Faith is something that has moved to action. It's more than just good feelings. It's more than good intentions. It's more than thoughts of kindness and positive feelings. Faith is actually taking the step, to let go of something and to make that offering to God. There will always be needs among us. For as long as the Earth exists, there will be people who are in need. Jesus said, the poor you have with you always. But true faith is displayed by those who despite the difficulties, the challenges that they may be facing themselves, they're willing to make an offering, to live generously and to give to the Lord. And not just so that the church has more money. But it is a spirit, it's an attitude. It's a way of law of life, that we are constantly seeking for ways to give back to the Lord and to others because of all the rich blessings that God has given to us. Do we see the difference in these two types of faith? One that is just a hypocrite, an act or an imposter and the other that is genuine, sincere and real. We're going to close this morning with an invitation. It's an opportunity for each one of us to think about our walk, our standing our position before God if there's something that we can do to help encourage you or support you. In your connection to the Lord. We want to make that opportunity available. Please come down to the front as we stand in scene
