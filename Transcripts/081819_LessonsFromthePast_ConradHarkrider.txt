It's good. Good to see each of you here tonight, if you want to open your Bibles to Matthew, the 24th chapter. Matthew 24. Jeremy started his lesson this morning talking about how much he appreciates his wife for all that she does to help him get ready when he's going to speak. And I echo that same sentiment, especially since my wife has been writing my sermons for me for the past three or four years. Now, she does do a lot to help me get ready and with the kids, and it's always good to have people that we can talk to about spiritual things, bounce ideas off of ask questions, what do you think about this. And so hopefully, that's one of the benefits of coming together in a group like this is where we can share thoughts, ideas, questions, and grow in our faith together. When I was in college, my family took a trip to Washington, DC. And it was my first time to visit if you've ever been to DC, you know that one of the great things about it is they have all these different museums that you can go and see the Air and Space Museum, the National Archives, the natural history, American history, the Holocaust Museum, and one of the things that I quickly learned during our trip was that there are different types of museum goers. That is different ways of going through a museum and it can make for an interesting family vacation, depending on people's level of interest. In looking at the exhibits, for example, you have some people who like to walk through a museum at what I would call a normal pace, every now and then they'll stop and look at something but they can usually knock one of those out in about 45 minutes to an hour. Then you have other people who like to stop and look at every single display and not just look, but they want to read the whole paragraph about this guy's coat and where it used to be and what happened to it. And they can usually get through a museum in about four to six hours. And to be honest, I'm actually in that second category. I love learning about history. And so when we were on our trip, my dad and brother would be sitting at the exit kind of waiting for us to make our way through so that we could go on to see the next site. But history is not only interesting, it is important. Solomon said that there's nothing new that's under the sun. And history is bound to repeat itself. And so there's a lot of lessons that we can learn about the past that help give us insight into what's going on today. What's happening in the president. So I want to look at an event from history tonight, this lesson is going to be a little different is we're not going to start with a text and kind of work our way through it. But instead we're going to talk about this event. And then we'll conclude the lesson with some of the things that we can learn the applications that come out of it.

Conrad Harkrider  03:23
So think with me tonight about a lesson from the past, as we talk about the Bar Kochba revolt. But before we get into that, look, look with me in Matthew chapter 24, beginning in verse 23, Matthew 24 and verse 23. It says, If anyone says to you look, here is the Christ or there do not believe it. For false christs and false prophets will rise and show great signs and wonders to deceive, if possible, even the elect. See, I have told you beforehand. As Jesus was approaching the end of his ministry on earth, he spoke a number of prophecies and warnings about things that were going to happen in the end times. Matthew 24. And 25 is filled with prophetic language about the events that were about to take place. And Jesus says here in chapter 24, verse 23, that there are going to be some people who come that claim to be the Christ, they are claiming to be something great, but in actuality, they are imposters. They would be influential and persuasive and they would lead many people to follow them. But Jesus says don't believe it. He didn't want his people to get caught up in some of these movements that were going to take place when Jesus came to the people to the Jewish nation. He was the Messiah, but he didn't just claim seemed to be that he demonstrated it through his power. He demonstrated it through His miracles, being able to heal people raise people from the dead. He showed it in his teaching, he displayed God's wisdom every time he spoke, and the people understood that this was no ordinary teacher that they were listening to. And so there was a clear distinction or difference between what Jesus brought and his ministry. And what many of these imitators or false Christs would bring, they were often engaged in things that were self seeking, they were promoting themselves, they would talk about some great thing that they could do or were going to do, but then they would wouldn't back it up. But we see Jesus was real and genuine. And that's why his followers were willing to follow him at all costs. Well, before we get into the bar, Kochba revolt, I wanted to just set the stage of where this occurs in history, it happened in the year 132 ad. So you remember that Jesus's life was around AD 32, ad 33, when he was crucified. And

Conrad Harkrider  06:19
so most people think, or many people think that Matthew was written about 20 to 30 years after that time around at 50, to 60. So the things that Matthew was saying in chapter 24, would have been leading up or preparing people for the destruction of the temple, which happened in 8070, when Titus, the Roman General came, destroyed the temple and all of Jerusalem. There's some others that also think that Matthew could have been written at a later date in 80, to 90. And when you talk about dating these letters, it's not a perfect science they didn't write. Today's date is at the start of the letter, there's no copyright. And there's a number of ways that scholars will look at to try to figure out when something was written, but I'll give you just a couple of ceilings that can be used. The first is the person's death, the writing has to occur before that time. And then also, when do people start quoting from the work. And so in Matthews case, the early church fathers start to record or write from Matthew, writing quotes from Matthew's Gospel in the 90s. So we know that it's written some time before that, but whether it was written in the 50s, or 60s or 80s, or 90s. If it has a later date, then maybe some of the things that Matthew is saying here, are trying to help prepare people for what would happen in 132, which many of the same things that happened in at 70. But regardless, Christ's intention or His purpose is to help prepare his disciples. He wants them to be aware, he wants them to be vigilant, he wants to be watchful, for the things that are about to take place. And he doesn't want them for these things to come upon them as a surprise. So what is the Bar Kochba revolt? Well, after the destruction of the temple, in 8070, the Jews were still allowed to live in Judea, they were allowed to stay in the land, their religious and political structure had changed drastically. So the temple was gone, there was no more sacrifice, people could no longer go there to worship, the ruling groups like the Sanhedrin, and the Pharisees and the Sadducees. All that got up ended when the temple was destroyed, but the people were still living in the land. And so in 118, ad Hadrian becomes the Roman emperor, and initially he is receptive are he is open minded towards the Jewish people. He even considers the idea of reestablishing Jerusalem and and allowing them to rebuild their temple. This was a holy place to them, it was it was important to their faith. And so he was considering these things, but that quickly turned in the opposite direction, as Hadrian begins to make some edicts that negatively impact the Jewish people, and the first one was a prohibition of castration. And it wasn't directed specifically at the Jews, but when they worded this document, it included circumcision. And so you can imagine if that practice was outlawed, it was punishable by death, how that would impact the Jews. The second was that Hadrian wanted to rebuild Jerusalem and have it become a Roman city named Alia Capitolina. But he also wanted to put a temple in the city on the same To location as the Jewish temple instead. But instead, this temple would be dedicated to the Greek god Zeus. And so, at that point, the Jews decided that

Conrad Harkrider  10:16
this was not going to work for them, obviously. And so they started making preparations for a result of revolt. They start amassing supplies, they get weapons, they're making plans. They were methodical in their planning, they had learned a number of lessons from what had happened in 8070. And so this time, they strategically planned out how they wanted this to go down. They built a system of caves and hideouts underneath the cities where they could track where they could get from place to place or hide supplies or people and make it very difficult for the Romans to fight with them. A leader ammos arose among the people by the name of Simon Ben ko Seba, and he was a strict and hardened military leader. But because of some of his early successes that he had, he was eventually designated by many of the rabbis or at least one prominent rabbi, as the Messiah. And there's a passage in Numbers chapter 24, and verse 17. It says, I see him but not now. I behold him but not near a star shall come out of Jacob and a sceptre shall rise out of Israel, it shall crushed the forehead of Moab and break down all the sons of Sheth. So this prophecy about a star coming out of Jacob was assigned or attributed to this man, Simon bin Koshiba and his name he was given the title of Bar Kochba, which means son of a star. And so you can see he's leading the people. He's having these military explorations, he's had some success. And now this title has been given to him. And all of a sudden the the national fervor the Messianic excitement begins to just explode among the people more and more are coming to join the effort to fight off the Romans, Bar Kochba was immensely successful. Under his leadership, the Jewish fighters had over 200,000 strong, they amassed a huge fighting force. And they engaged in a guerrilla style warfare when they would go down and attack a Legion or a Roman garrison, and then they would retreat back up into the hills for safe for safety. But during this time, they're able to capture 50 strongholds and 985 towns and villages. This next map here shows you the region that was under their control at the height of their success, the blue area, there is what they were now controlling. They were also able to completely wipe out several Roman legions, they destroyed them completely. They then every single fighter or soldier in the in the Legion was killed. And so from this time, they're able for about two and a half years, they essentially have independence from Rome, they are operating under their own system, they they begin to print and make their own coins. The coin on the left there is a an image of the Jewish temple with a rising star at the top. And then the one on the right has the inscription it says to the freedom of Jerusalem. So the excitement and the optimism is at an all time high, the Messiah has come the enemy has been pushed out. We now have this independence that we've longed for for so long. And then they are now making plans to potentially Rebuild God's temple and restore the worship to God. It sounds very similar to the days of Nehemiah, or maybe King David where the people were able to push off the oppressors and now they could come in and fulfill God's purpose. But the independence and the success under Bar Kochba was short lived as Roman emperors don't take rebellions lightly. Hadrian called for reinforcements, and he brought one of his most trusted generals down from Britain or Europe at the time was where he was stationed. He brought him down to Judea and also called for several legions from Europe to come down and to help fight. And so they began to systematically go through and capture town by town, city by city. And just to wipe out and destroy all the places that had been held the territory that had been held by Barkada, and his men.

Conrad Harkrider  15:21
And so the aftermath of this revolt, 50 strongholds, and 985 towns and villages are destroyed. So everything that they were able to take is ultimately wiped out 580,000 casualties from the the war itself, and then also countless others that were that ended up dying because as a result of famine and disease, and then the Hadrian, the Roman Emperor renames, the area to Syria, Palestinian, which is where we get the name Palestine, before he really wanted to change the identity of the land. And not only did he rename it, but he completely removed all of the people that were living there. Now, they went through the surrounding areas after Barkoff, Bowen, and his men had been put down, they didn't just stop there, the surrender wasn't sufficient. They then went through all of the cities and surrounding towns and systematically wiped out and executed all of the people that were living there. And so the result of this is that Judea would not become a Jewish center of culture and a thought and idea until the modern era until 1948, when it was established as a nation. So the Jews are dispersed from Judea, and sent off into other places, the ones that survived. So what about the impact and the result of this, the center of Jewish life for 1000s of years had been Jerusalem, but now it moves north to the area of Galilee. That's where the most prominent rabbis and synagogues were located. This This event also solidified the distinction between Christians and Jews. People who were of Jewish descent that followed, Christ now saw themselves as as different there was a distinction between them and the Jews. Because this was a dividing line, you either stood with this military leader Bar Kochba, or you, you defected, and in many times the Christians were were persecuted or put to death for their unwillingness to follow. And it really ended a time of Jewish nationalism. The Jewish belief system really pivoted from this point, the rabbi's realized that if Judaism was going to survive, it had to be on based upon something other than violent revolts, and trying to fight wars and battles against nations, they were going to have to do it through the synagogue and through teaching in the law. And so there was a lot of emphasis on learning and instruction, as opposed to taking up armed resistance against whatever nation they were living in. So what are some of the lessons that we can learn from this event? That's what I want to spend the rest of our time on this evening? Well, if you'll turn back in the book of Matthew to chapter two, verse four, Matthew 24, in verse four, and read with me, they're

Conrad Harkrider  18:41
in the same section about Jesus giving these prophecies he says in Matthew 24, in verse four, Jesus answered and said to them, Take heed that no one deceives you, for many will come in My name, saying, I am the Christ, and will deceive many. And you will hear of wars and rumors of wars, see that you are not troubled for all these things must come to pass. But the end is not yet for Nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom and there will be famines, pestilences, and earthquakes in various places. All these things are the beginning of sorrows. First of all, we see from this event, that false teaching is devastating false teaching can have a extremely detrimental and devastating effect. Here, Jesus in Matthew 24, he says that people are going to be led astray, that the power of this false teaching the power of this idea or this, this thought, is going to lead people away from God. And we see this in the Jewish nation there is this all out revolt, the entire nation comes together, trying to resist is just the most powerful nation in all of the world and possibly even all of human history. They are convinced that they need to go into this revolt, because there is a prophecy that is falsely assigned to this man, and they are led to believe that he will lead them to victory. And so you see the effects of that people are now making decisions, they are buying into something that just wasn't true. We know in the time of King David, he would often inquire of God, he would ask the question, shall I go up? Do you want me to take this city? Or do you want me to go in to this, this battle, and the Lord would respond to him and give him guidance and insight. Now, things were different during this time period for for God's people they didn't, as far as we know, have direct access to God's will through through prophets in the same way. But it does beg the question, Did anyone ask the question? Should we be doing this? Should we fight the Romans? Is this the right thing to do? Does God want us to rebuild his temple. And apparently they hadn't learned the lesson from what happened in 8070. Because this second defeat would be far more severe than the first. And so as we think about our own lives, it's critical for us to consider and think about the things that we believe the things that we follow the lessons that guide our lives, that order our steps. If people start to blindly follow some type of allegiance, whether that's a influential person, a church, a nation, an ideology, a preacher, a priest, whatever it may be, without carefully considering the path that they're on. That course that direction often leads to a place that's far away from God. So the point that we need to see is that we can't just rely on what our our parents told us what are our teachers might have said, what we might have learned when we were growing up, or we can't rely on what a person says no matter how well meaning they might be, it's important for us, each one of us to open our eyes, and to think for ourselves. The I was thinking about the Samaritan woman. And when Jesus went to Samaria, he didn't just go into the city and say, I need to meet with the leaders of the city, I need to meet with the most influential men of the town. And I need to share with you this message and teach you and then you can tell it to everyone else. Now he goes in and he meets with a woman by the well. And I think what we see from that is Jesus was concerned about individuals, he wanted each person to understand to know who the Messiah was, and for that belief, for that conviction to be their own, to be seated in their hearts. And so it is today God wants each person to know what they believe why they believe it, so that they can defend their faith and also proclaim and stand up for their faith.

Conrad Harkrider  23:35
And so false teaching can be a danger, even to us today. Some of the fewer examples of of things that can lead people astray. I think one of the things that made bar COC buzz rebellion, so appealing is because it fit into what the Jewish people wanted to see in a leader. It played into their desire, they were looking for someone who is strong, who is out in front of the people who was leading great charges down into the valley and coming up with these wonderful victories, and that fit into their desire, what they were looking for. And the same can happen today with with teaching or with doctrine. God just wants people to be happy as long as a person, if it's good for them, or it's something that they like or that they want, then then it's okay. Or it doesn't really matter what you believe, as long as we love God, then then he's going to accept us and love is generally used in a very loose and vague term. Or what about this one? As long as I go to church, then God is going to be pleased. And we start to tell ourselves or make ourselves feel comfortable with something that maybe we've created or someone else has told us. But the problem with believing or Following a doctrine that isn't from God is that it gives us a false sense of security. And like with these people, they thought there was hope. They thought there was optimism, they thought there was something to look forward to. When in reality, there was great destruction that was all around there was this impending doom that was about to come upon them, they were in a very vulnerable situation. If you go to sleep at night, and there is a gas leak, or if there is smoke that starts coming into your house, what do you want those little sensors on the wall or up on the ceiling to do? Do you want them to wake you up? Do you want them to make noise to alert you a few months ago, we had a couple that sensors that kept going off every time that someone would take a hot shower in the guest bathroom. And my wife asked me if we were going to replace them. And I said, No, we're just going to ask people to stop taking showers, when they come visit with us. That's a case where they were malfunctioning. But if it is a real emergency, what do you want that sensor to do? What if it's inconvenient, what if it's loud, or at times, it's it's piercing, but we want it to wake us up. We want it to stir action or to cause us to do something because that warning can ultimately save our life. You know God's Word works in a similar way, and that it calls out it cries out it pierces into the hearts and the souls of people. God's Word is a lamp, it's a light to our path. Psalm 119, verse 105, says Your word is a lamp to my feet, and a light to my path. We have this incredible blessing in God's word. And that's why it's so important. We talk about daily Bible reading about studying God's word, reading it, discussing it, listening to it, because it helps give us that insight into what is God's will? How does God want his people to live? God's Word is truth that brings people out of sin and into a relationship with Him. And so we need to take advantage of that. And it allows us to be aware of some of the false teaching that can be so destructive that's here in the world today. Secondly, we see that God's kingdom is not of this world. This point really comes out when you when you talk about the Jews trying to amass armies, building up supplies, training their men, coming up with strategies and trying to take over or push out the Romans. And ultimately, this plan fails. And we see that God's purpose His intention was not for his kingdom, to last forever on Earth. God's kingdom is not of this world. In John chapter 18 And verse 36, as Jesus is being questioned by Pilate about who are you, why are you here? Why

Conrad Harkrider  28:22
are they accusing you of these things? He says, My kingdom is not of this world. If my kingdom were of this world, my servants would have been fighting that I might not be delivered over to the Jews. But my kingdom is not from this world. Jeremy talked about how, at the Lord's Supper this morning, how Jesus could have changed the events of what was happening to him. He didn't have to go to the cross. He could have had servants and well trained warriors that defended him that didn't allow him to go and be persecuted. But that wasn't God's will. God's Kingdom is spiritual. In Daniel chapter two. You remember the dream to Nebuchadnezzar about the statue made of different precious metals, and the last kingdom that comes and destroys that that statue is one that is greater than all the other kingdoms on earth. And Daniel says that this is a kingdom that will never be shaken. It will never be taken away. It's going to stand forever. That is a spiritual kingdom that God has established. The Jews wanted a, a physical kingdom. They wanted a kit leader to stand in front of them. They wanted to be able to mint coins and have a government here on earth. And the same thing can happen today with God's people. We think about the purpose of the church, what is the church's role and mission and what is the church trying to accomplish in the world today? Church is not a set of physical structures. It's not a building a location, a place. It's not a hierarchy of different responsibilities with one person who sits on top and orchestrates or manages all the operations. Jesus is the head of the church. And instead, the church is not some type of organization or structure, but yet it is made up of people. The church is just a group or a body of people that are connected to God through Christ, and are also connected to one another. They're seeking to help and devote themselves to one another. The fact that the kingdom is not in this world also fits with the message of the gospel. What was the the central theme of the gospel when they would go and teach people? What were they trying to tell them? The good news about Jesus Christ, it was bringing people out of a life of sin and restoring them to a relationship with God. In First Timothy chapter one and verse 15. It says, The saying is trustworthy and deserving of full acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners, of whom I am the foremost, why did Jesus come into the world? What does Paul say? Was it to eliminate poverty? Was it to get rid of disease? Was it to establish a better education system? Was it to give people clean water, all of those things are important. And many of them are necessary for people to be able to live productive lives. But when we think about the purpose and the mission of the church, does it center around things that are physical? Or is it focused on something that is spiritual? If you had a problem with your washing machine at the house, and at our house, the washing machine runs like the air conditioner. It's like It's always somebody is always doing laundry. But if you had a problem with that, and you call the repairman, he came over to your house. And when he got there, you found him out in the flowerbed. And he was pulling weeds. And after a while, he came to the front door. And he said, Well, if I finished my work, I waited your entire flower bed for you. What would you be thinking? That was nice of you. But the washing machine is still having a problem. The flower bed is a nice to have, but the washing machine is that was the central issue. That was the main thing that was affecting us. The reason why we called you that when the church makes its mission, to make the world a better place in a physical sense. It's losing sight of its primary function.

Conrad Harkrider  33:04
Jesus Christ came into the world to save sinners, that's what he was about. And so it is that the church should make that its focus today as well. So the kingdom is not of this world. It's not a physical kingdom, amassing some type of wealth or power or influence in a physical sense, but rather, helping save people's souls and drawing them closer to God. And finally, from this, the last point that we'll notice tonight, is that God is faithful to His word. Throughout time, God has made a number of prophecies. He has foretold events. He has said things through His messengers, and God is true to his word. He keeps his word the things that he says, will ultimately come to pass in Luke chapter 19 And verse 41. It says that when he drew near and saw the city, he wept over it. This is speaking of Jesus, and as he comes into Jerusalem, he begins to weep. And he says, would that you even you had known on this day the things that make for peace, but now they're hidden from your eyes for the days will come upon you when your enemies will set up a barricade around you and surround you and the hem, hem you in on every side and tear you down to the ground, you and your children within you. And they will not leave one stone upon another in you because you did not know the time of your visitation. When Hadrian ultimately destroys Jerusalem, Jerusalem, and expels all of the people out from the land. It was said that they took a ox cart or a yoke of not an ox car but a yoke of oxen, and they literally plowed through Jerusalem total and utter destruction, there was nothing that remained there. And so from that we see that God's promises God's God's words are true and faithful. And there's one side of that that can be very terrifying, right? God is said that one day, he's going to judge the world, that each person is going to stand in God's presence and given account for the things that we've done in this life, whether good or evil, one day all of us are are going to answer to the Lord. And that can be a terrifying thought. But there's another side of this, that God is faithful to His word that brings great comfort. There was a lot of Christians that were impacted by this revolt, there was Christians that were persecuted that were put to death because they wouldn't join in. There was Christians that were persecuted by the Romans. And even today, there are Christians that are subjected to violence because of their faith in Christ. But the thing that these people could hold to the words of Christ, and the thing that God's people today can hold to is the fact that one day God will deliver his people that God has promised, an eternal reward, that he will one day offer eternal life to the people who are faithful to Him that continue to follow him. Despite what happens in this life. We can trust that God will remain true and faithful to His word. In Revelation chapter two and verse 10, Jesus said, Be faithful unto death, and I will give you the crown of life. We're gonna close tonight with a song and it's an opportunity to encourage those who are here, if you haven't responded to the Gospel of Jesus Christ, Jesus said, He who believes and is baptized will be saved. And if you haven't obeyed the Lord and put on Christ in baptism, we want to we want to encourage you in that way. If there's something that we can do to help you in your walk with Christ, please come down to the front as together, we stand in scene
