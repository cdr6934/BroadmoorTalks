Good morning. Good to see everyone here today, it's certainly good that we have a chance to come here and worship God, we serve a good God. And it's always good to be reminded of that. Even over a few days, we tend to forget or get distracted from the simple truth of what God has done for us. So it's important that we assembled together and remind ourselves sing to one another, pray together. And remember the Lord's Supper. We have many guests that are here with us today, we appreciate the fact that you're here. Our goal at Broadmoor is to always give God praise and glory and all that we do. So we're glad that you're here with us, and we invite you back anytime you have an opportunity. I'll also begin with a slight personal comment here, I guess it's almost completely personal. But that's alright. So I've been I've been preaching and teaching and and this morning, I did double duty, which is fine. And a lot of times people will walk out the back and say we appreciate your lesson. But I wanted to stop for a second and thank my wife for what she does. So I tried to help my kids help get the kids ready. But I was useless this morning. I didn't contribute to that whatsoever. And she was like a boss took care of it, as she always does. So if you appreciate my words, anyway, you might want to thank her as well. And I'm sure Conrad could say the same and Mike could say the same and, and any of the men that that hear, speak or serve as elders. I appreciate her and I hope you do as well. So that's what I have to say about that. In First Samuel chapter 16, First Samuel chapter 16. We see the anointing of David. Now Saul had just been banished from being king. Now he would still serve out some of his reign, but in fact, he was stripped of the kingship when he violated God's command with the amla kinds. And he allowed a gag and others to live and he disobeyed God. Now he had some excuses for why that was take place, but pure and simple. It was disobedience in the sight of God. And God was not pleased with it. And he was stripped of his kingship. We see that Samuel went to to anoint the next king, and he was not exactly sure about who that would be. He comes to Jesse, and he goes to sacrifice one of his sons, and the first son that comes by his name is Elia Elia. And notice what it says in First Samuel 16 And verse six. When they came, he looked on Eliab, and thought, surely the Lord's anointed is before him. But the Lord said the same, you'll do not look on his appearance or on the height of his stature, because I have rejected him. For the Lord sees not as man sees Man looks on the outward appearance, but the Lord looks on the heart. You found that to be true.

Jeremy Sweets  03:04
I found that to be very true, there is a difference between how God sees things and how we see things. This morning, I'd like to spend just a few moments talking to you about the sin of prejudice, or partiality, as it's sometimes talked about in Scripture. And I think we see very clearly what the scripture has to say about why that takes place. And that takes place because we don't see things the way God does. You'll notice when he looked upon Eliab, he looked kingly. And there's a mention to the height of his stature. This one surely is the one that God is going to choose. And they must have all thought that. But there is a rebuke there that we shouldn't view people or judge people upon their outward appearance. It's sinful in the sight of God. And so we see this big distinction here, Man looks on the outward appearance, but the Lord looks on the heart. We're gonna talk about a few things involved with the sin of prejudice this morning. And our goal is to be able to develop a greater mindset like God, to be able to grow in our purity, to be able to grow in our heart, that would be an approach God's heart. So we want to look at things the way the Lord does. That's our goal. That's our goal. But sadly, that's not the reality is it all of the time. And so we need to be warned about that. Notice that first, the impartiality of God. This teaching is found all throughout scripture, and Deuteronomy chapter 10. And verses 17 and 18. There it says, For the Lord your God is God of gods and Lord of lords, the Great, the mighty and the awesome God, who is not partial and takes no bribe. He extends or executes justice for the fatherless and the widow and loves the sojourner giving food and clothing. God is not partial. He does not favor the wealthy, he has a heart for all people. And here he specifies those that are often left out of society, the sojourner, he says, the fatherless the widow, many people discount others because of the situation they find themselves in. But that's not what God does. Furthermore, God does not take a bribe. He cannot be persuaded to violate his character of love for all people. There's no amount of money that could make him to change or turn. Sadly, we're pretty fickle sometimes, aren't we? If someone disagrees with us, or looks down on us, or is offered a bit of money, maybe we could change what we do. But God is not like that. God takes no bra God is impartial. In Second Chronicles 19, verses six and seven. There it says that Jehoshaphat appointed judges and notice what he tells the people, he said to the judges, consider what you do for you judge not for man, but for the Lord. He is with you and giving judgments. Now then let the fear of the Lord be upon you. Be careful what you do. For there is no injustice with the Lord or God, or partiality or taking bribes. Judges could learn something by looking to God who is impartial campaign, certainly that was Jehoshaphat message. There is no partiality whatsoever with God. We see this also in the first part of Romans, All have sinned, and God is not going to be partial to any one person or nation. In Romans two and verse six, he will render to each one according to his works. In verse nine, there will be tribulation and distress for every human being who does evil, the Jew first and also the Greek, but glory and honor and peace. For every one who does good, the Jew first and also for the Greek, for God shows no partiality. God is not going to favor someone based upon their nationality or by what they look like. He says that the wicked will reap their consequences, the righteous will read their consequences. And what determines that is not how we look, or where we were born. What determines that is our actions, God will render based upon that, and it will be a righteous judgment. Notice with both of these, he adds the phrase to the Jew first, and also to the Greek, those that are wicked, it makes no difference. Whether you're a Jew or Greek, those that are righteous, it makes no difference, whether you're a Jew, or a Greek, God is righteous. And also in Acts chapter 10, as Peter was dealing with things that he had learned under the old law, he was taught and instructed that God wants all people to be saved, and he has to be a preacher of the gospel to all people. As he learned that lesson in Acts chapter 10, verses 34. And 35. Said, Peter opened his mouth and said, Truly I understand that God shows no partiality. But in every nation, anyone who fears him and does what is right, is acceptable to Him. In any nation. God is not partial. And so that's our starting place. And that's what we saw in First Samuel chapter 16, verse seven isn't, God is not partial. He doesn't look at things the way we do. He looks upon the heart, God is m partial. But sadly, we tend to be partial, don't we?

Jeremy Sweets  08:53
Let me count the ways that we judge people, the factors that go into our judgment, there are so many racism, of course, is a major factor in our country, a deep seated situation and still has effects today. But that's not the only way that prejudice occurs. It's certainly one though, and we need to consider that. But we judge people on many different factors in many different ways. Notice a few of these, first of all, on appearance now that's the one specified and in First Samuel chapter 16, verse seven, simply by the way someone looks and you might think this is a broad category, and it is. It is a broad category. In Proverbs 31, in verse 30, it says, Charm is deceitful and beauty is vain. But a woman who fears the Lord is to be prayed. Often, we may favor someone because they look nice, because they're attractive to us, and we may disregard someone else because they're not attractive. And so we often make judgments on petty, superficial thing. We see someone that looks nice to us. And we say that must be a good person. You know, there have been studies done, I don't have these numbers. But attractive waitresses get more tips and unattractive, not necessarily based upon their service, but by their looks. In many ways the world operates in that way. How you look is what is important. When you walk through the superstore or the grocery store supermarket. There's not a lot of tabloids that say, build a bare metal, build a better character in three days or less. You know, they don't say those things, do they? They talk about the bikini body and losing this weight and making sure you look fabulous in this or that way. The Bible, though, doesn't say, Build a Better Body, physically, in three days or less. That's not the focus of God, or the Scripture is it, but that tends to be our focus. So let us be careful of judging on appearances, just simply how people look. Sometimes we also judged on a age, we may discount someone because they are younger. After all, they couldn't possibly be able to do this, or that. But Paul told Timothy and First Timothy four and verse 12, Let no one despise you, for your youth, but set the believers and example in speech and conduct in love and faith and purity. Notice he doesn't say don't simply demand your rights. That's not the way to show yourself here. Young people are to do what older people do. And that is to set an example in godliness, and faithfulness. And so we shouldn't despise someone for their youth, nor should we despise someone for their age, which sometimes happen as well. This person is older, they are out of touch. They're they're no longer useful. Some might say, that's not how God sees things. And that's not how Christians should see things. Let us not despise others because of their age, but rejoice in the strengths of both youth and older a and appreciate those of all ages God does. God loved and loves the children. God loves the elderly, and everyone in between, there is no limit there to who God loves is there. Let us imitate him and not be partial based upon a age. We also may be partial or him partial to someone based upon simply where they're from their origin. And John one in verse 46. Nathaniel said, Can anything good come out of Nazareth? Can anything good come out of a place like that? You know, I've heard comments like that today. In the south, we like to joke amongst ourselves. And I've heard the same joke and insert state here right in Kentucky would tell about Tennessee, Tennessee tells about Kentucky or West Virginia and Mississippi. Some of that may be in good fun, but you also know some of that gets pretty serious. And sometimes we do discount people based upon where they're from. And it may be a state or it may be a nation. Mexicans aren't any good. They need to go back where they're from, I can hear people saying

Jeremy Sweets  13:37
based upon where they're from, we discount them as humans why? Why would we do that? And you could go down the list or it may be based upon the type of situation in your own hometown that you would come from this person from the projects, let us discount them. This person they grew up in, in the rich part of town. They're a trust fund kid. We don't have anything to do with them. And so we're partial based upon where people are from their origin. We also see this and Leviticus chapter 19, verses 33 and 34. And they are the origin is any foreigner. So anyone that would come among us that is not from here. Many people will mistreat, but that's not what God wanted. He says, When a stranger sojourns with you and your land, you shall not do him wrong. You shall treat the stranger who sojourns with you as the native among you, and you shall love him as yourself. For you were strangers in the land of Egypt, I am the Lord your God. We are not to despise the sojourner or the stranger among us. But sadly, that's what the partiality of man does. Furthermore, we see in scriptures that were there are instances or cases where people were discounted, or despise Eyes are looked down upon because of the race or nationality. In John chapter four and verse nine, it has this parenthetical statement for Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans. Jews didn't want to have anything to do with a Samaritan because of the race. That happens today, doesn't it? Because of someone's race, someone will be partial, say, I don't have anything to do with this person. Or because of their nationality. I don't want to have anything to do with this person. Or they may talk bad about or despise or look down upon someone. Because of these factors. The reason that parenthetical statement is is made is because a woman was amazed that someone did reach out and talk to her. Jesus talked to the Samaritan woman at the well that knee. And it was shocking. Because he didn't engage or imbibe the standard way of looking at things he didn't. He didn't have in his heart, the partiality that pervaded the culture. That was normal. But having a heart of God was abnormal, it was different. And so sadly, this still happens. Today, I mentioned we have a long history of dealing with this subject. And crazy Christians need to step up and address it, address our hearts deal with this. Sadly, in our culture, rice is something that many people don't want to talk about. And so what has happened is people are lobbing comments past one another. People are failing to listen, to talk to consider others as human. And so we need to deal with this don't mean, it's a sad reality in our country today. And it it really always has been. I don't know why we think we will escape prejudice. Because maybe we're modern, or we've arrived or we've done something. Prejudice has been throughout history. And it's still here today. What about financial status? Sometimes we look favorably upon people because well, they have money, they have wealth. Maybe they're a successful business person. In James chapter two. James chapter two. There, James addresses this subjects. In James chapter two and verse woman, my brothers show no partiality as you hold the faith in our Lord Jesus Christ, the Lord of Glory. For if a man wearing a gold ring and find clothing comes into your assembly, and a poor man and shabby clothing also comes in. And if you pay attention to the one who wears the fine clothes and say, you sit here in a good place, while you say to the poor man, you stand over there or sit down at my feet, have you not made distinctions among yourselves and become judges with evil thoughts? Aren't you practicing partiality? Aren't you discounting a human being based upon their financial status? And the question is, is that what God does? James goes on to say no, isn't

Jeremy Sweets  18:11
it clear that God has chosen the poor among us, and he has shown them grace and blessings. And so we see it's not really wealth or lack of wealth that determines your spiritual condition before God? What does God look at? God looks at the heart, doesn't he? He's concerned with the hearts. And so we need not be so shallow as considering someone that has money as good and someone that doesn't as bad. But sadly, that's what happens far too often. We may also look down upon someone simply for their social standing. And look chapter 18 And verse nine, it says that Jesus told this parable to some who trusted in themselves, that they were right, righteous, and treated others with contempt. Two men went up into a temple to pray one a Pharisee, and the other a tax collector. And you may remember that the Pharisee stands with his chest out, looking up proud, and says, I thank God that I'm not like these other people. Look at what I've done. I'm not like the tax collector, everyone knows that they should be discounted. Everyone knows that. That's the bad segment of society. Everyone knows that they're not like me, good and righteous. And yet it was the tax collector's heart that God approved of, and that Jesus highlighted, for he stood a distant off and he was not proud, but he was humble. And he asked for God's forgiveness. That's the heart we need. And I think that demonstrates it is not really our social standing. It's not our religious standing in terms of whether we go to church or not whether our names are on it. Roll that's also comes into play here. That's not what determines whether we're pleasing to God. It's not just whether we've been baptized to check that off the list and say, Well, I've done that. And now I must be pleasing to God. No, God requires godly lives, humble hearts. That's what he wants of us. And so we see social standing, we tend to do this, and this was related to finances as well. And other countries, they have caste systems where it's hard to get out of a segment of society, you're viewed as lowly or high based upon where you were born and who you were born to. And so we need to be careful about treating others in this way. One other I might mention is sometimes we pre judge others based upon their past actions. And Luke seven and verse 39. There it says, Now, when the Pharisee, you had invited him, speaking of Jesus saw this woman who was showering Jesus with her tears and wiping his feet. He said to himself, If this man were a prophet, you would have known who and what sort of woman this is that is touching him for she is a sinner. He made a judgment dittany, based upon what she had done in the past. And sadly, we can do the same thing. If you've been convicted of a crime, and you're a criminal, I don't want to have anything to do with you. If you've done something wrong, well, one strike and you're out in my book. But that's not the way Jesus viewed things. Yes, there are some people that persistence in and they will persist in that as many chances as they're given. But our role is not to make that determination or judgments, or discount others. Our role is to extend love and kindness, wanting others to do what's right, giving them opportunities to do what is right speaking to them the gospel so that they might do what is right. Let us not simply judge people based upon their past actions. Well, this is a list and I'm sure we can have many more certainly, the partiality of man. Well, we also need to understand that prejudice or partiality is a sin before God. It's not something to be taken lightly. Sometimes we may excuse ourselves and say, well, that's the way the culture is. I'm a product, my culture, and I can't help that. And after all, I'm not murdering anybody. But the truth is that God calls partiality and prejudice a sin. Notice in James two verses eight and nine, I stopped in verse five or six there previously, but notice in verse eight, nine as he continues the discussion,

Jeremy Sweets  22:49
if you really fulfill the royal law, according to the Scriptures, you shall love your neighbor as yourself, you are doing well. But if you show partiality, you are committing sin and are convicted by the law as transgressors. You might do every other work of the law. But if you commit this sin, he says, You're a transgressor of the law. It's sinful, it's sinful. And if that scenario were to play out today, among any of these factors, a wealthy person come in and we favor them or this person or this nation origin comes in, we favor them and disfavor another one, it is sinful. And we need to understand that we need not make excuses for ourselves. We need to listen to the scriptures here. It is a sin. In First John four in verse 20. There it says, If anyone says I love God and hates his brother, he is a liar. For he who does not love his brother whom he has seen, cannot love God whom he has not seen. I wonder how many wires prejudice has made. Those that claim to love God, but don't live it, that hate their brother, that treat them with contempt. Lord have mercy. Not only that, but we see that prejudice has a great deal of harm. You know, it's harmful to be told that you are less than to be devalued. To be considered inferior. Prejudice has done the world untold harm, it's hard to even measure the effects and we live in a world of prejudice and content. We live in a sin saturated world a world full of sin and prejudice is an example of that. We've seen that God is impartial but yet we practice the opposite. And we see this in the results as well. God wants what is best for us. He is impartial and loves us and He wants what's best for us. What do we get if we do the opposite of that? When we act the opposite way, with partiality, we get the opposite effect, not goodness and blessings, but great and grave harm. partiality has done harm in parenting. We see examples in scripture of parent being partial to one child favoring one child, and untold harm has been done through partiality and parenting. Prejudice has done harm in the court courts. In the Old Testament, there was a call upon God as a just an impartial God and judges should act the same way. And that should be the case today. The court system should be a place of fairness as much as is possible upon us. It should be a place of justice. But sadly, partiality, prejudice occurs even in the court system. partiality, has done untold harm in the neighborhood. neighbors that are prejudiced against one another, or not allowing certain people into the neighborhood because we want to keep this pure, not letting some people in. And so maybe we don't even want to see the people that are our neighbors in the world and just know that, well, they're not here, and I don't have to deal with that. Untold harm has been done in the neighborhood. And I might also add that untold harm has been done from prejudice in the church as well. The church, sadly, has swam along with the culture far too often, instead of swimming against the string. And that's true in all cultural elements, probably, to some degree. But it's true in this one as well. It's easy to look back at the past and say they were clearly ignorant. You know, we're enlightened today. But where are we swimming with the culture? away from God, in sinfulness as opposed to fighting against the string? Yes, prejudice has done harm in the church as well today. So what can we do about that? Is there something we can do to overcome prejudice? Well, I'd suggest that it's not going to be an overnight fix. It's not something you flip a switch, and automatically you have no more partiality in your heart.

Jeremy Sweets  27:29
It's hard for me to imagine that there is a someone that doesn't deal with this at all, though I wouldn't put it past some people that have godly hearts, that can see others. But I would guess for most of us in some way. We're prejudiced or partial against others in some way, and it's something we have to work on. It's something we have to work on. So what can we do? Well, the first thing we can do is look to Jesus Christ. God is the perfect example of impartiality, of love for all based on God's example and Deuteronomy 10 And verse 19. Remember I mentioned that passage when he says that God loves the sojourner. Notice what he says in verse 19. Love the sojourner, therefore, for you are sojourners in the land of Egypt, based upon how God is. That's how you should be. That was also the message of Jehoshaphat. In Second Chronicles 19, based upon how God is as a judge, that's how you should be, you need to be an impartial judge not taking a broad, but being fair with all people. Jesus was the perfect embodiment of God, and impartial God when he came to this earth and took on flesh. Jesus talked with the woman at the well shocking, shocking thing. It shocked her. You're going to talk to me, why would you talk to me because I'm a Samaritan. She had, in some ways, believed what society had told her over and over and over again, you're less than. And she was shocked when Jesus talked to her. Jesus reached out to the Pharisees, yes, those hypocrites. Not all of them were hypocrites. Some would follow Jesus. He talked to the harlots as well. The scribes, the tax collectors, the wealthy, the poor, Jesus reached out to everyone he could he didn't choose a segment of society that he loved and one that he did not. He loved all in John 13 In verse 34, it says, just as I have loved you, you also ought to love one another. Let us look to Jesus. Let us follow his example. Let us break cultural barriers, walls that exist Let us walk right through the sin, extend kindness and love to people that are outside of our group so to speak. In First John to in verse six, it says we ought to walk in the same way in which he walked. And in Philippians, two and verse five, have this mind among yourselves, which is yours in Christ Jesus, develop the heart and the mind of God, that's the best thing we can do. If we could dwell upon that it will change us. If we could dwell upon who God is, so that we could develop the same kind of heart, you be holy, for God is holding that should consume our fonts. Secondly, I would suggest that we need to guard our hearts, guard our hearts, we need to identify prejudice in our own hearts. What's sad with the the dialogue that takes place today is people are so quick to determine and strike people off based upon certain actions. And on the other hand, people deny and fail to look at themselves. So there's a lot of racism taking place, there's a lot of prejudice taking place, there's a lot of partiality taking place. But if you're to ask anyone, if they're partial, no one's doing this stuff, right? Everyone says, No, there's nothing like that, in me. That's a dangerous place to be for a Christian. To say that, that could never happen to me that will never be in my hearts. But we need to slow down a bit, and investigate our hearts, and really see is that is that there, we need to grapple with the prejudice that exists in our hearts, instead of being so quick to put our head in the sand and deny it, or any possibility. We need to identify it before it takes root. We need to see the value in others, God created all people in his image. All people have tremendous value before God because they have made in His image. They bear a likeness and a resemblance to God Almighty, how could they be less than if they have the image of God? How could they be discounted if they have the image and bear the image of God? Not only that, but the greatest gift and the greatest price was paid in all the world for each and every person, the gift of Jesus Christ who died on the cross for our sins.

Jeremy Sweets  32:32
For everyone's sins, Jesus did not choose to save one nation or one type of people. And so let us see the value in others. Let us also count others more significant than ourselves. Philippians two and verse three. Let us be a people that listen, James one and verse 19. Be quick to hear and slow to speak. Let us be a people that step into another person's shoes and practices empathy, consider what it's like to be in their situation. And let me add that that can only really happen by being with someone and listening to them. One of the problems of the dialogues in our country is we're not doing any listening are we? We just want to talk an awful lot. Sometimes we discount others based upon our experiences. I don't see prejudice, it doesn't exist today. You must not be dealing with it. You seem to find it under every rock, all you talk about is that we don't know what they've been through. We don't know what they've seen. And we never will as long as we adopt that kind of mentality. Let's be like Jesus, engage and talk to and listen to what other people are saying, I think that will go a long way. Let us forgive when we do experience prejudice. I love the example of of the Good Samaritan, one that had certainly suffered the effects of prejudice, but he didn't allow that to take away from the kind of attitude and heart that he needed to have toward others. If we've experienced prejudice, let us not have that taint, how we view all other people. But let us forgive and seek what is good. Let us practice goodness, even to those that are enemies. Let us pray for them. As Jesus commanded in Matthew, chapter five. And so let us guard our hearts, guard our hearts and let us also open our arms. I love that picture. I think that's what Jesus did. He opened his arms. You know, it's more than an attitude that is needed. One of the things we see in our country in the Declaration of Independence What's the statement all men are created equal. All men are created equal and endowed with certain Enel inalienable rights from the Creator. But sadly, the principle was not upheld in the practice wasn't. And that can happen with Christians candidates. We can have all the principles and truths of Scripture, but be blind to the sinfulness in our own hearts. And so let us learn something from our country and extend love and kindness and see the value in all people. Let us open our arms. Let us be kind to one another, as it says in Ephesians, four in verse 32, being gracious to one another as God in Christ Jesus has been gracious to you. Extend kindness, love, and grace, let us spend time with other people. A lot of times prejudices fall by the wayside when we get to know someone else. All Canadians are evil. Wait a minute, I go and spend time with Canadian and they're not that bad. You know what, they're just human beings. They're just like me. If falls by the wayside, if we will allow those barriers to be knocked down, spend time with others. Fathers mistreat you do what the Good Samaritan did. Behind back, let us return good for the evil that we get. Let us extend kindness. Let us treat others the way we want to be treated Matthew seven and verse 12. Let us spread the gospel without prejudice. Let us spread the gospel to all people. Maybe that's one of the most harmful things about prejudice is it doesn't allow the gospel to fully be given. Because we prejudge certain people now, you can't have this or you've got too much sin or the color of your skin or how much money you have discounts you. And what a crying shame. That is. Let me also suggest that sometimes opening your arms goes against the crowd. Everyone else in the crowd may have crossed arms, clenched fists, but as Christians were to open our arms anyway. Or maybe especially in the face of that, let us open our arms. Let me close with a picture that I found that was taken in 2005.

Jeremy Sweets  37:39
I'm sorry, that's beautiful. That's beautiful. We can learn a lot from children, can't we? I have no problem with that. I see the ugliness in adults sometimes the ugliness of sin. That's great. I would think that those two people if one was a Christian, who was not as they get older, they could share the gospel very easily with one another couldn't. Because of the love they're extending. I like that picture. I hope that picture is imprinted in our hearts and minds as a goal of what we can do with other people. It may be that you're here this morning and you're not a Christian, we're going to be singing an invitation song of the marvelous grace of our loving Lord. You can have your sins forgiven by believing that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of living God, repenting of your sins and turning away from a lifestyle selfishness and turning to a life of service by confessing that Jesus is the Christ and being baptized in the water for the forgiveness of your sins. When you do that, what you've done is made a lifelong commitment. And you need to be prepared for that commitment. If you're a Christian and you're not honoring that commitment, either through prejudice or any other sin and make your life right this very day. There's any subject to the invitation. Please come as we stand and sing at this time.
