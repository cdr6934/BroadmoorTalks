It's good to see all of you here today, if you want to open up your Bibles to the book of Acts, Acts chapter eight.

Conrad Harkrider  00:26
Before Jesus ascended back to heaven to be with the Father, one of the things that he told his disciples was to stay where they were to go to Jerusalem and stay there until they had received the power that was going to be given to them from the Holy Spirit's stay put. But then he encouraged them that once they had received that power, that they would then go throughout Jerusalem, and Judea, to Samaria, and to all the worth, then to all the world that gospel, that message about Jesus was going to spread it was going to go to every place, it would be spoken in houses and courtyards and palaces and in the prison, it would be told to both people who are great and small until the message had been taken to the whole world. This morning, I want for us to look at one of the accounts in the book of Acts about the spread of the gospel, and how the gospel spreads particularly to the region of Samaria. Read with me in Acts chapter eight, beginning in verse, beginning in verse four. It says, Therefore those who are scattered went everywhere preaching the Word. Then Philip went down to the city of Samaria and preached Christ to them. And the multitudes with one accord heated the things spoken by Philip hearing and seeing the miracles which he did, for unclean spirits crying with a loud voice, came, came out, and many who are possessed, and many who were paralyzed, and the lame were healed. And there was great joy in the city. But there was a certain man called Simon who previously practiced sorcery in the city, and astonished the people of Samaria, claiming that he was someone great, to whom they all gave heat from the least to the greatest, saying, This man is the great power of God. And they hated him because he had astonish them with his sorceries for a long time. But when they believe Philip as he preached the things concerning the kingdom of God, and the name of Jesus Christ, both men and women were baptized, then Simon himself also believed and when he was baptized, he continued with Philip, and was amazed seeing the miracles and the signs, which were done. Now, when the apostles who are at Jerusalem heard that Samaria had received the word of God, they sent Peter and John to them, who, when they had come down, prayed for them, that they might receive the Holy Spirit. For as yet he had fallen upon none of them, they had only been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. Then they laid their hands, they laid hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit. And when Simon saw that, through the laying on of the apostles hands the Holy Spirit was given, he offered them money, saying, Give me this power, also, that anyone on whom I lay hands may receive the Holy Spirit. But Peter said to Him, your money perish with you, because you thought the gift of God could be purchased with money, you have neither part nor portion in this matter, for your heart is not right in the sight of God. Repent therefore, of your wickedness, and pray God if perhaps the thought of your heart maybe forgiven you, for I see that you are poisoned by bitterness and bound by iniquity. Then Simon answered and said, Pray to the Lord for me, that none of the things which you have spoken, may come upon me. So when they testified and preach the word of the Lord, they returned to Jerusalem, preaching the gospel in many villages of the Samaritans. After the death of Stephen,

Conrad Harkrider  04:27
there was a great persecution that arose against the church. In Acts chapter eight and verse three, it says that there was one man in particular who was wreaking havoc upon the disciples. He was ravaging the church going into houses and dragging men and women off to prison. And because of that intense harassment, the believers begin to spread out they are fleeing, they're leaving Jerusalem. Verse four of X eight says They were scattered everywhere. And Luke, the writer of Acts is now going to give us a picture into what happens to those who are sent abroad. He follows one of the men, Philip, and shows us what takes place after he leaves, Jerusalem. So I'd love like for us to look at the different individuals or groups that are described in this account. First of all, we're told about Philip, this is not fill up the apostle, but fill up one of the seven. If you remember, in Acts chapter six, there were a group of Greek speaking widows who were being neglected in the daily distribution in the provisions that they were supplying for them. And so the apostles appointed these seven men, Philip was one of them in order to take care of these needs. Not only did Philip have a servant heart, but we see here in Acts chapter eight, that he was a courageous messenger, X eight and verse four says that those who were scattered everywhere went preaching the word, they were taking the message with them. Imagine being in this position, one of the men that you work closely with a counterpart, or a co worker of yours, after giving his testimony about Jesus is dragged out of the city and then stoned to death. That's what happened to Stephen. And surely Philip would have known him well, and his murder would have had an if an effect on him, it would have made an impression on him. But here we see, he didn't allow that fear or intimidation to stop him from sharing the message about Jesus Christ. And so the believers may have been scattered, but the Word of God was not silenced. Philip was a bold and courageous messenger. He goes down to Samaria, and I want us to notice the message that he took to this to these people. What was he telling them? When he got there? Look at verse five. It says, in the multitudes with one accord, he did the thing spoken by Philip, hearing and seeing the miracle, as verse six, verse five, Then Philip went down to the city of Samaria and preached Christ to them. Verse five says that he proclaimed or preached Christ, the emphasis of what he was telling people was on Jesus Christ. Notice that he didn't tell him about the church back in Jerusalem. There's this group of people, and they're really great. And they have amazing worship assemblies. He didn't tell them about Peter, you've you've got to meet this guy, Peter. He's great with young people. And he literally walked on water. He didn't try to sell them or get them to be a part of some organization or club or group. He simply preached Christ. Look down in verse 12x, eight and verse 12. It says, But when they believed Philip as he preached the things concerning the kingdom of God, and the name of Jesus Christ, both men and women were baptized, he told them about the kingdom, he told them about the good news of Jesus Christ, about the authority of Christ. His message was centered, not on himself, or his wisdom or knowledge or the things that he was doing, but instead it was focused on the Lord Jesus Christ. When we talk to others about faith, religion, the word of God, are we stressing things about certain types of doctrines? Do we try to tell them about specifically about our church? Or are we sharing with them the good news about Jesus Christ Philips message was focused on the Lord. Not only was he telling him about Christ, but he was also able to perform these great miracles. Verse seven describes how there were these amazing things that were happening in the city, the people with unclean spirits were coming and they were crying out a a public demonstration of the power as they were released from the bonds of these spirits. Those who are paralyzed and lame were brought in to fill up and he was able to heal them to raise them up. And there's no wonder that there was great joy verse eight in the city. But I want us to notice what was occurring here. It wasn't just about miracles and people being healed. Good things being done. Look at verse six. It says, And the multitudes with one accord heated the things spoken by Philip, hearing, and seeing the miracles, which he did. They paid attention. They heeded what Philip was saying. They saw the signs, and then they heard and believed the message that he was delivering. This is a critical point, because in the early church, you often have sought you frequently have signs and the word being going together, they are coupled together, what was the purpose of that as messengers as people who were telling others about the kingdom? How were people to know how are they to verify that these things were true, that Phillip and the apostles were, in fact, speaking on behalf of the Lord that they were telling the truth, that's where the miracles came in, because of the signs and the miracles, it verified, and, and gave credence to the things that they were speaking, think about in the beginning of Acts and Acts chapter two. On the day of Pentecost, there's a great sound of rushing wind that comes through the city. And all of a sudden, the apostles are standing up, and they're speaking in languages, from all over the world languages that they have never studied. And as the people come together, it doesn't just stop right there. Peter stands up and he delivers the gospel for the very first time the first gospel message in Acts chapter three, Peter and John, they go into to the temple and there's a man who is lame that is outside the gate, they heal him and raise him up. And as all the people come to see what has just happened, Peter again stands and proclaims to them or shares with them. The gospel message. In Acts chapter 16, Paul, and Silas are in prison. And it's the middle of the night and all of a sudden, there's this earthquake and the prison doors are open, the chains fall off of the prisoners. Certainly that was a sign. But what happens next, the jailer comes in, and eventually Paul and Silas will share the message of Christ with him and his entire family. Miracles were great, they help people walk, they raise up their dead, they cast out demons, but miracles without the word have no lasting benefit. In other words, miracles are they're only temporary, the person who is raised up from the dead will eventually die, the person who was relieved of some type of sickness is going to get sick again one day, but with but the Word of God the good news about Jesus Christ, that's what offers the eternal lasting benefit. And so these men like Philip, they weren't just trying to help people's physical needs, they were pointing them back to the greater purpose, which was the message. And that's what we see here and Philip. Let's also think about who Philip was going to speak to. He goes down to the region of Samaria to speak to the Samaritans the Samaritans are not a highly regarded group of people. In the Scriptures, the Jews would have looked down upon them, and they, in many ways, they would have been unlikely converts. They were a mixed race. In Second Kings chapter 17. It talks about how after the northern tribes of Israel were carried off into captivity, one of the Assyrian kings brought foreigners and settled them back in the land. And what that did was the people, the children of Israel, who were still in the land began to intermarry with these foreigners, and they also the foreign people began to introduce their gods, their idols, their religious beliefs. And so what you had was a mixed blood, a mixed religion and this melting of different identities, different cultures. And what that produced was people who still worship the Lord, but they didn't follow the law of Moses, and because of that they were despised by the Jews. When Jesus meets the whim, the woman at the well and John chapter four, and he begins to talk to her and he asks her for a drink of water, she says, she basically says, Why are you talking to me? Jews don't have any dealings with Samaritans. And so that's the dynamic that Philip is going into, that he's working with here. The cultural divide that exists exists. But notice that when the disciples are scattered everywhere, they don't make selections, or there's no discrimination there, they're going into all places speaking the Word of God, to those that they come in contact with. And so we find Philip going down to the place that no one really wanted to be preaching to people that no one really liked. He goes and takes the message of the word to the Samaritans. When I was growing up, I had a friend whose dad was in the military. And we lived in San Antonio, Texas, he was stationed at one of the bases there, but then he got orders that he was going to be transferred to somewhere else. And so the whole family had to move. And we found out that they were going to be stationed in Hawaii. What a difficult assignment, right? We felt so bad that he was gonna have to go and live in the tropical paradise. And sometimes that's what we want. We want the easy assignment. We want to be in a place that's beautiful, where people are friendly, and they like us and we can fit in, send us somewhere, that's nice. Who wants to go down to Samaria with the Half Blood quasi religious people, and yet, that's where Philip finds himself proclaiming the news. And guess what happened when he went there? They received the word. They were open, they were receptive, they were willing to believe. Look at what verse 12 says, when they believed Philip, as he preached the things concerning the kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, both men and women were baptized. They accepted what Philip was teaching. And they believed in the word that he brought when it comes to sharing the gospel with other people, are

Conrad Harkrider  16:56
there certain types of people that we're looking for? Are there specific groups that we think would be more open, more willing, more receptive to the word, maybe I'm looking for someone that's educated, someone that is good looking someone that is a productive member of society. And most most of the time, we want to talk to people who are pretty normal, who have a regular life, maybe they're married, they've got kids, they're a part of the community. But I'm not as interested in reaching out to the person who's got tattoos all over their body, or who has a past or a history or who's got lots of baggage, or maybe someone who doesn't speak English as their first language, or who looks much different than me, they are more like a Samaritan. It's something that we need to be conscientious of, when we come together to worship. Do we welcome those who walk through the doors, the husband and wife with two kids who are dressed nicely? Do we receive them in the same way as the one who is single and dressed in normal, everyday clothes, those who are coming to our presence should receive the same type of honor and respect. All will not accept the gospel invitation.

Conrad Harkrider  18:28
But the invitation should be extended to all. So as we think about talking to friends, co workers, neighbors, people in the community, we shouldn't draw lines and try to make decisions about who would be open who would be willing to receive but instead invite others regardless of where they are, at this point in their life. Because the gospel message is for everyone. Not only did the Samaritans receive the word, but notice, at the end of verse 12, it says that both men and women were baptized into Christ. Look at verse 13. It says Simon himself also believed and when he was baptized, he continued with Philip, why are these people baptized? Luke doesn't really say anything about baptism up until this point. He says that Philip was teaching and speaking about Christ, he was proclaiming the good news of the kingdom and then we find these people getting baptized. Does that make sense? Well, it does if we understand the significance, and the importance of baptism, and how it plays into the gospel message. In Matthew chapter 28, just before Jesus is about to go back to heaven, one of the last things that He says to His disciples, He says, Go therefore and make disciples of all men, baptizing them in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. And so when you go to Acts chapter two on the day of Pentecost, that's what we see them doing. After Peter speaks that message to the people and they are cut to the heart and they ask the question, What shall we do? Peter says, Repent, and let every one of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ. See, baptism is what washes away our sins. It's not the physical water itself. It's the grace of God, the blood of Jesus Christ. But when we submit our selves and our lives to the Lord, in baptism, we are buried with Christ. And then we are able to be raised into a new life. Romans chapter six. What you see in the Scriptures after people accepted the Lord, they are immediately baptized. That's what we see here with the Samaritans. And with Simon, the sorcerer, there is this sense of urgency. This is something that can't be put off, it can't wait. And that's why you see in Acts, chapter eight, the Ethiopian eunuch is traveling along the road on a journey, gets out of his chariot, and goes down into the water to be baptized. In Acts chapter 16. After the flippy and jailer receives the word, he goes that very night and he and all his family are baptized, If baptism were just a good thing that we do a part of the good deeds of a Christian, a part of our obedience, that why would there be such urgency upon the part of the people who, after receiving the word, they go ahead and are immersed in water? Baptism has a special significance. And that's why Anand is in Acts 22. When he's speaking to Paul, he says, Why are you waiting? Why are you waiting on rise, and be baptized, and wash away your sins, calling on the name of the Lord, the Samaritans understood this importance? Let's now turn to Simon. Most of the account, much of the account here in Acts Eight focuses on Simon. And we see first of all, that he was a man that was respected by all verse nine says that he had astonish the people of Samaria. For a long time. Verse 10, says that they called him the great power of God, how would you like that for a nickname, some pretty impressive magic tricks that were going on here. People thought that he was divine, he had this great power and authority from God. Look at verse 10. It says that all the people were listening to him from the least to the greatest. This is not just the poor people, the commenters that are being persuaded by what Simon is saying this is everyone in the region in the city are coming and listening to the things that this man says he was a man of tremendous influence. And then comes Phillip. Phillip comes into town and begins preaching the things about Jesus and about the gospel and about the kingdom, and performing miracles by the power of the Holy Spirit. And now we see a difference. The people of Samaria come face to face with real power. With the power and the authority of the Holy Spirit. They see the true power of God. One of our favorite places to go eat back in Texas is a fast food restaurant called Water burger. Some of you may have been there, but they have for dessert. They have these little apple pies, hot apple pies, I think you can get two of them for $1. And they're kind of like a pastry of a Hot Pocket almost that's filled with apples and cinnamon and lots of sugar and they're pretty good. Now imagine if that was the only apple pie that you had ever tasted. That was what you thought apple pie was. And then you go over to someone's house and their grandma is making a homemade from scratch. Apple pie. She's kneading the dough by hand. She's slicing the apples. She adds the sugar and the cinnamon and nutmeg and the real butter and then she bakes it in the oven until it's golden brown and you put a scoop of ice cream on that. And now what is the comparison? There is no difference. Once you have tasted and seeing the real thing you can To tell a counterfeit or an imposter or an imitator, and that's what we see here with the Samaritans after seeing the real deal, true power from God, they are persuaded. And what we see in Simon is that he himself acknowledges this real power. In verse 13, it says that he also believes and he is baptized, and begins to, he is amazed by the miracles and the signs that have been performed. This man who wants caused amazement, and all in others is now himself, awestruck by what he's seen. And that would have given great credibility to the gospel as someone like Simon, who may have been a great skeptic, is now turned in to a believer. Well, as the Word travels back to Jerusalem, the apostles here that the Samaritans have accepted the word they send Peter and John down to the city. And Luke tells us that when they arrived, they pray that they can receive the Holy Spirit. It says that, in verse 16, the Holy Spirit hadn't fallen on any of them. And so they come down to impart this gift to them. And it says that the apostles lay their hands on them and the Samaritans received this gift. And notice what verse 18 says, it says, And when Simon saw that, through the laying on the apostles hands, the Holy Spirit was given, he offered them money saying, Give me this power, also, that anyone on whom I lay my hands may receive the Holy Spirit, Simon sees a an opportunity here, he realizes, hey, people are impressed by this kind of thing. And this is real power. And so he wants to seize the opportunity. And he offers money in order to purchase this ability. Now notice, it's interesting that Simon doesn't ask to have the power to do miracles. But instead, he wants the ability to pass on the gift that appears to be something that's more rare, only that, that the apostles are able to do. And so, as he offers this money, he's rebuked by Peter, what I think what we see here is a man who is falling back into sin. I believe that Simon was genuine, he was honest, in his desire to be baptized and to follow and to accept the Lord. But now, we see him sliding back into his old life into the things that he's the way that he kind of he's always operated. And notice what Peter's responses. This is pretty, pretty shocking. Peter doesn't mince words, he doesn't beat around the bush here. He say basically says in verse 20, that your money your silver, is going to perish with you, you and your money are going to be destroyed, you're going to hell is kind of what he's saying. He says you're poisoned by bitterness, you're bound up by iniquity. He says, You have no part or portion in this ministry. Wow. Peter, maybe Peter was kind of in a grumpy mood that day, but he just lays it on Simon, in very stark terms. And what I'm impressed with is that Peter and the other apostles are not interested in money. This was not a economic venture for them, where they're going down into the cities, and they're trying to start up things that will somehow benefit them. Certainly healing people of lifelong illness, illnesses would have been a lucrative business. But that's not what their focus was. Also, they're not afraid to tell people what they need to hear. You know, we live in a time where it's not culturally acceptable to tell someone that they're doing something wrong, especially if it were to be someone who's a prominent member in the city. You know, Peter could have said, Hey, this guy, Simon has got a lot of connections. He's got some influence. We don't want to upset him. We really need him on our side. And so let's just try to work him in and use what he's got here. We don't want to you know, rock the rock the boat here and offend him. We wouldn't want him to go away and get upset. But instead he comes right out with it. And And thankfully, what we see in Simon is a heart that is open that is receptive. After hearing this rebuke, Simon Says, to pray to the Lord so that none of the things that you have spoken will come upon me.

Conrad Harkrider  29:55
You know, as we think about falling back into sin, just because because we believe in the Lord, after a person gets baptized, and they're so excited and they're ready to begin their new walk with the Lord, that doesn't mean that temptation isn't still there doesn't mean that there aren't still sins that we really wrestle with that we struggle with. And so it's important to remember that all of us are still vulnerable. We're susceptible to things from our past life that can come back in and Satan is always trying to use Shanks in the arm or points of weakness to try to cause us to stumble. And he attacks us where we're weak. Verse 25, says that the apostles continued to testify and preach the word of the Lord injured after they returned to Jerusalem after preaching the gospel in many villages of the Samaritans. So that promise that Jesus made, that the word of God would be spread throughout Judea, Jerusalem, into Samaria, that's now being fulfilled, the gospel is being taken to another part of the world. And that's that promise is still in effect to the today. The gospel has the power to change people's lives, whether it be a Samaritan, or a sorcerer, or whoever it may be the gospel can come into the hearts of a person and turn their life back to the Lord. And so we're going to close this morning by asking the question, are there any here who have not received the word of God, the good news about Jesus Christ, it's the most important decision that a person can make. And if you're not a Christian, you can begin that process that step today by being baptized, repenting of your sins and being raised to walk a new life. You can start that relationship with Christ today. If you have any. Please come down to the front as we stand in scene
