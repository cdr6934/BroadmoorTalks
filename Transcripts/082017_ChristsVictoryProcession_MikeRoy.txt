You know, every now and then you come across a verse of Scripture that really gets your attention, language that is so compelling and vivid that it makes you stop and ponder its meaning. This happened to me recently when I was reading an article that was based on a verse from Second Corinthians chapter two. Basically, in chapter two second Corinthians If you're familiar with that Paul urges the Corinthians to reaffirm their love for a repentant brother. He mentioned in verse 12, that a preaching opportunity was given to him and tro as but Paul was so anxious in his mind and worried about the response of the Corinthians from the letter that he wrote, rebuking them are actually probably at this point, encouraging them to reaffirm the love for this brother, that he left tro ash and went to Macedonia, looking for Titus. And so there he did find Titus received the good report about the Corinthians response to Paul's letter and but in verse 14, of, of second Corinthians chapter two, he makes the statement, but thanks be to God, who always leads us in triumph in Christ with a powerful verse and an image that is presented before us. And I want to use the statement from Second Corinthians chapter two and verse 14, as the basis of my lesson and the verses that follow. You know, we all face struggles, we all face trial, sometimes anxiety, sometimes fear, worry all those things. Paul knew all about that. His spirit was troubled, he was anxious to know what was the response from the Corinthians and the letter that he had written them. But in this first, Paul pushes through that he sent us a picture of a general marching in a victorious procession, after winning a battle. Can y'all hear me okay? So the microphone on. And so this text, I think, reveals Paul's core belief that God would bring him through all of his troubles, and disappointments. And so this evening, I want to talk with you about the idea of marching in Christ's victory procession. And so the text is going to come from Second Corinthians chapter two that I've made mention of that, again, appreciate those songs that have been led this evening as we focus on this idea, but look at this text with me. And second Corinthians chapter two, verses 14 through 16, verses 12. And 13, mentioned that Paul leftarrow, s went to Macedonia to find Titus but in verse 14, he makes this statement, I'll be looking at several translations in just a moment, said, But thanks be to God who always leads us in triumph in Christ, in manifest to us the sweet aroma of the knowledge of Him in every place, for we are a fragrance of Christ to God among those who are being saved. And among those who are perishing, to the one and aroma from death, to death, to the other, and aroma from life to life, and who is adequate for these things. For we're not like many peddling the Word of God, but as from sincerity, but as from God, we speak in Christ in the sight of God. So here's a compelling passage for us to think about. And the first point that I want us to see as we look at this passage, understanding the thoughts and the anguish and maybe the anxiety that was racing through Paul's mind, the picture that we need to see as we as we serve God, that we are victorious soldiers in Christ triumphant procession. Notice there in verse 14, and that's what he's that's the message that he's saying that in spite of all the uncertainty of not knowing what was going on with the Corinthian, brethren, this is the the core belief that brought him through the the trials and uncertainty that he was wrestling with. Notice a few. Translation, this is the ESV and in verse 14, Paul says, But thanks be to God who in Christ always leads us in triumphal procession. Again, just get that image. Thanks be to God. Even in the midst of his uncertainty and the apprehension and maybe even some discouragement. He said, Thanks be to God who in Christ always leads us in triumphal procession. What's he talking about? The NIV says this. Thanks be to God who always leads us as captives in Christ's triumphal procession. The New Living Translation says, but thank God He has made us his captives, and continues to lead us along in Christ triumphal procession.

It's a picture of a Roman general coming back from battle triumphant, and as the general comes into the city into the town, he's got all of the the spoils of war. He's got the captives and this may be a different word here, but he's got those the enemies that he defeated maybe some of the spoils he's got all his army marching and that And then in that triumph, triumphant procession. So that's the picture that we have here. And it's talking about some Roman general is talking about Jesus Christ. He, he triumphs always. There's no battle, no difficulties, too great for God to great for Jesus Christ. So that's the image that Paul paints that for us. And so it's a reminder that he's saying that really about us that, that, that we're, in a sense, the captive, we're the ones where we're following Christ's lead. We're marching victoriously with Christ in this spiritual battle. And so it's a reminder to us that is we think about the confidence that God conveys to us as we serve him. It's not so much so much that we run towards victory. But we run in victory, sexually both, we run towards victory. But while we're running, we are victorious. That's what he said he made his calf he continues to lead us along in Christ's triumphal procession, Jesus Christ wins over everything, and everybody, all the enemies of the cross fail. And that's the picture that Paul presents for us here. So Paul conveys a sense of confidence and assurance in his statement, that although he had no rest in His Spirit, he was anxious. He was troubled in all he had all the things that we wrestled with, he makes that statement. Universally. 14, when you say thanks be to God, who in who in Christ always leads us in triumphal procession. The question for each of us this evening is is the question is that your mindset? Do you do live with that mindset that God leaves us in a triumphant procession? We're marching towards heaven. We're not we're not trying to avoid defeat, we are marching victoriously. And that's the mindset that Paul has to jump over to First Corinthians chapter nine, Paul uses the language of an athletic event. You said, Do you not know that those who run in a race all run, but only one receives the prize, he said, Run in such a way that you may win. He goes on to talk about competing in the games and all that the discipline that's involved in that. But he says Run in such a way that she may win rather than we run the spiritual race of life following Jesus Christ to win the battle not to lose it. Sometimes, I play racquetball with Jesse or somebody else. My main goal is to avoid losing. And maybe we can relate to that. And but actually, at this point, there's no, no way to escape the habit. It just happens. And so many times in life are like that. I just don't want to lose. That's not the goal. The goal is to win. It's not to avoid defeat. And that's what he's saying here to run in such a way that you win, we win over fear, we win over failure, we win over discouragement, we win over anxiety, we win over doubt, we win over depression. It's not easy, but we persevere. And that's what he's this this is Paul's mindset. So we we triumph victoriously over all the lives of Satan. And so this is a mindset that I believe each of us need to have. So the first image that you have there, and second Corinthians chapter two and verse 14, is that we are victorious soldiers marching, and Christ triumphant procession, we are on the winning team. If we're on the winning team, don't quit. Don't give up don't go back into the world. And how many times do we see that happen? Christians long term Christians, walking away from their faith walking away from God, why? Paul said, even though he had a lot of the thoughts swirling in his mind about giving up or maybe and I'm just energetic, interjecting some thoughts here.

Mike Roy  08:57
He was concerned, he was anxious, but not seeing ties, all these thoughts swirling around him. But he said in the midst of that, he said, I'm marching in the Lord's army and marching with a confidence because we're going to be victorious. So that's the first image that we see there. Secondly, is we're gonna we're gonna go ahead and look at this text. And this has always been one of my favorite ways of preaching. Just take us a section of scripture and kind of mind the verses and see what it's talking about. So it goes on to say it's really the same verses we run to spiritual race. And we're sharing the gospel with us we give off we dispel or send off the sweet aroma of the knowledge of God. So look there, verse 14, I'll put that up on the screen in just a minute. So But thanks be to God who always leaves us in triumph in Christ and manifest through us the sweet aroma of the knowledge of Him in every place. The that's the numeric and standard version. That is we were marching triumphantly in Christ procession and we manifest this, this sweet aroma of the knowledge of Him in every place. The NIV says it this way, that, but thanks for the God who always leads us as captives in Christ's triumphal procession and uses us to spread the aroma of the knowledge of him everywhere. And then New Living Translation says, Now He uses us to spread the knowledge of Christ everywhere, like the sweet perfume Summit, no matter what's going on. And where we're working is serving in God's kingdom. As we share the message of the gospel, that's an aroma. I think that kind of goes up to God. But also, if we're spreading the knowledge of Christ, at every turn, it's interesting, when I was doing some research about the generals coming back from battle, so they've come into the city in this great big procession, this great big parade, sometimes it have lions, pulling, type a chariot, or sometimes they'd have elephants, the big general pulling the chariot had all these people, the enemies that they had captured the spoils and all that, and they would often burn incense in that situation. And, and no doubt these the prisoners who were who are captured, which would smell that aroma. And as it goes on to talk about this, in this context, those who obey the gospel, receive eternal life, but those who do not obey the gospel, are going to face eternal death. But it's a reminder to us that this is our our task is we're running the spiritual race triumphantly following Jesus Christ. We want to share the knowledge of the gospel with everyone that we can possibly come in contact with. As we sometimes sing the song we are the world's Bible. I think about my neighbors, they go to church this morning, again, it makes me think about an opportunity to talk to to them about the gospel, and what's really involved in obeying God's word. But we have so many opportunities to do that. We are Kingdom citizens, and we want to spread the knowledge of Christ everywhere we go. And in doing that, we become this sweet perfume, going up to God. And as we spread that knowledge, look at Colossians chapter four with me for just a moment. Excuse me, in Colossians chapter four Colossians you have to foreign verse to Paul writing to these Clawson said this Devote yourselves to prayer, keeping alert in it with an attitude of Thanksgiving, praying at the same time for us as well that God will open up to us a door for the word so that we may speak forth the mystery of Christ, for which I've also been imprisoned, that I'm that I may make it clear in the way I ought to speak. He said in verse five, conduct yourselves with wisdom toward outsiders, making the most of the opportunity, let your speech always be with grace as though seasoned with salt, so that you will know how you should respond to each person. So when you think about this, the reality is a God uses us imperfect, though we might be to spread the gospel to friends and neighbors and family, people all around us, we want to careful with our speech, it should be with grace. Sometimes in talking with others, even in family members, there's a sense of frustration has come through my mouth. And that's not the attitude that God wants us to have. But it is a reminder to us that is we are dispelled. With that we dispelled the sweet aroma. As we share the gospel of Jesus Christ and knowledge of Jesus Christ, everywhere that we go. It's interesting to notice in the text, that the same aroma or the same line of use to figure from our

Mike Roy  13:45
one of our goals last year, being the light of the world, the same light or aroma that we shed on others, produces two very different results. Think about that. So Paul talks about preaching the gospel in in, in facing difficulties that that is common in that process. But he he remained steadfast and committed to that process, knowing that he was going to do his best to bring others into God's kingdom, before it was too late. Notice there. And verses 15 and 16. Paul says For we are a fragrance of Christ to God among those who are being saved and among those who are perishing, to one in aroma from death to death to the other and aroma from life to life. I think I've got those on the screen also. The ESP is a little bit different. Paul says For we are the aroma of Christ, think about that we're the we're the perfume of Christ, we have the aroma of Christ, to God among those who are being saved, and among those who are perishing, to one a fragrance from death to death to the other a fragrance from life to live look at some other another translation the New Living translation puts it this way our lives are a Christ like fragrance rising up to God. But this fragrance is perceived differently by those who are being saved by those who are perishing, to those who are perishing. We are a dreadful smell of death and doom. But to those who are being saved, we are a life giving perfume. So in the Lord's church, as we encourage one another and preach the gospel, we can assure each other of the eternal victory that awaits us, I mentioned a minute ago about the thieves, the aroma when these generals would come into town. And so when you imagine these, these prisoners that had been captured, and they're they're coming into the town with a general and they could smell the burning incense, they could smell all those aromas. For them, that was an aroma that led to their the slaughterhouse they would they would be put to death or thrown to the lions, with some some Gladiator, they might have faced slavery at that point. And so he's saying with us, that is we, as our lives reflect Christ's love and wholeness, we're like this fragrance rising up to God. And for those who obey the gospel, it's a a delightful fragrance. But for those who reject the gospel, it's a it's a dreadful smell of death and doom. And so again, this reminder, that this the same light or the same aroma, that we dispel produces two very different results in the Gospel. Notice, one pastor that comes to mind is Second Thessalonians chapter one, if you want to look there with me for just a moment. Second Thessalonians chapter one, Paul uses this type of imagery in the context of the return of Christ, excuse me, Second Thessalonians chapter one. In verse six, he says, For after all, it is only just for God to repay with affliction, those who, who afflict you, and to give relief to you who are afflicted, and to us as well. When the Lord Jesus will be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels in flaming fire, dealing out retribution to those who do not know God, and to those who do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus, these will pay the penalty of eternal destruction away from the presence of the Lord, and from the glory of His power, when it comes to be glorified in the saints on that day, and to be marveled at among all who have believed for our testimony to you was believed. So Paul says, When Jesus returns, He is going to give relief, and he's going to give blessings to his people, and salvation and comfort and assurance. But when Jesus comes back, those who do not know God who have who do not obey the gospel, they're going to face the unmitigated wrath of a holy God. It's not because that's what God wants to give us, because they refused his love. They refused his real, they refused his word. And as we spread the gospel, as we share that with others around us, some respond in faith and will enjoy the blessings of God, but those who do not, will have a very different outcome for all eternity. So it's interesting to think that the same light that we shine, the same aroma that we give off around the world has two significantly different results, for some is going to be eternal joy, eternal glory. But for others who reject God's will, God's eternal condemnation. And so in connection with that.

Mike Roy  18:44
The fourth point that I want want to notice from this text, it's understand that our adequacy to share this life changing gospel that produces eternal consequences comes from God, it's not from us. We don't send people to hell, we don't even save them ourselves, we should share the word that has the power to save people's souls. And in verse 16, in the context that we just looked at, when these said, to the one, that aroma from death to death to the other and an aroma from life to life, and he says, Who is adequate for these things? Who is adequate to produce this type of consequence? saving someone's soul from eternity in hell? Or in a situation with those who reject God's will face saying, eternal condemnation from God who is adequate from for this? Not me, not you. But God is our adequacy. Our sufficiency comes from God. That's the point that he's making over there. When he talks, he sees himself he sees us, following Christ in this victory procession as soldiers of Christ are rising as we say marching with God. In seeing the two very different results from the fragrance of Christ, the fragrance of Christ, amongst some will result in obedience and love and joy and glory. But the fragrance of Christ among others, causes them to harden their hearts. And they reject the will of God. And so in that context, though, Paul is saying that we the the, the power to do this comes from God, it's not something that we have resonant within ourselves. This reminder is I think about Mark chapter four, when Jesus tells the parable of the sower, the sower sows the seed and lands on four different types of soils, on most of the soils, it's unproductive. And those those people who hear that word, do not respond to faith, but on one type of soil, they do respond and they are fruitful, and they multiply, and they are blessed because of that. And but again, there is the reminder, that the power, the power to change lives is not in you or me, It's in God's Word, we need to think about that on a regular basis. Notice Paul says that so much. And just the very next chapter, I put this up on the screen. So as Paul talks about his work, because he's a minister of the gospel, because of his work there in Corinth, and maybe with the discipline that he sort of initiated, he was facing maybe some criticism from Ben, they're questioning his apostleship. But it Paul goes on, he says in verse four such confidence we have through Christ toward God, not that we are adequate in ourselves to consider anything is coming from ourselves, but our adequacy is from God, or adequacy is from God. And those are also when he says, who also made us adequate or sufficient, as servants of a New Covenant, not of the letter, but of the Spirit for the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life. So it's reminder from this text, brethren, in the process of preaching the gospel, and letting the way that aroma, dissipate from our lives and letting our light shine before others, some people will be saved, and many other people will harden their hearts and be lost for all eternity. But the power to save souls doesn't originate within ourselves. It comes from God, it comes from his word. And we need to, to recognize that. One other point that I want us to look at from this brief text this evening.

Mike Roy  22:35
And this is Paul's motivation. Again, he faced a lot of criticism, and in doing His work of evangelism and trying to correct these brethren, and sometimes that's involved in preaching. But the point here is that we preach the Gospel, Paul said, We preach the gospel as if we were standing in the presence of Jesus Christ. Again, as he concludes, this brief section over here, you'll notice that's this is his motivation that is driving him. And, and let me go and put this up on the screen. And verse 17, it says, For you, we are not like so many. This is the ESV, peddlers of God's word, but as men of sincerity is commissioned by God, in the sight of God, we speak in Christ. That's pretty plain language, isn't it? That's pretty plain motivation. And that's my motivation for preaching God's word. I'm confident it is for all of us here in positions of leadership. And so when we speak on the subject of baptism, or the Lord's Supper, or giving, or singing without musical instruments, or the idea of being born again, we preach this message as if we're standing in the presence of a holy God. This is not my message. It is not your message. This is God's word. So when we preach God's word, that is what motivates us to preach. In fact, in second Timothy chapter four, when Paul was writing to Timothy, this was precisely the the mindset that he wanted. Timothy to have in Second Timothy chapter four, in verse one. He said, I solemnly charge you in the presence of God and of Christ Jesus, who is to judge the living in the dead, and by His appearing and His Kingdom, preach the word be ready in season and out of season reprove, rebuke, exhort with great patience and instruction. What's the what's it all about? What's the great motivation there? The charges to preach God's word, in the presence of God, and in the presence of Jesus Christ, and that's what Paul is saying over here. So when there's criticism that he faced among the Corinthians, the language is pretty, pretty plain, he says, as men of sincerity as commissioned by God now this the apostles and we don't have that same commission but the principle I think of is is a is a lesson for us there in the sight of God. As we speak in Christ, so we need to remember that as we preach God's word that we are speaking for him. And we want to be sure that we are faithful to God. So as you look at this text this evening, hopefully, you'll be encouraged by Paul's mindset, especially that you'll see in verse 314, that in the midst of the uncertainty in the midst of the anxiety, and in the midst of the worry, and the concern of all those thoughts that were swirling around his mind, he paints this picture of of a victory march with Jesus Christ, but thanks be to God, who always leads us in triumph in Christ, that our mindset, brethren, that we are, we are marching in the Lord's army to a followers of Jesus Christ, we're not going to lose, we're going to win the battle, if we will stay faithful to Him. And so the question is we, if we serve God faithfully, what's the result of marching in the Lord's army serving Him faithfully, in Revelation chapter three, verse 21, Jesus's message to the church at Laodicea, which was at the point where Jesus was going to spit them out of his mouth. If they didn't repent, he tells him to, to open up the door, and he would die with them. And then in verse 21, he says to the one who is victorious, spread, and we can be victorious, we have to be victorious. We're following in the victorious triumph and procession of Christ, to the one who is victorious, I will give the right to sit with Me on My throne. Just as I was victorious, and sat down with My Father on his own, that's the result of marching and triumphantly in Christ, victorious procession,

Mike Roy  26:44
we end up can you imagine that I still have a hard time when I read Revelation, chapter three, verse 21, to understand that we can sit down with Christ on his throne and rule or reign with Him forever. And again, that's really kind of the mindset that Paul had in the midst of all his struggles there in Corinth. He said, Thanks be to God who always leads us in triumph. Doesn't God always bring you through your truck struggles he does for me, been a Christian for about 40 years now. And I think back when I was in Okinawa, Japan and traveling around the world, I understand God's hand was always there. He leads all of us, every single one of us, sometimes we doubt it, but that's the message. That's the truth that permeated Paul's mind, even in the midst of an upheaval in his world and uncertainty. And certainly Paul's mindset is, is something that is committed to each of us here this evening. And you're not a Christian and you can't have that victory. You can't have that confidence that comes to faith in obeying the Gospel, Jesus Christ. If to become a Christian, you have to believe that Jesus is the Messiah must be willing to repent of your sins, then of course, you must confess you confess your faith in him and then you must Yes, obey the gospel in terms of being baptized in water to have your sins forgiven, that makes you a Christian. Or maybe it that there you have those here this evening. You simply need the prayers of this congregation whatever you need is, we encourage you to come forward while we stand and sing this invitation song
