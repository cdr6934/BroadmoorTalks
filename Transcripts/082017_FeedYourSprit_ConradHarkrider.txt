If you have a your Bible and one of the turning to John chapter six that's where we're going to start this morning John chapter six.

Conrad Harkrider  00:22
What a blessing it is to be together on the first day of the week, beautiful weather, and to have so many here. It's encouraging to be with brothers and sisters, to sing, to study to worship together. If you've ever spent any time in the Smoky Mountains in East Tennessee, whether you were going on a hike or driving through the National Park, there's a decent chance that you have come across a black bear. The sightings are fairly common. A couple of years ago, we were doing some hiking and I was in the really want to see a black bear camp and my wife was in the really don't want to see a black bear camp. And she told me that if we came across one, that I could stop and hang out with the bear, and she would head back to the car. But if you're not any real danger, that's a pretty cool experience to see one of these animals, not in a cage or at a zoo, but in their natural habitat. The one of the interesting facts about these animals is the fact that they hibernate in the wintertime. In the summer, they are consuming massive amounts of food summer and into the fall, they eat nearly 20,000 calories a day drinking two to four gallons of water. And they're storing up all of this energy so that when they get ready to go into their den and go to sleep, they can stay there for months. I'm told that bears can go without food or water for over 100 days. Now, that's over three months, I have a hard time going three hours without eating something. And yet, this is not the way that God has designed these animals. They are incredible. Our bodies require regular daily food in order to sustain and nourish our physical bodies. We can't go into hibernation and not drink any water otherwise we die. Food is essential for us. And that's what makes what Jesus says in John chapter six and verse 27. So interesting, when he talks about our appetites and our relationship to food, something that we have to have to eat to survive. This morning, I want to talk to talk about feeding your Spirit. John chapter six and verse 27. Read with me. It says, Do not labor for the food which perishes. But for the food which endures to everlasting life, which the Son of Man will give you because God the Father has set His seal on him.

Conrad Harkrider  03:19
We spend countless hours buying, preparing, eating, cleaning up after the whole process of eating food. Even if you don't do a lot of cooking, there's driving to the restaurant and waiting in line. And then there's the expense, the amount of money that we spend to purchase and feed ourselves and feed our families, especially if you've got teenage boys, the amount that they can consume is significant. And God did not make us like other animals like a snake that just eats once a week and then it's good to go. We have to have regular ongoing intake of calories to sustain us. We need this food constantly. And so when the people come to Jesus just after he has fed the 5000 and John chapter six, and they are desiring to receive some type of meal from him, he tells them do not labor or work for the food that perishes, the focus the emphasis should not be on the food that you sit down at the table to eat. First of all, notice Jesus is showing them that there are two different kinds of food. There is the food that perishes and that the and then the food that is imperishable or that leads to eternal life. We know about the perishable food, right? That's the food that gets old and moldy starts to get that green, fuzzy stuff on top of it. It's perishable. It doesn't last forever, it's temporary. And when you eat that food, it goes into your body, it provides energy, and you burn it up. And then after a couple of hours, it's gone. It doesn't last for extended period of time. But there is another type of food, something that you don't find at the store, not something that is prepared in a restaurant or served by a world class chef. This is spiritual food. Look at what Jesus says in John chapter six and verse 48. And John six and 48, he says, I am the bread of life, your father is a man in the wilderness and are dead. This is the bread which comes down from heaven that one may eat of it and not die. Two different kinds of food here the man and the fathers ate in the wilderness and what happened to them they ultimately died. But there is this true bread, this bread that comes down from heaven and those who consume it will never die, they will never face death. Also, in Isaiah chapter 55, and verse one, it says, Come everyone who thirsts, come to the waters, and he who has no money come by and eat, come buy wine and milk Without money and without price? Why do you spend your money for that which is not bread and your labor and your labor for that which does not satisfy? Listen diligently to me and eat what is good and delight yourselves, enrich food. When the people came to Jesus for this true bread, he wasn't charging them anything. He wasn't collecting money. And here the writer and I hear in Isaiah the prophet says, He invites people to come without price without money. This is something that is being freely given to all this spiritual nourishment, this spiritual bread, spiritual food is necessary. Because we are more than flesh and blood, we are made up more than what we can see on the outside our skin and our bones and our physical bodies. In First Thessalonians chapter five and verse 23, Paul writes, Now may the God of peace Himself sanctify you completely, and may your whole spirit and soul and body be kept blameless at the coming of our Lord, Jesus Christ. Paul refers to different aspects here he says that we have a spirit, a soul, and a body, your spirits might be referring to your consciousness, your awareness, the way that you think and feel, your inside your soul is that eternal part of you, we are made in the image of God, and God has sent eternity in each one of us, that part of us that will go beyond this temporary life. And then your body, the part of us that we all can see and interact with, and touch and feel. But we have different aspects, different components to our body. And that's why it is necessary to feed not only our physical bodies, to focus on the outward, the external, but also to feed our spirit to feed our souls on a regular, ongoing basis. Another important truth that is presented

Conrad Harkrider  08:25
in God's word is that there is this conflict that is going on between the flesh and the spirit. There is a constant battle that is occurring between things that are physical and then things that are spiritual. In Galatians, chapter five, in verse 16, Paul talks about these two different contrasting or opposing feelings or desires. And what we see here from this text is that when it comes to desire, an appetite, the thing that you feed is ultimately what is going to grow stronger. If you feed it, it will grow. What you are placing emphasis and importance on that is ultimately going to progress and become more significant and important or stronger. Look with me in Galatians chapter five and verse 16 Galatians chapter five, and verse 16. Paul says, I say then walk in the Spirit and you shall not fulfill the lusts of the flesh, for the flesh less against the Spirit and the Spirit against the flesh and these are contrary to one another, so that you do not do the things that you wish. But if you are led by the Spirit unit, you are not under law. Now the works of the flesh are evident which are adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lewdness, idolatry, sorcery, hatred, contentions, jealousy, outbursts of wrath. selfish ambitions dissensions, heresies, envy, murderers, drunkenness, revelries, and the like, of which I tell you beforehand, just as I also told you in time past, that those who practice such things will not inherit the kingdom of God. But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, long suffering, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self control. Against such there is no law. And those who are Christ's have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires. If we live in the spirit, let us also walk in the Spirit. Paul says in verse 17, that these two natures are, oppose or contrary to one another, they are in conflict. And the point is, we cannot be engaging in that list the works of the flesh, and also walking in the Spirit, those two things are going in different directions, they're going in the opposite way. If we feed our spirit and our desire and passion for God, then that's what's going to increase. That's what we see in Acts chapter two, the word is proclaimed. The people they accept the message about Jesus Christ, they have all things in common, they're sharing their food together from house to house, they're growing in faith and in knowledge, they're increasing. But the same is true with our flesh. If we feed those desires, some people think with temptation and sin, it's like something that you just got to get out of your system. Like you go away for a few years, you leave home, and you just let it run its course. And then once it's all been expended, then you can come back and start to settle down. But that's not the way it works. loss leads to more lust, jealousy leads to more jealousy, these things grow and continue and they build on one another. And so we have to do if we're going to put away these things, what Paul says in verse 24, he says that we have to crucify the flesh, completely, put it away, put it to death, and then feed the spirits, whatever you are feeding that is ultimately what is going to grow. So how do we get this spiritual nourishment? How do we receive this spiritual strength, we can't survive, or grow without it. spiritual nourishment is absolutely vital, it is essential for us not just something that might be a nice to have, or something that would be good to add on to a already great life, we cannot survive without it. In First Peter chapter two, and verse two, it says, like newborn infants long for the pure spiritual milk, that by it, you may grow up into salvation, if indeed you have tasted that the Lord is good. We are too long for the spiritual milk. And this allows us to ultimately grow into salvation.

Conrad Harkrider  13:22
When a baby is born, they're not just they're born, and we say how nice, let's just put them over here and then wait for them to grow up into mature adults. There's a lot that has to happen in between birth, and then when they grow to maturity, they have to be fed, they have to be taken care of, they have to be nurtured. And ultimately, that allows them to gain that strength to grow into into an into an adult. And in the same way, we don't just come to Christ, or baptize we believe and then that's it. We're just waiting for heaven. We have to continue to progress. And in order to do that, we've got to feed on the spiritual milk. When we think about spiritual nourishment, and the sources of where that comes from, first of all, notice that there has to be a strong desire. There has to be a, an appetite for spiritual food. If you've been around any babies lately, they don't just politely ask for the milk when they're hungry. It's not something that can be put off, you can't reason with them and say, Well, you know, could you just wait a couple more hours or maybe even a few days, or, you know, is there let me finish what I'm doing over here and then I'll get around to it. They're going to let you know. It's something that they have to have. And it's a desire within them that until it's satisfied, there's continual craving, and pursuing for that nourishment. And so the question is for us, do we feel that same way about spiritual food? Do we think more about physical food than we do about the spiritual milk that comes from God? Is that something that is constantly on our minds around the clock regular, ongoing, that we have this passionate desire and longing for that for that spiritual nourishment? Look with me in Colossians chapter one and verse nine Colossians chapter one and verse nine is Paul's talking about growth and progressing in faith. He gives a number of things that we can do in order to receive this type of feeding Colossians chapter one and verse nine.

Conrad Harkrider  15:56
He says, For this reason, we also since the day we heard it, do not cease to pray for you and to ask that you may be filled with the knowledge of his will, in all wisdom and spiritual understanding. Verse nine says that in order to receive spiritual nourishment, we've got to be filled with knowledge. That's what we do in Bible study, we are seeking to gain wisdom and insight from God's word. What we hold in our hands is not just a good collection of stories, and wise sayings. This is the this is the mind of God that has been revealed to us. It gives us insight, it gives us perspective, it helps us to understand what this life is all about why we're here, the direction that we're supposed to be headed, how we're supposed to live in this world. It gives us knowledge and understanding. Also, look at verse 10, that you may walk worthy of the Lord fully pleasing Him, being fruitful and every good work and increasing in the knowledge of God. We also are to walk worthy, walk in a worthy manner. growing spiritually is more than just learning about facts and figures. It's more than an academic exercise. If you read a book about painting, does that make you a great artist? Spiritual Growth cannot happen. Until we put these things into practice in our own lives. It requires diligence, it requires time it requires practice, on an ongoing, consistent basis. We don't just read Galatians chapter five, and then all the sudden we become people who exhibit love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, the fruit of the Spirit. These are things that have to be put into action. Where we show love, in our relationships, we express joy during times of difficulty or uncertainty. We have peace and confidence in God that he's going to take care of us. We show patients in situations where we're being tested or when things aren't going our way. All these things are being manifested in our life, and that helps us to grow to maturity. Look at verse 11. He says, strengthened with all mine according to his glorious power, not according to his glorious power for all patients and long suffering with joy. We are to be strengthened in power. When you think about spiritual growth, a lot of times we put the emphasis on ourselves. We think about all the things that we need to be doing. But don't miss this point. Here. Paul says that we are to be filled and strengthened with the power of God. If we tried to do this on our own, we're only going to get so far. Not until we surrender our desires and trust ourselves to God and rely on his strength to fill us. Can we move past our sin? Can we move past our weaknesses? It's like trying to lift a concrete block that is sitting there to lift it by yourself. When there is a giant crane sitting in the background, using the power of God relying on him turning to him for our source of strength and renewal. Also in verse 11. He says that we are to exhibit patience or endurance and long suffering with joy. We are to endure with patients. Going through something that is challenging is not something that we often desire asked for pray for. But these are times and periods of our life where we can experience rapid spiritual progress, progress and growth. So talking to some friends recently, and they had experienced a an illness with a child a serious illness. And it was a very traumatic ordeal for them to go through that and have to deal with it. But the remark that they made after going through the the treatments and the surgeries and everything, they said that they had never in their life prayed as much as they had during that time period. These things cause us to draw near to God too long for him, to search after him. Where we really feel like we need the Lord, we rely on him to continue on. And then in verse 12, he says, giving thanks to the Father, who has qualified us to be partakers of the inheritance of the saints in the light, we are to give thanks to God, we receive spiritual feeding and nourishment when we honor and recognize God. Giving thanks should be a regular part of our attitude of our lives, where we look to God and we see that he is the source of blessings that He is responsible for our salvation. The people that we are today they accomplish, the accomplishments that we've had, the things we've been able to do all that is because of what God is doing through us giving things and recognition to the Father. And then finally, this should be a daily feeding. We think about physical nourishment. It's not hard for us to get on a regular schedule with that breakfast, lunch and dinner, we're always thinking about food. If we happen to forget our stomachs, or our blood sugar reminds us we start to feel weak, or lightheaded, or dizzy or whatever it may be.

Conrad Harkrider  22:04
But the challenge is to start to develop that same sense of hunger and desire for the Word of God, for the spiritual feeding that God offers to exhibit these things on a regular basis, walking in his ways, being strengthened with his might, enduring through difficulties and challenges, and then giving things to the Lord so that we can receive that on an ongoing and consistent basis. In Matthew chapter four and verse four, Jesus said that man does not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of God, are we feeding on that spiritual food each day of our lives. And finally, we think about feeding our spirit. We need to realize, and and understand that this is something that provides tremendous benefit. feeding our spirit has great value. It has profit not only for this life, but also for the life to come. In Matthew chapter five and verse six. Jesus said, Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be satisfied. spiritual nourishment is so important. And it's so beneficial because ultimately, it leads to true fulfillment. Jesus said that those who are hungry and thirsting for these things will be filled, they will be satisfied. And that's what spiritual nourishment offers us. Think about the last time that you had a really big meal. Maybe it was a special occasion or a birthday or some type of family get together. And you ate so much. You felt like you can take another bite. Even if someone brought out the world's best steak or your favorite dessert, you'd have to say I can't take another another piece. But how long does that feeling last? A couple of minutes, few hours, maybe to the next day where we just really feel that sense of being full, like we can't have any more. This food ultimately, it goes away that feeling of satisfaction and fulfillment is short term. And by the next morning of the next day, we're in need of more we have to go out and get more food. And that's a problem with making our life about things that are physical, whether it be food or any other number of earthly things that people are hungering and thirsting after. There are all kinds of desires that people are trying to fill up their lives to give them that sense of peace and satisfaction. In this World. I was talking to a nurse recently. And she said that the number of people that are showing up in the emergency room because of overdose, it's increasing at an alarming rate. And many times these people that they're not even brought in by friends or family, they'll just be dropped off at the door, taken in to receive care. And what's disheartening about this, as many times these people after they receive treatments, and they are stabilized, and they're released from the hospital, it's not, but a few weeks, and they're back in the same place. constantly going back to something that ultimately doesn't satisfy us. And that doesn't have to be drugs, it could be sexual sin, or it could be finding our fulfillment in money, or a relationship or a job or whatever it may be. But looking for peace and contentment in the wrong places. spiritual food satisfies us at the deepest level. In Psalm chapter in Psalm 107, in verse nine, speaking about God, it says, For He satisfies the longing soul, and the hungry soul, he fills with good things. God is the only one who can fill us up. That sense of void that each of us has that longing, that purpose that we're looking for. He is the only one that can provide that. Also, notice in John chapter four, and verse 10, is Jesus is speaking to the Samaritan woman at the well. John chapter four. And verse 10.

Conrad Harkrider  26:47
John, For in verse 10, Jesus answered and said to her, if you knew the gift of God, and who it was, and who it is that says to you give me a drink, you would have asked him, and he would have given you living water, giving the verse 13, Jesus answered and said to her, whoever drinks of this water will thirst again, but whoever drinks of the water that I shall give to him will never thirst. But the water that I shall give will become in him a fountain of water springing up into everlasting life. This woman, she's going down to the well, constantly, she's drawing out water, and Jesus says, if you get the water that I have to offer, you're never going to thirst, you're never going to desire to drink again. And this is an in a spiritual sense, Jesus, and God offer eternal blessings, the bread that comes from heaven, this life giving water that produces a spring, within our hearts, and our souls. It allows us to have something that goes on for eternity. There's nothing in this world that compares to that. This body is one day going to, it's going to give out no matter how young you feel, and how in shape you are and how healthy your diet is, and how much exercise you get all of us one day are going to die. This world is passing away. Then the question is how much time and energy and emphasis are we putting on the things that are temporary, that are just here for a short period of time? When you go on a camping trip, what type of provisions do you make for your tent? Maybe you put a rain cover over the top so you don't get wet. Maybe you put a mattress on the bottom so it's a little more comfortable. Maybe you secure it to the ground so that if there's a storm it doesn't blow away. But do we run pipe underneath that tent so we can have running water plumbing? Do we send wires out to there so we can install lights and electricity? Do we pour concrete around that area so that we can have a place to park our car that's ridiculous. It's a tent. And in most cases you don't even own that piece of land. It's something that is only intended to be there for a short period of time. Are we putting too much emphasis on the tent on the physical on the part of life that James says appears for a little time as a vapor and then vanishes away. Second Corinthians chapter five and verse one says For we know that if this tent for we know that If the 10 that is our earthly home is destroyed, we have a building from God a house not made with hands eternal in the heavens. When we focus on spiritual nourishment and the spiritual body, it doesn't matter what happens in this world doesn't matter if we suffer we face disease, disappointment, loss or even death. Because we have a building and foundation from God that can't be touched a treasure and an inheritance that can never be taken away or destroyed. This morning, we're going to conclude with a song and we use that as an opportunity to encourage those who are here in your walk with Christ to begin a new life, serving the Lord if there's something that we can do to help you to support you. In your relationship with him, please come down to the front as we stayed in sin
