Unknown Speaker  00:00
Good evening. More than 35 years ago, I was in the finishing up the training program that I was in in Indiana, when Cindy and I married. And the elders were trying to push me out of the nest. And we to their pleasure had finally arranged to go to the first congregation to try out or get acquainted or whatever you want to call it. And after dinner on Saturday night, the people we were staying with oh, by the way, we want you to teach the Bible class in the morning. And that's, that's fine. I brought an extra lesson with me, oh, no, we want you to pick up where we left off. And so and so letter book. And, of course, this brother and sister had no books. And, of course, I didn't bring a library with me. And we didn't have computers and software back then. And so it was, it was nerve racking. I remember very well, though, when people were leaving on Sunday morning, the brother that stood there the longest, and talk to me, and maybe talk the loudest as well, and said, your sermon was okay. But your Bible class was a lot better. I've never gotten away from that comment. And so whenever a church will let me teach a Bible class rather than preach, I almost always go for a Bible class format, I hope that you received a handout. And if you did not, if you'll raise your hand, I'm sure there's someone here that knows where the handouts are, and can get you one. I did not know my wife was going to be with me. So I did not think to give her one. So she has her hand up with some others. As being passed out, I'll say to you that of the Pentateuch, the first five books of the Old Testament, I rotate in my thoughts about witches, my favorite at any particular time, Leviticus, as you might expect, doesn't come up to the top quite as much as maybe Genesis would. But two or three years ago, and my Bible readings, I spent one month in the Book of Leviticus and had a fantastic month. There are a lot of really neat things there. But I think probably most of us if we have have read through the books of Moses very much, we found ourselves, especially drawn to Deuteronomy, after having read through Leviticus. Why is it that we prefer Deuteronomy? What do we find it refreshing? Any thoughts? Why is Deuteronomy called Deuteronomy? Yes, second law. Remember, the Israelites did not enter the Promised Land 40 years before, when they could have they believed, or they they were influenced by the 10, unbelieving spies rather than by Joshua and Caleb. And consequently, they had to wonder that 40 years and what happened during the 40 years who died, a whole generation died. And it was the generation of adults who had heard the law presented when Moses first presented it at Sinai. That generation has died, those that were under the age of 20. When they left Egypt, and those born during the wilderness period, they are now going to enter the land. And so God has Moses present the law a second time, and thus it's Deuteronomy, the second giving of the law. But when Moses presents the law the second time, he emphasizes some things that were really crucial in there being more faithful and obedient than they had been initially after having assured God that they were going to obey the law.

Unknown Speaker  04:56
And so some have called the Book of Deuteronomy, the At the heart of the law, because Deuteronomy talks so much even as some of the passages we will read tonight, talk so much about the place of the heart, and truly obeying God over and over we have the word heart used in Deuteronomy. And in certain expressions related to the heart use repeatedly, like with all your heart. The heart is really important. The Book of Deuteronomy doesn't use the term faith, not much anyway, or that concept. And yet the concept is there. It's it's found again, and again, for those that want to look for it. Unfortunately, today, and in a in a Calvinistic setting, it seems to me that Deuteronomy is is law, and therefore its its act often not accorded the respect it ought to have. But I want to suggest to you that in Deuteronomy, the heart of the law, we ought to learn a lot about how we ought to approach God's instructions to us through Jesus Christ. And so that's what I want to talk to you about tonight, as we talk about the compliance, that counts things that accompany the obedience that pleases God. We'll be looking at passages throughout Deuteronomy, but especially Deuteronomy, chapter six. So let's read this chapter. Deuteronomy, chapter six. And Mr. Roy, would you like to begin reading and you can just read as far as you want to, of course, very loudly. And then when you have read as far as you want to you call on someone else to read and we'll see if they've been keeping up.

Unknown Speaker  07:18
chapter six, verse one. Now this is the commandment, the statutes and judgments because the Lord your God has commanded me to teach you that you might do them in the land where you're going over to possessing so that you and your son and your grandson might fear the Lord God to keep all his MCN protected managing all of these new laws that can basically be

Unknown Speaker  07:38
prolonged so it's really interesting that you can do that it may be well with you make you

Unknown Speaker  07:45
a multiply greatly systems working on your daughter's as promised you in a land flowing with milk and honey. Here, O Israel, the LORD our God the Lord is One You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul with all your mind. These words reside commanding you today shall be on your heart. You shall teach them diligently to yourself to shall talk with them and you sit in the house, when you walk by the way, when you lie down, when you rise up, you shall bind them as a sign of your hands and they shall be as frontlets on your forehead, you shall write them on the doorposts of your house and on your case, it shall come about the Lord your God brings me to the land which he swore to your fathers, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob give you greatness one to two did not build and houses full of all good things if you do not fail. In human systems wish you did not dig vineyards and olive tree in which you did not plant you eat and are satisfied. Then watch yourself and do not forget the Lord who brought you from the land of Egypt and the house of slavery. You shall fear only the Lord your God, You shall worship him. It's whereby his name, you shall not follow other gods and goddesses around you to the Lord your God is in the midst of beautiful vistas you have jealous God, otherwise, the anger of the LORD your God will be kindled against you. And people want to offer things from the Earth. You have already gone to the test and you test them and NASA shall diligently keep the commandments of Lord your God, and His testimonies and his statutes which He has commanded you. You shall do what is right, and good in the sight of the Lord, that may be wrapped with you, and that you may go in and possess and remove land which the Lord swore to give your father by broadening out all humanity for you as a luminous token, when your son asked me to come saying what did the testimonies in the statutes and get into me with the Lord our God for managing them you shall say to your son, we were slaves to Pharaoh in Egypt, and the more balls from Egypt and the mighty hand. Moreover, the Lord showed great and distressing time wise before our eyes against the Federal Council. Have you brought us out from there in order to bring us in to give us the language he has wanted in response to the Lord commanded us to observe all the statues to fear the Lord our God for our being all witches, and for our survival as it is today. It will be righteousness for us if we aren't careful to observe all this commandment before and more about just as you demand.

Unknown Speaker  10:23
And there was a collective sigh, that he didn't stop and call on anyone got a line and looked up the word obedience. And the first definition, well, they didn't change much from it as I looked at more. Many definitions use the word compliance, its compliance with the will or instructions of another, especially someone in authority, compliance, but does the fact that someone complies with instructions God gave mean that they're pleasing to God when they do so. Sometimes, people act like that. The word legalism is thrown around a lot. But to me that is one of the clearest forms of legalism is when someone thinks that that merely because they comply, that God has to be pleased. But when I read chapters like Deuteronomy, chapter six, or the whole book of Deuteronomy, I realized there's a lot more to pleasing God than simply comply. There's some things that need to accompany our compliance. In an age in which obedience to God and His Word are often downplayed. What stands out for you at the very beginning and end of Deuteronomy six for those of you that that prepared ahead of time? That's question number one. Look at verse three, especially in verse 25. What stands out for you there? Yes, Kevin. Be careful. Be careful, the new the English Standard. And some others say be careful, anything else stand out for you, their obedience is downplayed. But Moses said, Be careful to do what to do or to observe, to observe. All that's the little word I was looking for, to be careful to observe to do all that the Lord has commanded. Does this sound like? Obedience isn't a big deal to the Lord? Not at all. I don't know. And as you go through the book of Deuteronomy, versions, like the English Standard Version, will use the word Careful 26 times often using the word all all his commands, all His statutes, all his rules. 24 of those 26 times that the word careful is used in the ESV. It's used, specifically referring to the instructions that God had given Deuteronomy 12. Someone like to read verse 28, to his place.

Unknown Speaker  13:56
Be careful to obey all these words that I conveyed, that it may go well with you and with your children, after you forever, when you do what is good, and right in the sight of the Lord your God.

Unknown Speaker  14:11
What do I see that expression, that it may go well, or for your good? Again and again, in Deuteronomy connected with their carefully obeying what the Lord has said, then I don't want to talk about five things. And you could probably pick out at least that many more but five things that stand out, especially in chapter six, though they're mentioned throughout Deuteronomy, that ought to accompany compliance with God's word that God would consider it obedience to Him. In verses three and four of Deuteronomy six what command is repeated? Yeah, hear or listen, the, the Hebrew word there and I know less about even less about Hebrew than I do Greek. But I clicked one of those pronunciation buttons on the internet and it said Shall man, I believe is how it pronounced the Hebrew word there for, for here it's used like 1200 times in the Old Testament. And a lot of those times it just means here and in all kinds of contexts, but in many, many contexts, it's it's hearing that is associated with obedience so the King James version will often translate it Harken take heed. Turn to Deuteronomy five verse one. In Deuteronomy five we have Moses repetition of the 10 commandments. And notice how the chapter begins. Someone read chapter five verse one for us, Jamie, you want to read that?

Unknown Speaker  16:25
The statutes and ordinances which I'm speaking today for hearing, that you might learn them and observe them carefully?

Unknown Speaker  16:32
Yes. Moses is getting ready to present the 10 commandments again, and he says, Hero Israel, here, and he is here so that you can be careful to do them hearing and obeying go together. And consequently, like 80, or 90 of all those times that this Hebrew word is used in the the Old Testament, it is translated obey or obedience, something like that. For instance, Deuteronomy four verse 30, uses the very same verb, the word but now instead of saying here, the translators, almost virtually every English version, translated obey, obey his voice.

Unknown Speaker  17:36
In Deuteronomy 11, Moses will introduce this idea of blessings and cursing, curses. That's going to become a major aspect of the very end of, of Deuteronomy, of course, about Deuteronomy 28 and 29, as he will, by inspiration list, many of the blessings and many of the curses and if I understand what may be the verse we know best in Deuteronomy, Deuteronomy 2929. Can somebody tell me what that says? Yeah, the sacred things belong to the Lord. If I understand that verse, we use it very generally, the borrowing the principle, but I think what he's saying is, people I've I've listed from God, I've listed a lot of blessings if you obey God, and I've listed a lot of curses, things that will happen if you disobey God. But actually, there are a lot more of each, a lot more. There's a lot more blessings that are named for those that obey the Lord. There are a lot more curses that are named for those that disobey Lord, the sacred things belong to God. But the things that are revealed the blessings and curses that are listed along with all God's instructions, they the things that are revealed are revealed so that you can obey the Lord your God. Notice chapter 11, when he first introduces this idea, do Deuteronomy 1126 through 28.

Unknown Speaker  19:33
See, I'm saying for you today a blessing and a curse, a blessing if you obey the commandments of the Lord your God, your second baby today, and the curse if you do not obey the commandments of the Lord our God, but turn aside from the way that I met you today to go out.

Unknown Speaker  19:54
Yes, when verse 26 talks about obey the commandments of the Lord and verse A 28 talks about if you do not obey the commandments, obey in both cases is that same word that we have in chapter six, verses three and four here. Hearing listening to the Lord and obeying are inseparably linked? Can we obey the Lord, if we do not listen to him? There's a mere fact that someone thinks that they want to obey God. Make it where they, they can, even if, if they're ignorant of what he wants. Many people today seem to think so that the sincerity is all that matters. But the Lord says here, here, and hearing includes this idea of obeying when people do not listen to God, how do they tend to act? That's Question three. presumptuously. What's another word that you use? They're rebel. Yeah. And you, you have that in in chapter one. And then you have it again in chapter 17, in relation to the proclamations of the priests and the judges among the people. People that don't listen, our law likely to presume. And God doesn't want us to presume he wants us to do his what His will actually is not just what we might imagine it to be. In chapter one, verse 43. What situation in their past was he referring to when he talked about them presuming acting presumptuously? Very briefly referred to it earlier in the introduction. Or actually, I referred to the backstory of it, Terry. They didn't listen to the spies. And so God says, For every day, this, they didn't listen to Joshua and Caleb, the faithful spies. And so God says, For every day, the spies were in the land. What are the people going to have to do? spend a year in the wilderness, so 40 years in the wilderness, but after God says that, what are the people do then are many of them? They want to run the clock back, don't think. And so now, even though Moses tells them you cannot go, you've got to stay in the wilderness, you will receive the land. Some of them presumed to go up the book of Numbers tells us and it tells how God punished them for doing so. And so in Deuteronomy, chapter one, Moses, God has Moses remind the people of that, that they need to be sure to hear to listen to the Lord, rather than to act presumptuously. Like the previous generation had done. If God says, go, you go, if God says, Don't go, you refrain from going, you need to hear the Lord, if you would obey Him. Obedience is a word that isn't really high in the, the favorite words of our society, by any means. And I just haven't come up on this this little graph showing in literature. Supposedly, They've tracked the use of the word obedience over time. And notice how much less obedience is discussed than it has been in the past. But God wants us to obey Him and the very first thing that we need to realize is that he would have us here him I wanted to spend the most time on this point. In Luke chapter eight, Jesus I suppose the Holy Spirit puts together three little there's bound to be a word for it. There Three little things you've got, you've got a parable, and its explanation. And then you've got an illustration. And then you have an account of something that happened. And all of them are about taking heed to how you hear. What's the parable?

Unknown Speaker  25:25
Yeah, the parable of the sower. And so he talks about four approaches to listening to the Lord. Some people have hard hearts, they won't listen at all. Some people have those stony ground hearts, they believe quickly, but then their faith dies quickly to when, when difficulty comes along. And then you've got that thorny soul, the cares and riches of the world. And then then they're the people with the good hearts, that really listen. And in explaining the parable, Jesus emphasizes, He that has ears to hear, take key, how you listen, what is the illustration it's an illustration that we're familiar with, but not in this context. Because Jesus is an illustration Jesus loved and used it in three or four different contexts, at least. In this case, he uses it regarding hearing, the in look at the the illustration he uses is of lighting a lamp. When someone likes the lamp, where does he put it, he puts it on the candle stick, he doesn't put it under the bed or, or hide it in some other way. Hiding it in this case, meaning preventing the shining of its light. The light of God's word is to illuminate our lives, is to expose what needs to be changed. It's, it's to help us see how we really are help us examine ourselves. And so you don't put the light of God's Word where it can't shine on your heart and life. You put it on the candlestick. And then you have Jesus teaching. And the Holy Spirit puts all these together, Luke, Timothy Johnson, and his commentary on Luke says that often in Luke, where something is said is as important as what is said. And Jesus probably didn't say these three things all on the same occasion. But the Holy Spirit has Luke put them together to really emphasize the importance of hearing and hearing properly. Jesus's teaching. And as he's teaching, some people come to Him and who did they tell him? is wanting to see him? Yeah, as mothers and his mother and his brother's I suppose they, they have this notion? Well, his mother and brothers are really close to him. And of course, he'll want to take a break and go talk to them. But what does Jesus say instead?

Unknown Speaker  28:35
Yeah, the person who hears God's word and puts it into practice, those are my mother, and my brother, and my sister. The people had the closest relationship with the Lord, whether they share his blood or not. The people that have the closest relationship with Him, are the ones who hear him with a mind to obey. Who has your ear? Has your ear that's what we need to be thinking about. I said that there were four other points so we better get moving. Look at verse five of Deuteronomy six what what are the people commanded to do in verse five?

Unknown Speaker  29:27
Yes, they're to love the Lord. Love the Lord and how does he describe that love the Lord with all your heart with all your soul and with all your might know those words sound very familiar why? Yeah, Jesus speaks them in the New Testament and and leaders among the Jews will speak them as well at times. What does Jesus say of that command? is the first and greatest commandment in Matthew 22, verse 40, he says that, that all the Law and the Prophets depend on that and, and that and the second commandment, love your neighbor as yourself. If we want to obey the Lord, we can't just comply. He insists that we love him. What does it mean to love Him with all our heart?

Unknown Speaker  30:33
I'll give you a hint. The Bible talks a lot about our hearts. And it often talks about what the heart does. And it connects a lot of verbs with with the heart thinking, understanding, imagining knowing what aspect of our our B does those things? The brain the intellect, yeah. And then we've got planning and intending was that it's the will Yeah. And, and desiring and feeling was that emotions. And so often the heart has been defined as the, the intellect, the will, and the emotions the Lord wants us to use all of these faculties in our loving him with whom does God keep covenant according to chapter seven of Deuteronomy, verse nine. Yeah, those who love Him and keep His commandments and and so we have that expression again and again in Deuteronomy, along with loving the Lord with all your heart, and soul, our heart and soul and my touches, Deuteronomy 13, one through three. But that doesn't just happen. We, it takes a special person, to love the Lord with all their being. In chapter 30, verse six, what has to occur before a person can obey the Lord with all her heart and soul?

Unknown Speaker  32:43
Trust in God,

Unknown Speaker  32:46
yes. What did What did Moses say the Lord would do so that they could do so that they could love Him, serve Him with their heart. Yeah, he was going to circumcise their hearts. Now, so many things that the Bible tells us to do. We're encouraged because it also tells us that's what God wants to do. And that's the case here. In in chapter 10, verse 16, Moses had commanded the people to circumcise their hearts. What does that mean?

Unknown Speaker  33:31
What did Steven say to to those that would stone him in Acts 751. You stiff necked and uncircumcised in heart, and ears, you always resist the Holy Spirit is between four or five loaves we quote that verse.

Unknown Speaker  33:58
If your ears are stopped up, you can't hear. And if your heart is hard and calloused, it cannot respond to the Lord in a way, even if it complies, it won't please the Lord. The Lord wants this tender heart, as Kevin pointed out, this this heart that responds to God. And so the Bible, in the prophets will talk about Jeremiah four verse four will talk about you need to circumcise your hearts, sadly enough just to circumcise the flesh, and in Romans 228 and 29. The true Jew is not the one that circumcised in the flesh only. But the true Jews were those Jews that were circumcised of heart and their praise was not of men, but of God. There's a lot of wordplay going on. there. But the idea is, we have to cooperate with God in this work of everything being removed that would keep God from being the object of our adoration, effect and affection that would keep God from being served with our whole heart. Any comments about that? That things to add that we need to hear the Lord, we need to love the Lord. And then in back in Deuteronomy, chapter six, in verses six through nine, what else were the people commanded to do?

Unknown Speaker  35:53
Yes, in verse six, he says, to teach God's instructions diligently and talk of them. Verse nine, what were they to do? Yeah, right there on the doorposts. and on your gates. And so it appears he definitely wants them to teach their family, their children. But the door posts in the gates implies is to go beyond that, that gas and passers by those around them there to share God's word. And that's, that's the third point that we need to, to hear the Lord. We need to love the Lord. And we need to share the Lord and the things of the Lord, if we would, in complying with instructions truly be obeying him turned to Deuteronomy 32.

Unknown Speaker  36:55
Even before Deuteronomy six as early, at least as Deuteronomy four, the Lord was telling them, commanding them to talk, to share to tell. And then we find not only at the beginning, but now at the end of Deuteronomy, Deuteronomy 3245, and 46. What are those verses say?

Unknown Speaker  37:25
Moses, thinking all these words, while Israel said to them, take to heart, all the words by which I'm warning you today. If you make a man that your children will then be careful to do all the words of this

Unknown Speaker  37:39
law. Yes. And so the book begins and ends with this command to hear what I've said to you from God, and you be able if you'd be willing to share that with others. In chapter six, verse 20, what situation were they to be ready for? When the children ask a question, and what is the question? What are these things? What do these things mean? And we immediately think in terms of explain the command, but in what follows that's not all. The idea is when the when the children ask, what do these commands mean? What are they to tell their children? You know, what their situation had been, and what God had done. We need to be ready. Don't wait. We need to be ready. What's the New Testament passage that speaks in those terms? Yeah, first Peter three, verse 15. We need to be ready to give an answer to everyone that asked for a reason for the hope that is within us. And that's in a context of, of suffering. Why do you have hope? When it seems like everything in your life is falling apart? What does this mean? And we explain where we were, apart from God, and what we have in Christ Jesus. And then in verses 21 through 23 of chapter six, what were they to share? Beside God's commands? We've kind of let that cat out of the bag, but notice how it's repeated. What were they to share besides God's commands?

Unknown Speaker  39:53
what God had done what God had done, especially how he had rescued them from slavery, do Jesus goes to the region of the garrison scenes. And there's that man with the evil spirits, and Jesus cast them out. And the man afterwards wants to follow Jesus everywhere Jesus goes. Jesus said, No, you need to go home. Do you remember what Jesus said he needed to go home to do? Go home, and tell your friend, friends and family, what great things God has done for you, and how he has shown you His mercy. One of the saddest things that can happen to us as God's people is for us to react to the religious world around us, and be sometimes more influenced by that reaction, rather than then by our response to his work. We will hear about those around this testifying. And sometimes we want to get as far away from that as we can. But that's exactly what we need to do. We need to tell what great things God has done for us, and what it's been to receive His mercy, we need to share. And then we need to remember in verses 10, through 12, of chapter six, this is question number 10. When the Israelites settled in the Promised Land, and they began enjoying the blessings, God would provide them there. What did they need to be careful not to do? And to forget the Lord to forget their need for the Lord. And that theme of not forgetting but instead of remembering becomes one that goes all the way through the book of Deuteronomy, and chapter five, verse 15, on the Sabbath day, what did they need to remember?

Unknown Speaker  42:20
Yeah, that they were slaves. When we think of the Sabbath day, and the 10 commandments, the resting on the seventh day, what usually comes to mind? Yeah, creation, and specifically God's creation of the world, that in six days, God made everything and on the seventh day God rested. But when Moses gives the 10 commandments the second time, he doesn't mention the creation of the world. But in effect, he mentions the creation of Israel. And he reminds them that you were slaves. You were powerless. You could not redeem yourselves. But God did it for you. Or did he do it with? Yeah, an outstretched arm and a mighty hand. That's grace. It's Grace. And when we look back, and we think about how lost we were, and how saved we are now, those of us who are in Christ Jesus, let's, let's remember, we were slaves. Let's remember that the Lord with an outstretched arm and a mighty hand, redeemed us, and let's give him all the glory. Let's give him all the credit. And last of all, if we want our compliance to be true obedience, it needs to be accompanied by fear. There's remember and there's fear. The Lord is gracious, but also demanding, he's merciful, but also jealous. And so chapter six, verse two, chapter six, verse 13, chapter six, verse 24, and numerous passages before and after, emphasize that if they were going to please God, they would have to fear him. Deuteronomy says a lot about fear. chapter one, chapter three, chapter seven, chapter 20, at cetera, et cetera, talk about the fear of others. Over and over God through Moses tells the Israelites when you go into the land, you do not fear them. You do not fear, you do not fear and what is the antidote to the fear of man? The fear of God if you're struggling with fear of Man, you need to get in touch with who the Lord is, and your fear for him. That's the best antidote. Over and over in in Deuteronomy, we have these phrases here, and fear and learn to fear. Turn to chapter 31. And then we'll conclude Deuteronomy chapter 31.

Unknown Speaker  45:41
Deuteronomy chapter 31, verse six, and the Lord will give them over to you speaking of the people of the land, and you shall do to them according That's verse five. You shall do according to the whole commandment that I have commanded you, verse six, Be strong and courageous, do not fear or be in dread of them for it as the Lord your God who goes with you, He will not leave you or forsake you. And then verse 12, says, assemble the people, men, women, and little ones, the sojourner within your towns that they may hear and learn to fear the Lord your God, and be careful to do all the words of this law, and that there are children who have not known it may hear and learn to fear the Lord your God, as long as you live in the land that you are going over the Jordan to possess. Is there inappropriate fear? And it's not just the fear of others. There's even inappropriate fear regarding the Lord. We need to hear and learn to fear we need
