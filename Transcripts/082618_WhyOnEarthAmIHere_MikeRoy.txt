It is always a great privilege for us to come together in worship our great and awesome God. That's why we are here, here, Jeremy say that a lot at the beginning of the lessons is that we are here to honor God to praise him to glorify Him and all that we do in the process of preaching and teaching God's word. We also seek to challenge one another to greater faith, greater trust, greater love for God, greater obedience, as we seek to do His will this morning, I want to challenge you with a really a couple of simple but profound questions. These are the questions that life is about. God made us with an amazing ability to contemplate great thoughts and ideas, to use our minds to discover the deepest issues of our existence. And let me start with this, as we scan the solar system, appreciate the songs that they read the Scripture reading this morning. There's one question I want us to focus on throughout the lesson this morning. So if I forget that or lose focus of that way behind and say might get back to the question that you're focusing on? The question is, why on earth am I here? And that's not just a philosophical question. That's a real question. And it's expressed in the Bible. And we often think about that. And I appreciate David's help and some of the slides in that little statement, you are here that helps, so that you can see where you are. So you look up that little dot, can you all see yourself, they're pretty far away. But that is a question that we want to think about. It's not a little question. And you don't want to wait to your deathbed to find the answer to this question. If you don't know why you're here, why God made you why he placed you on this earth, but to find out as soon as possible, or at least to rediscover that, in this sermon address is one of the greatest thoughts that will challenge your mind. And the answer to this question will thrill your soul? Unlike anything else that you'll experience in your life? To answer this question, this morning, I'm going to be looking at it and a few verses in Psalms chapter one in Psalms chapter eight. The text that we've been studying recently in Trevor's class, and Wednesday night, and I want to suggest at the beginning of this lesson, that meditation is the key to life in so many ways, number one, meditating on the Word of God, and also meditating on God's vast and complex world that he designed and created. Another passage that we will look at near the end of this lesson is in first John chapter four. But we sometimes joke about this question, why am I here? Why did God put me here? Why am I on this earth? In fact, sometimes people say I didn't ask to be born. These are real questions. Why? Why are we here? And we'll we'll look at that. And, again, my suggests that finding the answer to this question will help you live your life with meaning, and purpose. And with joy. I put these scriptures on the screen, if you want to be looking up here, and if you can also follow along in your Bible, but the first one we're gonna go back to again, we've been studying recently on at least on Wednesday night, some of the Psalms and great study for us. In Psalm chapter one gives some great instruction advice for all of us to follow, says, Blessed is the man who walks not in the counsel of the wicked, nor stands in the way of sinners, nor sits in the seat of scoffers, but his delight is in the law of the Lord. And on his law, he meditates day and night. And again, as we learned from our study that God wants to bless us, he wants to reward us with reward us with the highest level of human happiness, joy, and satisfaction. But the psalmist says, telling us that this supreme blessedness has given only to those who fit the character of verses one and two, we do not do not walk in accounts of the wicked, or stand in the way of the sinners, nor sit in a seat of scoffers. But the message you look at this for just a moment, what is being stressed over here? The godly man in verse two is one who delights in the law of the Lord. What is it that you delight in or get excited about? Is it sports, making money? Having a nice home, the latest car and technology, the godly man that God blesses is one who is excited about God's word. The

Mike Roy  04:39
truth of the matter is studying God's word is the most exciting activity that you can engage in. It gives you the knowledge of the Holy One and the hope of heaven. So the godly man is one who delights in the law of the Lord. Again, we realize and I think we understand that we need law God knew that And I think we need we understand that God has given us law in such a way that we can learn how to live, how to work, how to conduct our business and worship God. And knowing God brings the greatest satisfaction that you can experience, knowing, loving Him and OBEYING His will. But the other key here so this godly man delights in law of the Lord says on his law, he meditates is a word that comes up over and over in Scripture. And meditation, unfortunately, unfortunately, is a lost art in our country. Some of you no doubt, may do a very good job about your meditation, Baba meditation. But I think for most of us, we do not do the good job that we should be doing. What does it mean to meditate on God's word, it means to ponder, to think about soberly are to dwell on the words, the promises, the warnings to commands of Scripture. And Bible meditation involves time it involves a deliberate activity, a place to do that, it's a choice that we make. So I want to suggest to you is in the kind of the first part of this lesson at the head of the book of Psalms is the message of the urgency of meditating on God's word. This, in some ways, is kind of why God created us why God gave us the ability to think, to reason to study, to analyze, to do all that stuff. So in terms of our existence, He created us with this ability to get to meditate on His Word, and even to contemplate his creation. We'll talk about that. In just a moment, I was listening to one preachers routine as he's gotten older life, he said, and he's spending more time in meditation, he'll get up he said about 530 in the morning, and begins his walk in the first thing he begins to do is spend time in prayer to God. And then he kind of contemplate scripture that we've been thinking about, and Baba classes or sermons, and runs them over in his mind, then he might be thinking about some upcoming sermons he's gonna ride or articles he's going to write. The point here is that meditation is something that we need to give a higher priority to. And so the book Think about this, the first really message it's a book of Psalms, one of the largest books in the Bible, speaks to the issue of meditating on God's word, and then the phrase that we kind of almost dismiss that this person delights in the law of the Lord and meditates on it day and night. And I understand that we don't 24/7 Heaven knows in the Bible, but but on a continual basis with thinking about and considering God's law. So I want to suggest to us in terms of how God made us, he designed us with this ability to meditate on Him, His power, His holiness, His love, His purity, and certainly his word, and also his creation. And we learned so much from Matt, the second verse, chapter that I want to really focus on in Psalms chapter eight, with the question, why on earth, we're raising the questions point of why am I here? Why did God placed me on this earth? It's a real question. You know, what, what are we doing here? When

Mike Roy  08:23
we think about the vastness of God's creation? So look at Psalms chapter eight and verse, verse one says, oh, Lord, our Lord, how majestic is your name and all the earth, you have set your glory above the heavens, out of the mouth of babies and infants, you have established strength because of your foes to steal the enemy. And the Avenger. When I look at Your heavens, the work of Your fingers and the moon and the stars which you have set in place, what is man that You are mindful of him in the Son of man that you care for him? Yet you have made him a little lower than the heavenly beings, and crowned him with glory and honor just a couple of things I want us to, to focus on here. So in verse one, the Psalmist says that God has set or placed His glory above the heavens, if you want to see some of God's glory and power and wisdom. Look at the skies. Look at the mountains, look at the moon, look at the stars. Look at all of that God placed His glory above the heavens. But then in verse three, notice what the writer saying, perhaps this is David, I don't know for certain You see, when I look at your heavens when I consider Your heavens, the work of Your fingers, the moon and the stars, which You have set in place will just stop there for just a moment. So what the psalmist is teaching us is that this infinitely vast creation that God has put together, which is complex and woven together with precision, it can only be explained on the basis of a powerful wise maker. A powerful mind that would be God. And we realized from looking at these statements over here, that the heavens belong to God, His creation belongs to Him. It is His handiwork. It's the result of the creative power of this fingers. We again, we looked at Psalm chapter 104, this morning reminds us of God's power in creation. And when we look at the moon and the stars, we realize that he has put them in those things in place, and that this world is not a result of mindless evolution. So we understand that God is the author of human existence, it didn't just spontaneously arise out of anything out of nothing. And even cuz, you know, considered this, very often evolutionists or scientists may assume that, you know, life has no real purpose and meaning it came about by its own power, when the the scientists or the evolutionist says that that life is 20 billion years old. What is acknowledging is that it was created, it had a beginning. He didn't know who it is, but it had the beginning. So what that's one of the messages here in the book of Psalms is that in chapter eight, that God is the creator of this vast universe. So again, think about in connection with me this question, us, and our littleness, maybe why are we here, when you think about the vastness of, of our creation, just some some, some information I wanted to share with you the distance from the Earth to the Sun, I think is fairly well agreed upon is 93 million miles from the Earth to the Sun is 93 million miles from other some other resource, I'm told that the distance from the Earth to the edge of the observable universe is 46 billion light years. I want you to be thinking about this, because we're asking the question, why are we here? Why did God put us in this vast universe that cannot even be measured? And assuming these numbers are right? You may not. Because nobody's actually ever measured the universe, except God. But when you look at the vastness of the universe, it begs the question, Why? Why would God do all this? And surround us with with all of this? Again, when you think about how, how wide and how long and vastest is, and again, you look at this verse for is, the writer continues to probe that question. And you have the staggering greatness of this creation, the vastness of it, the complexity of it, the intricacy of that he raised the question, What is man, that You are mindful of him, and the son of man that you care for him? So God placed you in me? On this little cosmic ball of dust, in a vast universe, that is beyond measurement and be on comprehension? Why? Why did God place me on this earth? Why did God place you on this earth? Yet? These are real questions.

Mike Roy  13:18
Is there life on other planets? Sometimes people speculate that is, all we know is that there's life here, somebody asked and be harder than years ago, that question, do you believe that there's life on other planets and be harder than said, well, Faith comes by hearing? And I haven't heard anything from them. So that kind of a joke, but the so the question gets, why, how come? We're the only inhabited plant planet? And why did God make this complex and beautiful world? That he did, but first for kind of addressed that question. He says, what is man that You are mindful of him, the son of man that you care for him, you think about him, you take care of him in so many ways, one of the startling truths. You we understand that God makes everything everything that God has created is ultimately for His glory. But one of the reasons that God made this world and placed you in it is so that you can enjoy some of the blessings that God has given to us that we get to walk on his mountains, we get this sail on his oceans, we get to eat of the fruit trees and the vegetation, all that stuff. So in some ways, God made all of this dazzling creation for you. And for me, God didn't need that. We'll talk about that some more. But that's what the psalmist is saying, in view of the staggering greatness of creation. Why Did God surround this around me with all of this power and, and brilliance and glory and the stars and the rivers and all of that stuff? It's a humbling thought to think about when he says, What is man, that you think so much of him? And that's what I want us to think about as we looked at this question this morning. And in view of everything that God has done, verse five is also a compelling verse to consider, says, yet you have made him a little lower than the heavenly beings and crowned him with glory and honor. Why? That's the question. Why did God crowned me with glory and honor? And you in made us is insignificant creatures, just frail bags of dust? Why did he do that? Especially with with us being so insignificant. And we again think of it's a passage that we read in our Bibles class this morning, accept the 14th, when Paul was at Lister, he reminded these people that God didn't leave himself without witness, but he did good. He gave us rain from heaven and fruitful seasons, satisfying our hearts with food and gladness, he did all that for you, the lilies of the valley, the food, the rivers, the mountains for us to enjoy, and to enjoy and appreciate and ultimately, they all have like an arrow pointing us to God, they remind us that He is the Creator of all these things. In First Timothy chapter six verses in verse 17, Paul told Timothy to instruct those who are rich in this present world, not to be conceited, or to fix their hope on the uncertainty of riches, but on God who ritually supplies us with all things to enjoy. God made this creation, at least in some way. For you. I mean, doesn't that like, knock your feet out? New? you contemplate that? Yes, we understand that all of creation, all of the work, the animal world is see the mouse, everything reflects his glory. And it points us to him. He didn't have to do that. Again, we're raising that question. Why did God places on this earth I want to look at a passage and and accept the 17. And I'm gonna go ahead and read it don't have this on the screen this morning. But Acts chapter 17. And this kind of addresses. Maybe some of the sometimes when people ask the question, Why did God make us while God was lonely, that he needed some fellowship? Well, the truth is, God is an eternally existent, triune, being God, the Father, God, the Son, God, the Holy Spirit, have inhabited eternity live forever. And they are the summation of perfection and completeness. God wasn't lonely. He didn't need anything. In fact, in Acts chapter 17, notice

Mike Roy  18:06
Paul's message on Mars Hill, or the Areopagus in verse 22. So Paul stood in the midst of the Areopagus and said, Men of Athens, I observed that you were very religious in all respects. For while I was passing through and examining the objects of your worship, I also found an altar to this inscription, or with this inscription, to an unknown God. Therefore what you worship in ignorance, this I proclaim to you, the God who made the world and all things in it, we're talking about the creative power of God, the God who made the world and all things in it is Lord of heaven and earth, since and does not dwell in temples made with hands, nor is he served by human hands as though He needed anything. God didn't need us. He certainly wants a relationship with us, ultimately, that would we can spend eternity with Him in Heaven. But from God's vantage point from being eternally existent, he didn't have means like we have, and he's not served by human hands. He gives life and breath, all people all things, first, 26, and from any made from one man, every nation of mankind to live on all the face of the earth, having determined their appointed times in the boundaries of their habitation, verse 27, that they would seek God. So that's kind of what a purpose for God creating us. I don't think it tells us why. The purpose is yes, we need to seek God to search him to obey Him. But it's not really revealing at this point. Why God made us so again, that's the question that we're looking at this morning. And we'll begin to bring the lesson to close shortly is to question why did God make you he didn't have to do that. Oh, and why did the places honestly as well, the one of the verses that is very compelling to think about first John tip the four, there's probably some others. Look at this principle with me and just consider this. Yes, we make application to this lesson this morning. In verse 15, it says, If anyone that acknowledges that Jesus is the Son of God, God lives in them, and they in God. And so we know this is the NIV. So we know and rely on the love God has for us. And then right there in the middle of verse 16, it says, God is love. Now, this one of those, those thoughts that you've got to meditate on and contemplate this, the meaning of this. So this is a verse that describes the essential character of God, God is holy, He is pure, but in terms of his character, the very nature of his existence, God is love. And so we need to understand that everything. Think about this, everything that God did in creating you was driven by a staggering degree of love. Everything he did gifting you with talent and skill, everything about you was fabricated by a God whose essential character is love. That's why God put me on it, sir. Because he loves me. And I don't know why. I don't understand it. You know, if think of if God was looking for fellowship, look at the world in general is turned out to be a mess. Yes, some of us have obeyed the gospel, we love God, we serve Him. But the vast majority of people have turned their backs on God. But the stunning truth, this is one of those Bible truths that you have to meditate on. When you think about this question, why am I here?

Mike Roy  22:04
It's a real question is somehow connected with this foundational truth that God resonates in his life, from the basis of love. So if I complain about my life, or wish things were different, I don't understand how much God loves me. This is one of those truths, you have to understand why you live on this earth before you face God in judgment. And as I think about this, myself, this is a truth that should change us profoundly when we understand that everything that God has done in making us and redeeming us, obviously, is motivated by his love for us. So think about that. Truth. Brethren, friends, as you think about your own life, that God is love, and we're on this earth, because of his love. There may be some other reasons I don't understand. But I do understand one thing, the reason, or at least, perhaps the primary reason you're on this earth, and I am is because God loves you. His whole scheme of redemption was motivated by that. So the next question is, what do you think God wants from you and from me? What he wants is your love. That's the foundation of his character. And what God wants from us is love. But it's honest, love is genuine love, is unfeigned love, it's love that responds to His will. And it reminds me that Eric said, that sense everything that God does, and has done for you and for me, is prompted by a stunning degree of unexplainable love, that I ought to be a person of love. And as a husband, and father, I should love my wife, which I do, and my children. And as a worker, I should appreciate my workers to love them, to treat them right. In the community that we know wherever we are, we are driven by love. And again, as Christians, we shouldn't be motivated by our love for one another. And while we're also in First John, chapter four, look at this last part of that verse. So God is love, and whoever lives in love lives in God. If we don't love, we're not not a part of God's people. Whoever lives in love loves God, and God lives in them. So you think about these passages that we've looked at this morning and First John chapter four, reminding us that the foundation of God's character is this profound sense of love, and he's displayed that to us. We can ask the question to we're blue in the face. Why am I here? Why did God make me this way in the end is was all prompted by his love that He has for us and understanding that he saw us before he made us. And he was aware that we would fail and fall and Cindy saw all our weaknesses, and yet he loves us. And certainly, we need to have that same attitude towards one another. So what God has done for us is motivated by by his love, what we need to give God is profound love, a love that obeys whatever He tells us to do. So the question is, how do you respond to God's love? Again, we raised that question this morning, why on earth you're here. It's because of God's staggering love to you. So this is again a truth that we need to think about and contemplate on as we think about God's grace and his mercy that he has extended to each one of us. But the big question is, since we understand at least from this one brief lesson this morning, that, that everything that God did in his creation was motivated by love. The question for you and for me is how do you respond to that love? Do you say, Well, I understand that God, Scripture says, I need to repent and be baptized, but my grandparents didn't believe so I'm not going to do that.

Mike Roy  26:24
Why would we? Why would we not respond in a loving way to a God who did everything for us on the basis of love? So if we're going to respond to God properly, we're going to be leave in His Son Jesus, whom He sent as the sacrifice for our sins will be willing to repent of our sins and say, Lord, I'm wrong, I'm lost. I'm a sinner on done unclean, then we'll be willing, yes, to be baptized to be immersed in water. To have our sins watchmaker, that would be the loving response to the one who loves you in ways that cannot be defined or explained. If there's someone here this morning, who has not obeyed the gospel of Christ. We urge you to do that before it is too late to believe that Jesus is the Christ, express your faith in him submit the Gods command for baptism, or maybe that you need the prayers in his congregation. We all have our struggles. We all have our difficulties, but understanding love as the foundation of God's character certainly should help encourage us as we serve Him if there's any need that we can help you with this morning. We invite you to come forward while we stand and sing the invitation song
