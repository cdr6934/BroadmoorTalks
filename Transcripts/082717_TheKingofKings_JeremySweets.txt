Good morning. It's good to see everyone here today. This happens to me once or twice a year. And that is, I think I'm gonna have a really good voice yesterday, I thought it's this feeling stronger and feeling better. And then today, it's not so much. So I want to welcome everyone here, especially our visitors, I apologize for my voice, we will do what we can to make it through this. I hate to in any way stand in the way of the Word of God. So maybe you'll just take an extra bit of time to focus on on the words that I'm saying and excuse my voice. Thank you. We've talked the last few weeks about who God is. This year, we're focused on being Kingdom citizens, and we focused on our King. We've talked about the fact that there is one God, we've talked about the fact that there are three persons in one God. And this morning, I'd like to continue with our thoughts talking about the King of kings, King of Kings. As we think about our God, we recognize that he is the King of kings, there are many kings in the earth, but there is only one God. Above all, there are many so called gods that are worshipped in the earth. But there is only one God above all. As we begin to think about the rule of the reign of God, I'd like to turn your attention to First Timothy chapter six. First Timothy chapter six.

This passage comes in the context of exhorting us to flee from sinful things. Because one day God will bring all things into account. And here we see God described as the blessing and only sovereign, the King of kings and Lord of lords, who alone has immortality, who dwells in unapproachable light, who no one has ever seen or can see. To Him be honor, and eternal dominion, amen. One day, God Almighty will bring all things into account. That's really not up to anyone else. God is sovereign. And he will decide and make the choice and the decision about when all things will come to an end and will judgment will come. That fact alone tells us that there's something about this great God, that He is in control. But notice how God has described the blessed and only sovereign. The one who reigns above all. There is no one that rivals God, there is no one that is above God, He is sovereign, describes him as the King of kings. Again, I'll say there are many kings on the earth, but there is only one God who rules above all. We elect presidents. And so he is in charge, so to speak of this country. But God reigns above the universe. And he's, he's not elected. He's not chosen by us as if we could choose him or not choose him to rule He reigns. He rings and he is the King of kings, you know, is interesting as I looked that phrase up King of Kings, it mentions it a couple of times in Revelation, there in part referring to Jesus Christ, but it's also used in the Old Testament of Babylonian and Persian kings of Nebuchadnezzar, and also of Cyrus, the King of kings, and at that time, they would have been world powers. And they would have been a king over many other kings within the world. But here's we come to the New Testament we see that even to a greater degree, God is King of Kings, every king, God reigns. It also says that God is Lord of lords. There have been many so called Gods that have been worshipped throughout time. But there is only one true god that reigns. In Psalm 93, verses one and two, it says The Lord reigns is robed in majesty. Your throne is established from of old your from everlasting. In Psalm 95, in verse three, it says, For the Lord is a great God, and a great king, above all gods. A few verses later it says, Oh Come, let us worship and bow down. Let us kneel before the Lord, our maker or maker, God reigns, God reigns. He created all things, all things were within his wisdom, His power, His intention, he sustains all things. God continues to reign, he reigns above all. Notice, secondly, His character, His character, we see in Exodus 15, if you would open your Bibles there to Exodus 15. And asked a question, Who is like You, oh, Lord.

Jeremy Sweets  06:01
This comes within the song of Moses, after Israel had been delivered from Egyptian captivity. In verse 11, who is like you, among the gods, the Lord, who has like you, majestic in holiness, awesome in praises, working wonders, you stretched out your right hand, the earth swallowed them, and your loving kindness you have led the people whom you have redeemed, and your strength, you have guided them to your holy habitation. Here we see that the question is asked who is like God? And the answer is, there is no one like God. Notice, in particular his character. In this passage, we see three items, at least three items that are mentioned. First of all, his great power, has great power. It says in verse 11, talks about awesome in praises working wonders. God had certainly shown his power in the Exodus. We also see, as it continues on in verse 12, you stretched out your right hand, the earth swallowed them. God's power is, is is awesome, and mighty, He is all powerful. Sometimes we use those Omni words, Omni powerful. What's the word for knowledge? It's not only knowledge, omniscient. And all omni present, which really my understanding refers again to his knowledge and his presence with us, as he is aware of everywhere. But we see that God knows all things. God is all powerful. Again, there's no one that can compete with our God. And that's the first thing I want to notice from that passage of his character. Secondly, I want to notice that he is holy. It says in verse 11, who is like you majestic in holiness, holiness. God is a holy God. And Isaiah six, the refrain in heaven, directed toward God was holy, holy, holy. God, is a holy God. And we see that all throughout Scripture. There is no imperfection in God, there is no sin in God. There is no evil intent in God. He doesn't want us to do evil, he doesn't tempt us to sin. God is holy, and he is perfectly holding. We also say that God is not only holy, but he is loving. In verse 13, in your loving kindness, you have led the people whom you have redeemed, God is a loving God, he extends love and kindness to us. So the question is, Who is like You, O Lord? And the answer is, there is none. There is none. Me put up my characteristics. When you think about earthly rulers. They say that absolute power corrupts absolutely. When people have the power to do whatever they want, they often do whatever it is they want. And they live in selfishness. They rule it away that is self serving. But that's not the way that God rules isn't. God doesn't rule out of selfishness. He doesn't seek sinful desires in any way. God is Different, God is different. And so we see that God is different from all other kings and rulers, but he's also different from other gods, we already looked in this passage, who is likely among the gods, oh Lord, God exhibited in the Exodus, that he was more powerful than any of those that were worshipped. In Egypt. They worshiped the Nile, the Nile turned to blood, God had power over the Nile. They tried to take the blood away, and they couldn't do it. But God could we see the Egyptians had many gods that they worshipped. And God struck at the heart of each and every one of those gods, not everyone, but many of those gods to show and display his mind and his power. And then he could sit back and Israel could sit back and say, who is like God?

Jeremy Sweets  10:54
What other so called gods could do these things, what God can lead his people out what God acts in such a way, no other God acts and in that way, if you know about Greek mythology, and if you know about the concept of other gods that have been worshipped, really they are depictions of super humans. That means that they simply have a power greater than we have, kind of like Superman or some things that we invent. But they also have their kryptonite. Note though, that they act like humans morally. They don't live in a holy way. And these are the gods that men worshipped. But God is not like that. We also say that he is King of kings, and he is not like other kings. You remember in the Exodus, that Pharaoh was not all powerful. In fact, he was afraid that the Israelites would grow in number and rival his power so that they would overcome him. So what did he do in order to protect what little power he had? It says that he oppressed the Israelites. And he treated them ruthlessly by making them slaves. And he was hard on them as taskmasters. And why did he do that he did that building cities and subjugating them so that they wouldn't rival his power. It was all in selfless interests. takes that a step further, it mentions the slavery in the middle of chapter one. And at the end, it says that Pharaoh didn't want their number to increase. So he took another tact. And he asked all the midwives to put to death, the children under two, was Pharaoh a good king. Obviously not. He was self serving. But God is not like that, Izzy, when you think about the Exodus, it's not that they had they were able to give up the concept of any master, but rather they traded masters. They traded Pharaoh and evil, self serving master for God, a master that was loving and caring and seeking their best interest. In the New Testament, we see that another king was worried about losing his power. And he said in the New Testament, Herod said, there's to be a king coming put to death all the children under two, again in seeking his own self preservation there was that a good king? Most certainly not. There may be kings in this earth that are good that that are trying to serve God. But overall, we see that kings serve themselves. But God doesn't act in that way. His character is holy and truly good. Notice also his authority. God reigns above all we've already seen that. And any authority that exists today comes from Him. In Romans 13 says, Let every person be subject to the governing authorities for there is no authority except from God. There is no authority except from God. Jesus stated something in a similar fashion. When Pilate was questioning him, he says, Why are you silent? Don't you know I have authority to release you or to crucify you? And Jesus says, you would have no authority, unless that had been given to you from above.

Jeremy Sweets  14:53
All authority comes from God. We also see that Jesus Christ came in to this world to challenge the worldly powers, to challenge sin that existed in this world, and he brought salvation and as he did that, and God gave Jesus all authority, we see in John 17 and verse two, Father, the hour has come, glorify Your Son, that the Son may glorify You, since you have given him authority over all flesh, to give eternal life to all whom You have given, have given him. Jesus Christ has all authority, he came to give eternal life, to all we see in Matthew 28, Jesus says, All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. Go therefore and make disciples. So God gave Jesus ALL AUTHORITY. When we think about a king and think about God is King, we see that he reigns. He has a powerful, holy and loving character. And we also say that he has all authority and any authority that even exists today comes from Him, He is the source. So what is our response to this? What should our response be? Well, he rains, so let us offer our allegiance to him. We need to pray just like Jesus prayed with at least the thoughts if not the exact words our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name, your kingdom come, Your will be done on earth, as it is in heaven. The heavens recognize God they hallow his name, they recognize his rule, they seek His will. So let us pray that we would do that here and now. Let us seek to Hallo and praise the name of God. Let us seek His reign in our lives. And let us also seek to do His will. We have the choice to make. So let us make the choice to serve Him. Let us make the choice to seek first, the kingdom of God. Matthew six and verse 33. Let us understand that our citizenship you might even could use the word allegiance there. Our allegiance, our citizenship is in heaven. And from it we await a Savior the Lord Jesus Christ. Youngsters where's that verse now? Philippians 320 That's one of our memory verses right? Our citizenship is in heaven. So let us offer allegiance. Schools have children. I don't know if they still do this today. Have the children say the Pledge of Allegiance to the flag and to our country. As Christians, we need to make sure that our primary allegiance is to God. You know, there is something beneficial and even saying that loud every day. Whether, you know in the pledge, they say it aloud every day. As Christians it would do us good to say allowed our allegiance to God. We can use a variety of scriptures that would stay that because it reinstates and it reinforces doesn't reinstates it restates and reinforces let us pledge our allegiance. Let us imitate his character. Some character traits distinguish us from God, for example, his his power, we couldn't imitate his power if we wanted to we are our weak and feeble and limited, whereas he is without limits. And in that case, we simply need to be dependent upon him and his power. But there are other characteristics that we must imitate, particularly his holiness, and his love. Ephesians five one says, Therefore be imitators of God as beloved children.

Jeremy Sweets  19:22
First Peter, 115 and 16, like the holy one who called you be wholly yourselves, also in all your behavior because it is written, You shall be holy, for I am holy. And First John chapter four. It tells us that God is love and that we love because he first loved us we learn love from God by seeing who he is. So let us imitate his character as much as we can. Let us seek to be perfect as he is perfect. Not that we are perfect But we are seeking His character, we are seeking to be more and more like God. When it comes to his authority, let us respect it, let us respect it. And this in my mind, particularly can be seen in two different ways. First of all by listening to what he has to say, by listening to what he has to say, in Acts 17, in verse 11. Now, these Jews were more noble than those in Thessalonica, for they received the word with all eagerness, examining the Scriptures to see if these things were so the brand's searched and looked at God's word. They read it carefully. They read it daily, they read it over and over, they, they didn't dismiss his word, or treat it lightly. They wanted to hear it. And they recognized that it was something important for them to hear. If you are facing health challenges, and you go to the one authority, based upon their medical knowledge, a doctor, you're going to listen intently to what they have to say to you, you want to hear it, especially if there's some kind of life threatening, threatening illness, some sickness, you will listen very carefully to what the doctor has to say. But as Christians, we not only need to listen, but we need to obey. We need to respect his authority by obeying His word and James 122. It says, but prove yourselves to be doers of the word and not merely hearers who delude themselves. Can you imagine in the army, someone goes to boot camp, and they're listening to their drill sergeant. And he says down and give me 20. And they say, Yes, sir. And they just stand there. says, Why aren't you getting down and they would probably use some choice, select words for that. It makes no sense to hear and say that we respect what you're saying, but then failed to obey. We must respect him by listening and obeying. That's the message this morning. I wish I could do more with that it's a little bit shorter. But it may be that you're here this morning and you're not a Christian, you have an opportunity to obey Him. We're going to be singing a song of invitation. This invitation is from God Himself, who wants you to be His child. You can do that by believing that Jesus is the Christ, repenting of your sins and changing course, by confessing that Jesus is the Christ and by being baptized in the water for the remission of your sins. That is the starting place for when you do that you have committed your entire life to Him. And there are no off days. If you're here this morning and you are a Christian, you've committed your entire life. If you're not living as you should make a correction, change your course and do what is right. So then there's any subject to the invitation. Please come as we stand in scene at this time.
