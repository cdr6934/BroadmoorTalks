We had brother Sergei and his family from Moldova here a few weeks ago. And I've always been amazed that people that know multiple languages, you know, thinking about the English language and trying to learn that. So I have a question that I'll throw out there and thinking one way, it's really easy. And then if you say it in another way, it's really hard. So the question is, who are you? So that's pretty easy. But then if I say it like this, who are you? And you can think a little bit deeper and go, Okay, that's not just who am I? That's, who am I? What do I stand for? There's more to it than that. Well, I want to start with a story. And whenever I tell a story from childhood, always think about Trevor grew up not far from me. So he can fact check. Everything that I say, for the most part, but I grew up in a town that literally is known for nothing. Except one thing. It is known, I really, truly am Trevor is not nothing at all is known for except one thing. And that's football. That is the only thing this town is known for. Small town in West Kentucky and, and I have two brothers, we played football growing up and that type of thing. So in elementary school, you have like rec league, city League, and it's like the Rams versus the Raiders. You know, just little team names. And you play against each other and have a little trophy and that kind of thing. Then when you go to middle school in my town, that's when every all the elementary schools come into one school. You know, it's Mayfield Middle School, and then there's the high school. And I remember at the first of the fall, as soon as you get there, everybody who wants to play football comes out and sits in the stands, and you're in the bleachers, and you're sitting there and I'm a seventh grader sitting there. And you know, we're kind of not sure about what's going to go on, there's these eighth grade boys that are shaving and stuff, they're sitting around us and we we don't know what's going on then comes in the coaches, these you know, huge men walking in and, and they don't seem too happy. And, and so they start start talking loudly, and about different things about being a part of this team. And that raiders and rams and all that stuff is long gone. And now you're a part of this city's team. And that that meant something. We were the Cardinals and so sometimes they would say Redbirds, so I remember distinctly you can see that had this had an impact on me. The coaches said, You're a red bird now. And this meant something this man a history of, of success. In the athletic side of things, this meant that we were going to be different that we were going to carry ourselves different that we had a different agenda from other schools. So at that time in my life, when I left that meeting, probably shaking a little bit. I knew who I was, from that standpoint, I was a red bird. At that point, it was something different about me, I was part of a group that was special. Well, thank you for letting me come tonight. I like to thank the elders for the opportunity to speak. It's, it's a great thing to be able to prepare a lesson, a Bible study, you know that from experience, when you prepare something, it really helps you. So thank you for this opportunity. And it's great to see anybody that's visiting here with us. Thank you for coming our way. Well, this question of who am I? And answering that question? is partly a function of what part What are you a part of what group? Are you a part of? What and sometimes the answer may be why don't really know who I am, I'm not really a part of anything. And so I have a cousin of mine who kind of grew up that way. He's he wasn't really a part of anything wasn't really, maybe talented in certain ways that you might think of maybe somebody that's good in school, maybe intelligent, academic wise, or maybe music, or arts, or just popular in general or something. You know, athletics, there's a number of things that maybe you can start identifying yourself with just from a human standpoint, in schools and that type of thing. He really didn't stand out in anything. And so I think he might have said, you know, I'm

Kevin Stinson  04:29
not a part of anything. I don't really know who I am. I'm not part of anything. Well, he ended up being a part of something, he ended up getting good at being with the wrong crowd. And that's one thing that I've seen about all of us is we are going to be a part of something we can act like we're not or nothing's important to us or it's no big deal. I don't really identify myself with anything or anybody. We're going to be a part of something We are a part of something, we just have to figure out where we stand on and what we are a part of. He got to be a part of things that he shouldn't have. And it's impacted him his whole life. It's still impacting him. He's involved with things that he shouldn't have been. And that's what he got good at. And that's what he was a part of. Well, why is this important, this concept of who are we and being a part of a group where there's group dynamics that impact all of us turn over to Daniel chapter three. And I want to read a little bit from Daniel chapter three, and thinking about this group dynamic and how that can impact us for good. And Daniel, three in verse 13, says, Then, Nebuchadnezzar, in a furious rage commanded that Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego be brought. So they brought these men before the king Nebuchadnezzar. Before the King Nebuchadnezzar answered and said to them, is it true Oh, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego, that you do not serve any gods, or worship the golden image that I have set up. Now, if you are ready, when you hear the sound of the horn, pipe, liar, Trigun, harp bagpipe, and every kind of music to fall down and worship the image that I've made, well and good. But if you do not worship, you shall immediately be cast into a burning fiery furnace. And who is the god who will deliver you out of my hands? In verse 16, Shadrach, Meshach. and Abednego answered and said to the king, oh, Nebuchadnezzar, we have no need to answer you in this matter. If this be so our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and He will deliver us out of your hand, Oh, King, but if not, be it known to you, oh king, that we will not serve your gods, or worship the golden image, that you have set up an amazing story that we've read many times. And one dynamic of this is, is this group was not alone, Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego. Could they have stood alone in this situation? Maybe, hopefully. But we can see that they were together. And that had to give them strength. I think they had to have courage, by them being together and being able to, to address this difficulty in their life, this amazing obstacle, and challenge and they did it together. So being part of a group is very important. We can see that in with Peter and John, turn over to Acts. Look in Acts chapter four. See Peter and John here before the council, in Acts chapter four, and starting in verse five. On the next day, the rulers and elders and scribes gathered together in Jerusalem, with Anna's the high priest and Chi office, and John and Alexander, and all who were of the high priestly family. And when they had set them in the midst, they inquired by what power? By what name did you do this, then Peter, filled with the Holy Spirit said to them, rulers of the people, and elders, if we are being examined today concerning a good deed done to a crippled man, by what means this man has been healed. Let it be known to you to all of you, and to all of the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified Him, God raised from the dead, by him, this man is standing before you. This Jesus is the stone that was rejected by you, the builders, which has which has become the cornerstone, and there is salvation and no one else, for there is no other name under heaven given among men, by which we must be saved. In verse 13, it says, Now when they saw the boldness of Peter and John, and perceive that these men were uneducated in common man, they were astonished. And then drop down to verse 21, excuse me, first 23, Peter and John were released. And it says, when they were released, they went to their friends, and reported to the chief priests and the elders, what the elders had said to them, and when they heard it, they lifted their boys together to God and said, Sovereign Lord, who made the heaven and the earth and the sea and everything in them, who through the mouth of our father, David, your servant, said, by the Holy Spirit, and then if you can drop down to 29, it says, And now Lord, look upon their threads and grant to your servants, to continue to speak the word with all boldness. I

Kevin Stinson  09:30
think this is another great example of Peter and John being together there in front of the council, the Holy Spirit with them, they were able to be courageous. They had a group that they knew was right there with them. As soon as they were released. They went to this group, they had a group that they were identifying with, that they were a part of, that would help answer the question of who are you? They had they had other people that were like minded, that gave them courage. Well, overing in Galatians, two Turn over to Galatians for a minute. You know, sometimes there can be a negative impact of a group. And in Galatians, two we see Paul talking here and he talks about Peter, who was so courageous in so many parts of his life and then says in Galatians, two in verse 11, but when seIf is came to Antioch, I opposed him to his face, because he stood condemned. For before certain men came from James he was eating with Gentiles. But when they came, he drew back and separated himself, fearing the circumcision party. And the rest of the Jews acted hypocritically, along with him. So they even Barnabas was led astray by their hypocrisy. So you can see that at times, this group has forces on us and a dynamic that also could have a negative impact on what we do. A part of whatever group we are in is an important thing. It's important to how we live our lives in John 18 and verse 15. We see there, Peter again. And in this, here's where he denies Christ. And we won't, won't read through that. But in this section, you know, Peter was in the garden, and he was courageous. And he was ready to fight. And he was doing this and we know, you know, the courage of Peter. And then when he was here at a different point, he was he struggled with his courage to he didn't know what to do. He he denied Christ, he was not able to if he had had maybe a group there with him, would that have helped him in that situation? So being a part of a group is a big part of who we are. Well, what kind of groups do we have here at Broadmoor, this is pretty active group as far as different things that we have going on electronically. I know there's a men's group type thing that has a communication mechanism where we can send out positive messages. There's women's Bible studies, teen Bible studies, there's geographic Bible studies that we started up earlier this year, where those that live in a certain area can get together. And that's been a nice thing for us to do. There's many different avenues that we have. And maybe there's some that need to start. Maybe there's some that aren't there that we need to think about. But these different groups have been a real positive for me. And I think, for most of you, as well to help keep our minds centered on God and keep our minds centered on Christ. So I think that's a wonderful thing that we can be a part of, but you know, by the nature of who we are, and living on this earth and being a part of the world, living in the world, but not being of the world, we are parts of groups that aren't spiritually minded. We are parts of groups, from a school standpoint, from a work standpoint, maybe a social standpoint, many different standpoints, that we are a part of groups that we have to be careful with. And we have to think about how much time are we spending with that group? You know, sometimes we think about the question of Is This group is being with this group good or bad? And we think, Well, it's a question of, are we impacting the group? Or is the group impacting us? Well, the answer is both right? We're probably having an impact on the group. And the group's probably having an impact on us. So whenever we spend time with a group, I don't think we should ever view it as some sort of a one way thing that we're only impacting that group, there's going to be a two way road on that there's impact going both ways. And we need to be very careful about who we are spending time with. So the answer to the question of who am I is partly answered by who do we spend time with? Well, another kind of more individual concept of who am I? is also maybe the question of who are you? Or how are you doing? And then maybe you say, Well,

Kevin Stinson  13:52
I don't really know. I guess I'm doing okay, I'm not really sure. Well, from a work standpoint, you know, I can, I can go to work and my groups were responsible for certain things at work, and you and all of a sudden, I get a meeting, notice, and I come in is John from audit. And so John from audit comes in, and he's like, Hey, he's, he's dressed nice. And he's smart guy, and friendly. And we're talking, he's going to talk to you a little bit about your, your group. Tell me more. Tell me about what you guys do. I want to ask some questions. So Mike, Oh, great. Well, he's a nice guy. And so we're talking about, you know, the good, the bad, the ugly, we're talking about everything going on with the group. And here's what we do. Here's what we don't do. And it's, you know, really nice prayers. He spends a week with us. And then a couple of weeks down the road, here comes an audit report. And the audit report. All it lists is all the negatives that we talked about. I'm like, John, we had this great thing going we were talking about all this, you know, we're doing so many amazing things and all you have on this list are things that we need to improve that are problems with our area. And you know, now I'm not so sure about John I'm from audit. But what he's done is something important. He has found some problems, some opportunities that we can improve to help us. When you think about that, from a spiritual standpoint, is there somebody in your life that can help you with a spiritual audit that you can talk to about things that are going? Well, that's great. There's a number of things going well, spiritually, for all of us. But what are some things that aren't going well? And can we talk about those? Can we share those? And can we have the feedback to say I need to work on that, these are some things that I need to fix, you know, the, the work standpoint analogy of that, in my line of business, in the computer type field, we're trying to make sure that we have things done such that if there's some sort of disaster, or some sort of major problem, that we could restore the system and make sure it works. Well, we don't want to wait for the disaster to find out that something doesn't work. You know, it's kind of like that real tight hairpin curve, that doesn't get fixed until something bad happens. That's not something that we need to think about in our life, but especially spiritually, if we wait on things and don't take care and take action, there will be a time where there is no more time, right, there will be a point where there's not another opportunity to fix anything. So when we think about a spiritual audit, or findings, you know, we have peaks and valleys in our lives. And we need to be honest about where we're at, we need to think about what's going on right now. What are some things I can do to improve, were some things that I need help with, I have an opportunity, hopefully, at this point, we don't know the future, it may not be long. But maybe we have some time, that we can address some things. So by all means, we need to figure this out and start from this list and view it as a positive thing in our life that we can work on. Well, there's other benefits to knowing who we are, you know, that story that kind of started with was this living as we had like a standard, this high level of standard on this team, that when we went somewhere, we had confidence in who we were other teams knew who we were, there was there was a certain sense of we don't partake in certain things that are beneath the quality of a team like this. Well, what about us as spiritual people, as Kingdom citizens, are we holding ourselves in a high enough standard, we are a part of an elite and elite spiritual force think Mike mentioned that a few weeks back and elite spiritual force, do we view ourselves like that, if we're part of an elite force, there are certain things that we're not even going to be tempted by, we're not going to work, we're not going to think about, we're going to just push those off to the side. Because an elite spiritual person is not going to endeavor in that it's not going to worry about some of these trivial things and get involved in things that they know they shouldn't think about an Olympic train or somebody training for the Olympics, they're going to have a regimen around eating and sleeping around their training, you know, there I can see this Olympic athlete, and it's their own birthday party and, and somebody brings the cake out, and they don't eat the cake at their own birthday party, because it's not something they do. They're in a mindset, they're gonna push that away. They don't they don't partake in that. It's not a part of who they are. At that time. I think that's a mindset that we need to think about and could help us as Kingdom citizens, as spiritual people, there are certain things that we should push away, we're not going to try to tackle that battle of temptation. Every time this thing is put in front of us, we're just going to push it aside and make a determination in our lives, that we don't deal with this anymore, that we're not going to be tempted by it's not something we're going to get involved with an alcoholic. One of the first things that they say right is you have to be able to recognize and admit that you're an alcoholic. And then from then on, you don't not become somebody tempted by alcohol. But you said you'd become somebody that knows that's a temptation. And I believe that the training would be there from that point on, you don't partake, that it's not there in your life, that wherever alcohol is, you're not a part of it, or you will completely turn away from it. And that reminds me of a saying that it's probably been said in many languages in many ways. But for one, the saying I've heard is for some total abstinence is easier than perfect moderation. And for some of you younger kids, that total abstinence means just not doing it at all right? For some of you for some of us, and who really is that Psalm? Is it not all of us to a point for us, isn't it at times that completely not doing something is easier? then trying to moderate something that might be okay. It might not be that bad, I can moderate that. Is it? Is that really the prudent way? Is that what an elite spiritual force would do? Or would they say, You know what,

Kevin Stinson  20:13
I'm pushing that aside, I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna worry about I'm not gonna deal with I'm not gonna moderate it. I'm going to completely end my involvement with that. Does knowing who you are help you with your dress? Does it immediately think my number one goal in life is to dress modestly? Secondary, I can think about styles, I can think about other things. But I'm going to dress modestly. That's all that matters. From an elite spiritual kingdom says I'm going to dress modestly. I'm going to do that. I'm going to use language that's appropriate. I'm not going to worry about was this word, okay? Is that word, okay? I'm just going to use language that I know is okay. I'm going to put that stuff aside. How to Treat others. Galatians five, verse 22, verses fear we've been studying. This is who we are love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self control. These are things that we need to strive for, this is who we are. This is what we need to be like. Living a wise life, wisdom in our lives. What is wisdom? You know, is wisdom has been defined, in some ways as wisdom helps you navigate the difficulties in life. So that's what wisdom is to help us to navigate the difficulties in life? is one way to think about it. How do we navigate the difficulties of a Christian life? Are we being wise about them? Are we putting certain things away? Are there movies, other different things, that we just put rules in place, and we just don't see it? We don't we don't think about and have to wonder every time it comes into our, into our presence and have to start making decisions? So the answer to the question of who am I definitely has an individual type response, who am I? And the answer will be answered one way or the other, we can come at and say I don't really know, I'm not really sure who I am. But at the end of the day, the question will be answered. The answer is there. We can see how we live our lives, we can see what we're doing with the time that we've been given. And we can see who we are. We've been talking about Kingdom citizens a lot this year. And you know, this term, a model citizen came up, I was kind of thinking about that. And then I started thinking about, you know, something we might want to be careful with in some ways. Have you ever been to that neighborhood, it's a new neighborhood, they're having a building, Project, a lot of new homes everywhere around Nashville, right? And there's a model home, and you go to the model home and you go in, you walk around, and you see it. And it's beautiful, right? There's all these things, but something is like not right about it. It's like this, no one lives there. Right? There's not actually anyone living in this home is beautiful on the outside, it has all the amenities. It's functional, but no one's using it for anything, there's something wrong with this model home. And I think that that is something that many of us here have been Christians a long, long time. And in some ways, we know what it's what we think of that we're aspiring to be from a Christian standpoint, we can think of a model citizen. And I think it's a, it's a thing that we need to understand is, are we striving to be a model citizen, but in some way, we're hollow on the inside. And something is just not not right. There's just no one living there. There's this shell of a Christian, that's doing the things that are good, but they're not really there. They're just we're doing them because this is what we've been trained to do. And there's not really a passion or the soul and we're just No one's home. I think that's something that we have to be careful with. And Revelation, chapter three. We talked about the Church at Laodicea. And it reminds me of this concept of, of maybe a model home where we're no one's there and it says in Revelation chapter three and verse 14, And to the angel, the church and Laodicea right, the words of the amen to faithfulness and the True Witness, the Beginning of God's creation, I know your works, you are neither cold nor hot. Would you that you were either cold or hot. So because you're lukewarm and neither hot, nor cold, I will spit you out of my mouth. It's something I want us to think about tonight. In this concept of who we are. Do we put on a view to others, that we are Kingdom citizens that we are striving to be a model citizen in this kingdom.

Kevin Stinson  25:03
But is there actually no one living there? are we struggling with the passion in our lives of striving to serve God? And knowing why we are doing it? What how can we take this maybe to the next level? How can we challenge ourselves? How can we be the best? You know, we can think about not being the worst, you know, is one way to think about well, I'm not as bad as that person. You know, the whole concept of I just have to be faster than the slowest person when the bear is chasing me, right? I just want to be better than others. Well, that's not a concept that we find anywhere. We need to be the best that we can be. We are here for a reason, we're here to serve God. That's why we're here. It's not about trying to be better, and trying to look better than someone else. It's an individual thing. Who are we? How are we serving God? And are we challenging ourselves? Do we have some level of competition that says, I want to do better? I want to be the best Christian and best Kingdom citizen that I can be? Are we spending time with the right groups? Can we spend more time with the right groups and less time with the wrong groups? Can we find others that we can confide in and develop a spiritual inventory of things to work on? That we have that person that we can talk to? Can we take that feedback? Can we work on it? Can we renew our minds? With frequent study and prayer, we have these ups and downs, we know that that happens. We have to come back and renewed, we have to start again. We have a quarter here starting from our Bible study classes here at church. How can we make these next classes we're in the best Bible class that we've ever been in? Is that something we can think about? How can we challenge ourselves? How can we make this the best Bible class that I've ever participated in? This morning, we had some visitors. And it was one visitor that a number of you know, and I know this person, I haven't seen this person in years. And I'm guessing that he may have asked this question to some others here. And it caught me off guard. And it may be something that you do in your lives. But you know, there's the concept of how are you doing? Right? How are things going? Well, this person said, how was your walk with the Lord going? And at first I was I couldn't, like, didn't really know what he said. And then comprehended what he said. And I said, it's going well. And I was kind of it just caught me off guard. And I was like that is? That's a good question. How is your walk with the Lord going? Are we doing that with each other? Are we so superficial at times? And I know I am that. We're just kind of glossing over what's going on? And we're just going through the motions. But how is your walk with the Lord going? How is my walk with the Lord going? We need to be honest, we need to understand that it's not always going well. And that there's times that we need each other. There's times where we need to make changes. Well, tonight, I wanted to talk about this question of who am I?

Kevin Stinson  28:28
And I just want us to remember that that question will be answered, if you're struggling with answering the question of who am I understand that that is a difficult question at times. And that's something that we may wrestle with, but we can't run from it. We can't run from it and try I think that's what so many people in the world do. They run from these types of questions, and get busy with things in the world. And they fight for the nothingness. As if you remember Sergei mentioned that as people that will fight so hard for nothing. And that's what happens in the world. And that's what could happen to us is we can fight for nothing we can get busy for nothing is not important. We can get active and passionate about things that just don't matter. So we don't need to run from the question of who are we? We need to think about who we are. We need to wrestle with it. We need to spend time with it. We can answer this question. And the answer will help us further the kingdom of God. The answer that we're looking for, is in some level of confidence that we are Kingdom citizens. That's who we are. That's that's what we need to be doing is being about the kingdom. Thank you for your time this evening. If there's anyone here that has been thinking about putting on the name of Christ, this is a great opportunity. We've talked about that. We don't know how much time we have on this earth. We don't know what's going to be given to us. If this is a time that you're Ready, that you understand where you're at and you understand what you need to do, this will be a wonderful opportunity to come forward and to be baptized to name the name of Jesus. It's also an opportunity we have that if there's some things you want to talk to the group about, and confess some things that you want to get out in the open. Maybe there's the prayers the congregation that you would like. There's a number of reasons that you might want to come forward and if so, please do so always dancing
