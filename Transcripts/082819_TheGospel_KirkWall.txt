The greatest story ever told, begins in Genesis chapter one. And verse one. In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. It's the greatest story that certainly any of us will ever hear. And it's the greatest story that has ever been told. The story of complete perfection, it's really hard to imagine that a perfect place called Paradise, everything about it is perfect. There's nothing wrong or out of place, there's nothing negative, there's nothing bad. Man and woman are there at all purity and innocence. Everything is good. They don't know anything that is bad. But what makes paradise so special is that God is there. Can you imagine walking and talking with God, they were doing it here on earth. And God says all of this is for you. Everything is for you. Just one exception, just this tree of knowledge and good and evil. You're not to eat of it, but everything else is for you. Well, you know the story. The serpent, deceived, even she took of it and she ate, she gave it to her husband when he ate, their eyes were opened. And they realized, shame coming upon them they had sin. And you know what the worst thing was for them. God leaving and going back to heaven, he could not stay and be in the presence of sin. And thus comes religion. For that is the very definition of religion. It's a Latin word, we have the word religion, it comes from a word called RE ligera, or something like that. But the prefix remains by back. And Ligier means to bind back to bind, binding sinful man back to God, they had sinned in the garden. And now God's not there. They've got to find a way how to get back to God. And so here we are all these many years later, and look down the street, how many religions we have? How many churches there are, and we as mankind don't get it. We are trying ourselves to get back to God and we cannot do it.

Kirk Wall  03:02
But God had a plan. And the only way to get back to God is through his plan, not ours. And if you come up with your own religion, it's not God's. And I dare say you will not get back into a right relationship with Him, because it's only through his plan. And that plan is called the gospel. And it's very simple plan to understand. But this is the plan that brings you back into a right relationship with God. It's called the plan of salvation, because that's what it does. And so I love going to First Corinthians chapter 15, where the apostle Paul makes it very clear here to the Corinthian brethren about this gospel. And so in verse one, he goes on to tell them, he says, Now I make known to you, brethren, the gospel which I preached to you, which also you received, in which also you stand, by which also you are saved, if you hold fast, the word which I preached to you, unless you believed in vain. Now, I think this is interesting. He says, I make known to you this brother in this gospel, which I preached to you when was that? It was back in Acts chapter 18, where we see he's going there to Corinth, and I think this is when the first time he went there, and he he started working with these people, and they start this church there at Corinth. And he says, You know, I preach to you at that time, the Gospel, you believed it, and you stood for and you stand because you know, that gospel is what saves you. And then he goes on in verse three, and he says, For I delivered to you, as of first importance what I also received That Christ died for our sins, according to the Scriptures, and that He was buried, and that he was raised on the third day, according to the Scriptures, and that he appeared to see this, then to the 12th. He says, I delivered this to you. It wasn't something that came from me because I received it, and I passed it on to you. But how important was this, Paul? He says, the very first thing I did, when I came to you, I preached to you the gospel. And here we are now all these years later, and I'm having to write to you in a letter because you're getting off track here, the Corinthians poor people, they had so many issues and problems, and he says, You got to get back to your foundation, you got to get back to the Gospel, because that's what gets you in the right relationship with Jesus, you got to be reminded of this in what is that Gospel, Paul, he says, It is three things. He says Christ died, he was buried, and that he was raised again, on the third day, that is the gospel. And he says, This is what saves you this gospel. This is what brings you into that right relationship with God. Now what I want to share with you, and I appreciate your attention, a few verses here about this gospel. And I want you to see and understand what happens when people hear this story of his death in his burial, and resurrection. Just briefly going to Acts chapter two, they're in Jerusalem, on the day of Pentecost, Peter, and the rest of the apostles there, they're preaching this gospel, and they asked, what is it that we need to do to be saved? And Peter says to them, Repent and be each of you, and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ, for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. Now dropped down to verse 41. And he says, So then those who had received his word, were baptized. And that day, there were added about 3000 souls, brothers and sisters when they heard the gospel. When did they obey it that day?

Kirk Wall  07:27
In Acts chapter eight, here, we're looking at Simon he's a sorcerer. And there's here in the city of Sumeria, and the Samaritans in there, it says, After he's preaching, it says, But when they believed Phillip, preaching the good news about the Kingdom of God, in the name of Jesus Christ, that's the gospel. They were being baptized men and women alike. Even Simon himself believed. And after being baptized, he continued on with Philip, when was it? When was it that they were baptized? It says when they heard the preaching of Philip, right, then you move on to x chapter eight, down a little bit further. In here we have Philippines having a really busy time right now. He's, he's called to go to this guy, this this unit. And so he sees the unit cup in his chariot. And he's reading from the Old Testament, Isaiah chapter 53. And he walks up to him, he says, you understand what you're reading? He says, Well, how can I unless I have someone guide me. So he gets up into the chariot, and what is he start preaching to Him? Jesus Christ. Oh, wait a minute. I thought it was Isaiah chapter 53. That's right, because that's what it's about. It's about Jesus. And notice what happens after hearing about Jesus and they went along the road, they came to water, and the unit said, Look, water, wha prevents me from being baptized. And Philip said, If you believe with all your heart, you may end he answered and said, I believe that Jesus is the Son of God, brothers and sisters. When did this happen? After he heard Phillip preaching and notice what happened, then in verse 38, and he ordered the chariot to stop, and they both went down into the water and Philip as well as the unic and he baptized him. The UNIQ immediately responded to the Gospel after hearing it and understanding it. Next chapter nine. Here we have the account of Paul, who at this time is called Saul, and here he is on the road and Jesus comes and He's blinded by this light. Jesus talks to him. And it says in verse 18, of chapter nine, and immediately there fell from his eyes, something like scales and he regained his sight and he got up and was baptized. And so we move on to chapter 22, where now some years have passed and Paul is recounting what took place. And Ananias, was the guy who baptized him. And he says, This is what Ananias told me. He says, Now why do you delay? Get up and be baptized and wash away your sins, calling on his name? When did he do it? Right then when Ananias told him to do it, you move to x chapter 10. And verse 48. Peter, the very first thing when the Gentiles and I love this passage after they had the Holy Spirit come on them, he commanded them to be baptized. In the name of Jesus Christ. You moved, Acts chapter 16. And verse 14, Paul's go into this city called Theia. Tyra and they go to the river there, he hears this prayer meeting going on down there, and there's a bunch of women there. And verse 14 says in a woman named Lydia from the city of Theia, Tyra a seller of purple fabrics, a worshipper of God was listening. And the Lord opened her heart to respond to the things spoken by Paul. And when she and her household had been baptized, she are just saying, if you have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house, and stay. When was it that Lydia and her family obeyed the gospel? It was right after they had heard what the Apostle Paul said. And it was the sharing of the gospel of Jesus Christ. Acts chapter 15, you move on, Paul stays very busy. He hangs around there in the same city, he and Silas. And there's this girl, she's demon possessed. But this demon was very good at prophecy. And so people made money off of her, but that demon knew who these two guys were. And that demon said, of these two men, he said, These men are from God, and they speak the way of salvation. Well, the girl slash demon kept following them day after day, and Paul got a little irritated. So he, he removed the demon from the girl and the people got mad. And so they, they take Paul and Silas and they begin to beat them. And then they're thrown into prison, and they're put in chains and their feet are locked in stocks.

Kirk Wall  12:29
But an earthquake occurs, their chains fall off to prison doors open, it wakes the prisoner guard up, and he comes in and he sees that the doors are open. So he assumes they're gone. He draws a sword to kill himself. And they say, No, stop, don't hurt yourself. We're here. And he says, What do I need to do to be saved? Let me stop you. Just real quick here. Did you ever wonder about that? You are wrongfully beaten for preaching the gospel of Jesus Christ. You're beaten, you're thrown into prison, you have these chains. And then in the middle of the night, your chains just fall off. The doors open up, obviously, and miracle from God. He's literally opening doors. And they stayed. They didn't run away. It's like, if you ever needed a sign from God, here it is. And they stay. Why did they stay? Look what happened. He said to the jailer, Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved you and your household. And they spoke the word of the Lord tomb together with all who are in his house. And he took them that very hour of the night and wash their wounds, and immediately he was baptized, he and his household. When were they baptized that very same hour of the night. immediately, immediately it took place. And then you move to Acts chapter 18. Here we have the story of Christmas and the Corinthians that are gathered there. He's a leader of the synagogue, and it says he believed in the Lord with all his household, and many of the Corinthians when they heard believing or believing and being baptized, when was it that they were being baptized, that says, when they heard you move on to Acts chapter 18. Or rather excuse me when they heard this, they were being baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. They did it when they heard it. Brothers and sisters, one cannot look at this gospel message and all these stories and not walk away with the fact that hearing the gospel of Jesus Christ was urgent. Everybody who heard the gospel of Jesus Christ that we have in these passages, they responded immediately.

Kirk Wall  15:12
Now, let me ask you a question that don't need to raise your hands at this pulpit some away. How many of you who've never heard what I just preached? I imagined just about every single person in here is heard everything before what I just said, You've read these passages before, and rightfully so. And that's a good thing. But I want you in it to realize brothers and sisters, the urgency of the gospel. I was asked to come and speak as the rest of the men upon you know, if Paul were to come, what's the message he would want? What is the message he would want to tell us if he could come here. And my mind kept going back to Corinthians, because the very first thing he went there, and he spoke to them was the gospel. And then when he had the opportunity, then later on to write them, what was it that he wrote to them about a lot of their problems. We know that first and second Grampians, but they're in the middle of it in chapter 15. He says, Brothers and sisters, you got to get back to the gospel. It is the foundation of your very living. If you live by the gospel of Jesus Christ, you're going to be rid of all these other problems you've got, you're going to get back into the right relationship with God, because that's what the gospel does. And tonight, I want to plead with anyone who is here, who is not a Christian, to become one right now. Tonight. If you need to raise your hand, I'll come where you are. But you need to obey the gospel tonight. And my plea is, is that you don't put it off. And an audience this large, there's got to be somebody here, who believes in Jesus, who believes in God, they've heard the plan of salvation. They believe hell is real. You also believe heaven is real. And we have that relationship where we can go and live with Him forever and eternity, along with all our other saints and family. That you've put off the gospel. And so I want to plead with you tonight not to do that anymore. But to make right now, your stand for the Gospel. The Gospel invitation is given. The song is sung. So we all stand that you stand in saying the gospel invitation song, but you don't obey it. I know what that's like. It's hard. I remember so well, the guilt that I had, trying to sing the invitation song looking like I'm all good, and a smile on my face when it was eating me up inside. Because I know I needed Jesus. I needed that right relationship. Let me tell you something. When I graduated eighth grade, I walked along with a really great burden on my shoulder, I felt so guilty. Because all those kids that I spent all those eight years with, I never talked to them about Jesus, I felt so guilty. And then I went to high school. And because of that guilt, my inner circle of friends became smaller and smaller. Because I didn't talk to them about Jesus and I thought, how can I do that? I'll be a hypocrite. How can I talk to my friends about Jesus when I myself, have not obeyed the gospel? I know what that guilt is like. But I also know what the joy of obeying the gospel brings. When I was baptized, that guilt was lifted off my shoulders, the joy was overwhelming. And then I'll tell you what I got to share a great experience. And many of you know this is that when you then sit down and study with somebody else, and they obey the gospel, you share that joy all over again. And it grows. And my love for Jesus has grown year after year after year and it's greater and greater. And that's because of the power of the gospel. You need to The Gospel tonight,

Kirk Wall  20:01
you need to do it right now. You don't need to wait. And let me tell you something else. You may have a reason why you've not obeyed the gospel? We all do. And we know we should. But we don't ask yourself very clearly in your mind, what is it that's keeping me from being baptized? What is it that stopping me from do that? From doing that? And I want to tell you something that whatever your answer is, it is not as strong as they need for you to obey the gospel. You don't know about tomorrow. None of us do. The thought of being able to put your head on the pillow tonight. If you'll be able to sleep, because you will be so happy. The joy will overfill you. Because your sins will be lifted away, you will now be in a good relationship with God. And this is where your life begins. And your education really starts tonight. It grows years ago, the young people we did a lot had lots of devotions as teenagers and Bible studies and singing for the old folks. And we just had a great time and there was a lot of us. But we were at McDonald's one night. And I remember vividly sitting there, the four of us in a booth and Dewey comes over and he walks up to me and he gets down on one knee and his arm on the table. He looks me in the eye and he says Kirk, what should I do? I knew exactly what he was asking. Do he was a great kid High School, lived at home with his mom and dad. He had been to all the Bible studies in the singings. And just wonderful. Everybody loved him. He loved everybody. And he knew he wanted to become a Christian. He knew that's what he needed to do. But he had a problem. His parents told him that if he became a Christian, they would kick him out of the house. Because they were not believers. So when he asked me that question, I simply looked at him and smiled. And I remember these words, I said, you know the right thing to do? continued eating my Big Mac. But that's what I told him. So he did baptize Dewey, just a short time after that. And his parents, they kicked him out of the house, they get their promise. The last I heard Dewey. He's a faithful member of the Lord's body, he and his wife and along with their kids. And I'd love to go and ask him. Do you remember all those years ago, when your parents kicked you out of the house? Are you sorry, you made that decision? Do you have regrets of becoming a Christian? I can just see the smile on his face. Are you kidding me? I know he would tell anybody. Don't let something like that stop you. Because when you put Jesus on and baptize them, you put Jesus on. You clothe yourself in him, he is there to protect you. He is there to bless you. He is there to guide you not to mention these 200 people right here. You will be taken care of. That's God's promise. Matthew chapter six and verse 33, you will be taken care of there is nothing that should stop you from obeying the gospel of Jesus Christ right now. You need to do this. Don't put it off any longer. What can I say I so much wish I was like Peter and Ananias and say, he point to you and call you out by name and command you to be baptize. They could do that. I can't. What can I say to encourage you to become a Christian? Jesus said He that believeth in his baptized shall be saved. And you'll be in a right relationship with your heavenly Father, both here on this earth and in the life to come where you'll pay the G the gospel of Jesus Christ. Please do that at this time come forward. Now. While together we stand in st
