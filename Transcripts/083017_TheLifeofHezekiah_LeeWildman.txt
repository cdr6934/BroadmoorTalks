I certainly appreciate being asked to come back for you fellas. Extending that invitation, we enjoy coming and spending some time with you, it's not often enough. We enjoy this time and the meetings and other studies you have. And us being able to spend some time together, we get to see some of you our place now and then VBS. Several of you come, you obviously are growing children on this side of town. I don't know what's in the water over here, but it's going good and looks like to me, I've heard about that. And that's a that's a blessing isn't. So it's good to see all of these couples here and these children and it is a blessing to see you raising them up to love the Lord. per se, the prayers. I know some of you have known and she'll be upset with me, but that's too bad. But we're thankful Betsy is doing better. Getting stronger, we still have all the answers yet to what's been going on with her lungs. But we're getting the really bad stuff eliminated. It seems like we still have some more tests to run. Gave us a scare a few weeks ago when she was coughing up some blood. And anyway, we've gotten through that. Still trying to figure it out. So thank you for your prayers on her behalf. Appreciate that. Folks from Hillview send their greetings. I don't know, most of you know that we appointed elders back in April. Both of those fellas, you know, well, I think so blanket certainly. And Marlon Salman. And that's first time he'll view and over 50 years ever had elders. It's been a blessing. And we're glad to have him. We'll push involved and get that done. We're very thankful. I love those two fellas and appreciate them. I think everybody was worried about a father in law and a son in law. If you know them, they couldn't be any different. And they balance each other out and working together. Well, so far, they're still trying to figure it out to along with the rest of us. All right. Well, I think I'm supposed to talk about Hezekiah tonight. So let's do that together. So what in the world can we learn about Hezekiah from a king that lived 202,700 years ago, and here we are in Nashville in 2017. And trying to learn some lessons from an old king, you serve the Lord, in the days of the kingdom of Judah. All scripture is profitable for reproof and instruction for righteousness. Paul told Timothy and and obviously includes Old Testament scripture, some may conclude that mostly it was Old Testament scripture, when Paul made that statement, I'm completely sure of that there may have been a number of the New Testament books already circulating in scripture. But nevertheless, we can read the Old Testament, and learn from these stories. But we need to study the Old Testament and remember that we have been given something so much better. And the Hebrew writer reminds us of that, that we have a better covenant, the better hope, better promises better sacrifice in Jesus, a better resurrection. And I think that plays into a little bit of the things we'll read about. And we talked about his reaction to finding out and Hezekiah is when he knew he was sick and going to die. And some of the comments that Isaiah records that he made when he thought he was going to die, I think we have a bigger picture, a clearer picture, really, if you will, of life to come and even as a kya head. And so how blessed we are to have the blessings in Christ that we get to enjoy that he never got to enjoy in this life. One things I want to mention, I've got two or three main points tonight, but how much do you learn about parenting? From the Old Testament kings? If you want to say not much you we would be in agreement. I'm not sure how you get through some of these stories and learn some of those lessons. How would you have a Hezekiah and if you never you know anything about Hezekiah at this point, you know, we're talking about one of the best kings that Jude ever had. And he raised a Hezekiah. And he raised somebody who at 25 years old, decides he's going to lead one of the greatest greatest restoration movements and of all time, young man with great conviction. How do you do that? Well, I guess you start off by worshipping who and anybody you want in any way you wanted. You even burned one of his little brothers and sacrificed to your God.

Lee Wildman  04:55
You worship a multiplicity of idols even in Druce introducing some of them into the Old worse of down to temple. In fact, at some point, you get tired of that and you shut the doors of the temple, you won't even let the priests in there anymore. You encourage moral decline among the people. And when times get tough, you turn to the most worldly people you knew, and even adopted their religion because it sure looked like their religion was working a whole lot better than yours. And that's how you raise a Hezekiah. I guess there are children who grow up with parents like Ahaz, the father of Hezekiah, do realize that's not what I want to be. That's not the way to do this. So somewhere along the line, he made up his mind, he wouldn't be like his father. For many of us, that's not been a problem. Thanks be to God, by the grace of God we raised by Christians and others not so fortunate. Maybe some of you had to decide, you were going to serve the Lord. Even though your parents either weren't. Christians were Godly in any way. We're only folks. And you just came to realize that there is a God and that Jesus is the Son of God, and you decided I'm going to serve him. I don't know about his mother Abijah. The daughter of Zachariah did more chronology today than I wanted to do. And I tried to figure out if that was the same Zachariah was the son of Jehoiada, the priest that was killed by Joash the king, because he prophesied against Joe hash. At best that may have made her about 56 or so if she had Hezekiah. I guess that's possible. Back in those days, maybe there was a mother behind the scenes that was encouraging and helping her young boy Hezekiah, to love the Lord even though his father did not. Anyway, I think the first thing we think about Hezekiah is this restoration effort, his father had made a royal mess out of things. And so when Hezekiah became king, he tried to clean things up, literally open the doors of the temple and cleaned all of the idolatry out of there. It had become a place of disrepair fall into great disrepair. He led the priest in becoming sanctified again and got it got them in all of their order. So they could serve in and around the tabernacle the temple as they had in the past. sacrifices were offered. Some of them even at Hezekiah, his own expense. And then he led the people and what the Scriptures say was the greatest Passover they had enjoyed since the days of Solomon. In fact, it was an unusual Passover because they were so busy getting the temple cleaned out, as they were doing that during the first month that ended up going through that week of the Passover. And so it came around to the second month and they didn't know what to do. They wanted to keep the Passover and Hezekiah prayed and the LORD LORD said, we'll make an exception on this occasion. So on the 14th day of the second month, they enjoy the Passover. And they enjoyed it so much. They did it another week. And there was great joy in the city. As Hezekiah, the king was leading the people back to a proper worship of God. And then they started bringing the ties. And they were in heaps, and they had to build rooms, to put all of the ties that they were bringing. So it's an exciting time. Most remarkable times in the Old Testament, there are in fact, three chapters given and Second Chronicles just to talk to us to teach us about all that Hezekiah and led the people as he led this great restoration effort over Second Chronicles 31 with me. Second Chronicles 31, verses 20 and 21. This Hezekiah did throughout all Judah, and he did what was good and right and true before the Lord is God, and in every word that he began in the service of the house of God in the law and in the commandment to seek His God did it with all his heart, so he prospered.

Lee Wildman  09:32
Would you like to be described that way? I would too. I would like God to be able to say that about me. And I want him to be able to say that about you too. And listen to me. He can. It is possible for us to love the Lord like Hezekiah did. It's possible as for us to be as devoted to God as he was and to enjoy the fellows. ship with God that he enjoyed. What I want to tell you tonight, I know none of us are in the position of Hezekiah get some power is king. And he could do some things that maybe not everybody else could do as he was in that position of rule may ask you something tonight about restoration in your own life. There are times in which even we as God's people need moments and times of restoration. Can we not at least look at our own lives and think about restoration that needs to take place and areas of our lives, which we may have fought let fall into disrepair. I believe we can teach others to do the very same thing. Fathers can lead your families in restoration. Sometimes we need to admit as Christians we can look around we've allowed some idols to get into our lives. And worship is something we just kind of squeeze in and we're still doing the things that we're supposed to do together. But you know, it's kind of hard to come in here and get our minds off the everything else that we've been going have got going on. And come in here and try to really for just an hour or so focus on the worst of the God deserves to challenge isn't it. I'm a sports minded person. I hope less than I used to be.

Lee Wildman  11:39
But I couldn't even get out of the parking lot or out of the driveway in the suites tonight, and they were kind enough to invite us over for supper, it's a great time to be with them. Because I pulled in with my Indiana plate on the front and I saw the UK sticker on the back of their van til Jeremy so this is one area we're not going to get along very well.

Lee Wildman  12:04
We can take it pretty serious. And sometime we take away two series. A while back I was talking to young man, fine young man. He was telling me

Lee Wildman  12:19
say your old is playing baseball and it's a Wednesday night and it's a pretty big game.

Lee Wildman  12:27
And he decided that they would go to the baseball game. He asked his eight year old after that what he thought about it and eight year old said to his father, I wish we'd gone to Bible study. He said I've never been kicked in the shins so hard. I told him I said you've done a great job raising him up to that point and don't give that up. Our hearts are surrounded by idols. Sports was pretty important to me when I was growing up can be pretty important to us. But it's not important, more important than worshiping our God. Entertainment, and just stuff just playing Steph Curry justness is idolatry. That's our problem. My problem. Living in a culture like we live in. The challenge is not to make sure that I do not have a heart full of idols so that I can offer to God what He alone deserves. both privately and together and assemblies like this. I may be challenging you right now. But please understand, I'm not challenging you any more than I'm challenging myself. And maybe sometimes there's some things we just haven't been doing when you start doing them. Maybe like reading the scriptures and serving like we'd like to be serving and worshiping and teaching others reaching out to others with the gospel, finding ways to do the work the Lord has given us to do clean out all the stuff clean out all the idols so that we've got time to do what he wants us to do. Hezekiah would have done that. Let me tell you something else, please. How we worship matters. What we do together matters. How we do these things matters. I understand there expedience involved and are doing the things that we believe have been commanded to do together. But that matters what we do together, who leads and who does not lead matters. What we must do to be saved matters. God didn't tell Israel how to worship him and then we come to the New Testament have him say to us, why don't you All just figure it out on your own. I'm sorry people didn't get any smarter after Jesus came, they weren't before. We were still sinners in desperate need of the guidance of God. I worship may not be like the Old Testament worship, I understand that but I still believe it's a New Testament provides a pattern for us and our worship together. I had one preacher Tell me a few years ago, he said, you know, we're just a family. And like families, we decide when and how often we'll eat. And so we get to do that with the Lord's Supper. And all I see in that is massive chaos I think the Lord has instructed us we met work out a little bit and we have to study it a little bit. Lovely leave the Lord has taught me to meet with my brethren every first day of the week, and break bread with them and eat the supper with them. Take no joy in telling you this, but the Western Hills church that just meets right up the road from us at Hillview on Sunday morning, introduced instrumental music into their worship for the first time I know that because one of them came and met with us Sunday night disturbed by that activity a keyboard and two guitars and the drum if you're gonna do it, do it with a banjo and mandolin. You know, I mean, give me some bluegrass you know, gospel but anyway, I'm sorry to be too light for the moment but seriously instrumental music authorized by the Lord. You know, what we're going to have to do is we find ourselves in the midst of churches that are drifting from pattern worship in Scripture, where folks are departing from well established principles. Not Church of Christ originated, not our restoration, restoration fathers, as we may call them originated, simply principles found in the Word of God, that help us establish what it is he wants from us.

Lee Wildman  17:23
We may need to be Hezekiah. I don't know how popular Hezekiah was with everybody, I will tell you that when he sent out people to invite them to the Passover, you read in one text at some of them playing made fun of it. But there were others who said humble themselves said we need to be there, we're going to be there and come there and worsen. We need to be careful. We mean, Nate, we may need to be those that stand up. And sometimes we may need to be those who stand up when we're not doing the things we ought to be doing. And say something and start doing the very things that we've been neglecting. That's possible i i Welcome Bible study that challenges us to make sure we're doing what we ought to be doing and raising questions. Why don't we do this like they did in the New Testament. If we're not doing Hezekiah would have stood up and said, Wait a minute. This is a departure from the biblical pattern. Let's go back and do what God says. And let's do it with the enthusiasm and joy that God deserves. And here are some things we ought to be doing. We haven't been doing this, let's go back and start doing these things. We can be like Hezekiah. And we may need to be on occasions when we don't even yet realize will be put in those positions. Well, there's another point. And that is he was obviously a man who I say obviously you studied him, a man of prayer and faith. And Second Chronicles again verse in chapter 30. In verses 18 and 19. This is when the people and and evidently they bear hurriedly gotten things ready to worship, but they hadn't gone through the all of the purification processes that the law required. There's a multitude of people here many from Ephraim Manasa is a current Zebulon had not cleansed themselves yet they ate the Passover contrary to what was written. But Hezekiah prayed for them saying, May the good Lord provide atonement for everyone who prepares his heart to seek God the Lord God of his father's, though he is not cleansed according to the purification of the sanctuary. And the Lord listened to Hezekiah and healed the people. There is a picture of the mercy and the grace of God in that passage of time and some interesting facts Esther used to think about when they had done some things that were contrary to the law. He prays for them. God hears the prayer, He heals them, He forgives them. But may I say to you that the next time they did it, they probably didn't do it that way. They made sure they had time to get themselves ready, and keep doing that over and over. But the main thing I want you to see at this point is, here's a man praying for His people. It makes a difference. When we realize what was about to happen to God's people. The Assyrians surrounded Jerusalem, and taunted the people and mocked their God, which by the way, is not a good idea because God happens to hear that.

Lee Wildman  20:48
In Second Chronicles 32, I want you to look at verse number one. This is after this restoration. Chapter 30 to one of Second Chronicles after these deeds of faithfulness.

Lee Wildman  21:06
Hezekiah looks out and at least 185,000 Syrian troops have surrounded the city I would not have faulted Hezekiah for asking the question, Lord. We have done everything we can to do what you have asked of us. And then I look out over the walls, and we're surrounded by our enemies. Now you may have thought to himself, these are the fellas that my father went after to ask for help.

Lee Wildman  21:43
And so Hezekiah prepared for battle. But he knew the Lord would fight for them. And then he took the letter. This mocking letter that the Rab Sikka spoke in the presence of all of the people there on the wall. He took the letter, he laid it before the Lord and the temple. And he and Isaiah prayed. I want you to know that this wasn't the first time God had heard from Hezekiah in a while. This wasn't Oh, well. I'm in trouble. I need to pray to God. This is a man whose habit was prayer. Now he was ready to pour his heart out to God saying, Do you see what's going on here? We need your help. We need it desperately. You remember how that ended? One Angel killed 185,000 Syrian soldiers that night. Jesus said he could call for 12 legions of angels. I think that pretty well take care of the human race.

Lee Wildman  22:55
Great show of power. People have asked Why are those stories in the annals of the Assyrian kings, I got a pretty good idea why? Let's forget that story. What's not tell our people that that snuck or went back home. And he was killed by two of his sons and a house of worship. And he found out that his God could not save him from his own children.

Lee Wildman  23:27
Have you noticed that in life when things seem to be going so very well. You wake up one day and you've been surrounded by the enemy and you got a piece of paper in your hand

Lee Wildman  23:51
and the piece of paper is an x ray report are the results of some blood work? Maybe it's a pink slip. You have no idea and you got there on Friday in the Boston clean your desk

Lee Wildman  24:14
it's a divorce paper it's a police report. All kinds of difficult things very challenging things can happen to God's people. God hasn't left us in a position where bad things cannot happen to us. Can the devil still do to us what he did to job? I'm not sure I have a clear answer to that. But it seems to me there's a lot of things going on in the world. And I wonder if God says I'm gonna allow that to happen because my people need to be tested. And all I know that makes a tremendous battle. Those are very hard things sometimes. And you take it out and you lay it on the floor. And you get down your hands and knees and your face to the floor and you plead to God for help, because you realize you can't do this on your own. We need moments like that. When we know that it's just, just God. We believe that God is with us. He will be with us, you'll help us you'll save us. And we need some Isaias in our lives, we need Isaiah that we can that will pray with

Lee Wildman  25:34
us. Maybe even personally, at that very moment. Or halfway around the world. We know that the praying for us, we need them.

Lee Wildman  25:48
We need godly people. We need local churches. We need people that love the Lord deeply and wholeheartedly that we can go to and say I am struggling here. My city is surrounded. I'm not sure how we're going to get out of this. I believe that God will help me.

Lee Wildman  26:05
I don't have a clue how he's going to do it. Please, pray with me. Well, after that happens Hezekiah gets sick. And Isaiah comes to tell him what God had to say to him. He said you need to set your house in order you're about to die. He was 39 years old.

Lee Wildman  26:36
He was 14 years into his 29 year reign. And now he finds out he's gonna die. He turns his face to the wall. He doesn't Pat like Ahab. He prays to his God, pleading with him that I've done all of these good things. And I don't think there's necessarily boastful about it. He said, I've done all this faithful things, and now I'm gonna die. And God gave him a sign I wrestled with that and I come to the conclusion he did ask for a sign. And I and God gave it to him time move backwards. Wasn't quite like it was we could go Monday, but it was still amazing thing. Time didn't stop last Monday. But when that fascinating. That's the time time goes backwards on this. It's interesting to me that Hezekiah asked for a sign. I think God allowed some of his people to do that. whose faith may not even been able to be as strong as others later on even our own. But on that occasion, he gave it to him. Not enough he prayed for more time prayed for more time he didn't want to die. God said okay, I'm gonna give you 50 more years.

Lee Wildman  27:57
Look at Isaiah 38. Isaiah 38. I guess I can understand the 39 year old father, a mother

Lee Wildman  28:13
to three, four young uns running around. She finds out she has cancer. And she's pleading with God no, please let me live to raise these children. And understand that there's another side of me that says Why didn't I? Why didn't Hezekiah say You know what? It's better to go and be with the Lord. Maybe that's because his faith wasn't where Paul could have his faith years later when he wrote Philippians. But when he writes this, it sounds like some of the things written in Ecclesiastes in verse number 10 of Isaiah 38. I said in the prime of my life I shall go to the gates of Shijo I am deprived for the remainder of my years. I said I shall not see Jehovah the Lord in the land of the living I shall observe man no more among the inhabitants of the world. My lifespan is gone and taken from me like a shepherd's tent. I have cut off my life like a weaver. He cuts me off from the loom. From day until night you make an end of me I have considered until morning like a lion. So he breaks all my bones from day until night you make an end of me like a crane or a swallow so I chatard mourn like a dove my eyes fall or fail from looking upward Oh Lord, I am oppressed undertake for me. What should I say? He has both spoken to me and he himself has done it. I shall walk carefully all my years and the bitterness of my soul. I guess we would oh Lord by these things man live and all these things is the life of my spirit so you will restore me and make me live indeed it was for my own peace, that I had great bitterness, but you have lovingly delivered my soul from the pit of corruption for you have cast All my sins behind your back, for SEO cannot thank you death cannot praise you, those who go down to the pit cannot hope for your truth, the living the living man, he so praise you, I do this this day, the father, so make known your truth to the children. The Lord was ready to save me. Therefore we will sing my song was stringed instruments, all the days of our life and the house of the Lord. It seems to me that Hezekiah was saying, if I find I can't stay here in praise you i can't seem to you I can't continue to lead the people as the as their king. And maybe there's some sense in which we would feel that if we knew, especially the 39, that our days were numbered. I do think as Christians with this better hope and better resurrection. Knowing how much more blessed we are. Don't think we would say I wish I could live so I can go to another church service and worship with my brethren. Let me see, I can do that. Or I can go on and worship

Lee Wildman  31:12
God and eternity. Things to think about? Are we afraid of dying? Was he afraid of dying? Did he know what lot lay on the other side? But lie on the other side? I don't know.

Lee Wildman  31:33
And I must say something here before we look at just another pointer to the end of this lesson. It is obvious that God came to Hezekiah as help and answered his request with Yes. deliver them from Sinatra and his army gives him 50 more years to live. Will all of your requests and all the mind be answered that way? Every now on Facebook, somebody say we'll post something that says like or share if you believe God answers prayers. I usually leave a comment and I say I do believe God answers all of our prayers. Because I've come to realize that no is an answer to I think there's some people that think that God answers to ways yes right now and yes, sooner or later. And I'm here to tell you tonight there were two outstanding men in the Bible. One of them I hesitate just call a man who prayed earnestly three times and God said No, his own son. And some years later, Paul prayed for his thorn in the flesh to be removed and he prayed three times and God said no. Moses in the Old Testament already been told you're not going into the promised land. He came back and asked God one more time. Can I please go and you know what God told him Hush. So now if you're not going in? answer's no. And yet, I believe with our faith in Jesus and our hope of eternity and everlasting life, we can even accept the nose. Because not everybody is going to get a yes answer. On everybody a 39 is told they have cancer is going to live 15 more years. Because God doesn't care No. Be a misuse of these stories to expect God to say yes, all the time. He had a great purpose in answering those. But here's the point that I want you to finish with me tonight is what did he do with the next 15 years? I find that interesting. Did he sit around for 14 and a half and do what he wanted to do and said, Okay, I'm gonna get ready right at the end. I don't think he did that. What had happened to Hezekiah is because of this famous incident people were bringing presents to him from all over, after the Assyrians had been defeated, in fact, is probably the nations that had been defeated by the Assyrians going, thank you. They came in, they brought these presents, and he became very rich and honorable. And then it was an envoy from Babel, and they were coming to bring the president to, and they wanted to learn about the scripture say the wonder that had happened. I mean, if this has been social media, this would have been the viral event of the decade of the middle of the millennium. 185,000 men died, what what was that in one night just had that happened? So that word gets out and the kings are coming to nations are coming What was that about? What was it? But they brought their treasures. And when the envoy from Babylon came Hezekiah took him down to the temple and showed him all the riches in the temple in the beauty of the temple. And then he took him to his own house and his own store rooms, and he showed them all of the riches in fact, he told Isaiah I showed them everything I Have I think part of the mistake he begins to make is in verse 15. And second Kings 20 When he said I sold them my treasures. Whoa, wait a minute Hezekiah Have you forgot something? Do you know why you have the treasures? Excuse me? Did you have anything to do with 185,009? Not one thing other than your prayers. It was God did the Word. The Bible says his heart was lifted up with pride. Remarkable statement made in Second Chronicles 3231 That God withdrew himself from me and tested him to know what was in his heart. You ask God for 15 more years, be careful, God may be getting ready to test you. He's getting ready to ask, what are you going to do with it? What are you going to do with the time PLIF that I'm going to give you Hezekiah humbled Himself, by the way. Acknowledged is wrong. The judgment that God brought upon Judah came later, not in his day. Before I end with that question, what would you do with 15 more years one more parenting point. So an ungodly Father raises a very godly son. And then Hezekiah has Manasa. Who is synonymous with being the most evil king of Judah. In fact, it was the point where God said, We're done.

Lee Wildman  36:49
We're finished here. This is not working. I'll save a remnant. I'll keep the promises I made to Abraham and David. But we're done with this kingdom business because I can't find a king that wants to serve Me. And we can't get a succession and Manasseh comes along and he is worse than his grandfather. No, I don't think we can know a whole lot about that. But it is interesting that Manasa was 12 when he became king, which means that he did not grow up when his dad was the great restore. He grew up with a father whose heart was lifted up in pride.

Lee Wildman  37:35
It was both full of all of his stuff. That's who he grew up with. So lesson there for us. What would you do? With 15 more years? You know, we don't know how much time we have left?

Lee Wildman  37:59
Would we spend that time showing off all our stuff. When we check off some of the items from our bucket list, we knew I got 15 more years I got this bucket list and I got a lot more things I want to do

Lee Wildman  38:16
when we retire from serving the Lord, would we use our time and our resources in the Lord's work? When we use our opportunities, or talents to develop our abilities.

Lee Wildman  38:38
We study, study to teach. When we become leaders and among God's people, would we serve more than we've ever served before?

Lee Wildman  38:46
I don't think we have to ask what we would do with the next 15 years.

Lee Wildman  38:57
It's good question. But I think the best question is I can ask what am I doing now? What am I doing now? What am I doing with the God the time God has given me?

Lee Wildman  39:14
Am I growing? Am I pushing forward? Am I reaching forward to making sure that he is more and more the only God in my life as I continue to clear out all the junk from the temple of wits I'm supposed to be and he dwells in me. And he becomes more and more. I become more and more who he wants me to be. He lessons from Hezekiah I think there's some thank you for staying with me tonight. I appreciate it. We're going to extend an invitation try to move people there'll be the gospel trying to get people to some people who are early Know what they ought to do and and try to get them to to make that step. How

Lee Wildman  40:08
much time do you have? Jackie? Sure. I mean, as has God communicated to you that you have 15 more years and you're gonna wait till the last month of the 14 year? You don't know. But it would be such a blessing for you and everybody associated with you if you would go ahead and do what you know to do and do it now. And then live the rest of your life for the Lord, preparing to beat him in eternity. Can we help all the rest of us I hope we're encouraged. Don't be discouraged. You can be a Hezekiah you can have his faith. You can make mistakes. God will be with us. lift us up. Use us for His good. We can do that. If we can help you tonight when you come as we stand and sing together
