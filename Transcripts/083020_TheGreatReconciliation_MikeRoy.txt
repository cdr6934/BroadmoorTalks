live in is always a great opportunity to get together. We were planning to worship in our backyard today but the rain chain step at this was we're thankful for the opportunity to get together today. And even this afternoon as we've sung the songs and prayed together and read God's word and, and commanded the Lord suffer with appreciate JDS thoughts, it just reminds us that we belong to each other we belong to God. And we'll make it through the struggles of this life is we stay connected with our God and with each other. I want to just share a few lessons with you this afternoon from Ephesians chapter two. So I'll just be speaking from my from my Bible with my notes here. But Ephesians chapter two, the passage that Jesse read for us is the text for my lesson. And from then some observations to make with for each for each one of us. The Book of Ephesians is designed to help us see the lofty goals and purposes of God's church. It's it describes the magnitude, and the scope of God's planning from all eternity, by which one day he would bring all people, all nations into one fellowship, as we were singing this afternoon. And so it's a powerful, brief book that, again, reminds us of this, this eternal scheme of redemption, his plan of salvation, that brings all people into union with Christ through obedience to the gospel. And one of the things that stressed in the book of Ephesians is the perfect unity and the fellowship and a sense of belonging that we all have in the body of Christ, whether we're older, young, black, or white, or male or female. And so thesis is is a powerful message for us. But I just want to focus on these verses 11 through 22. This afternoon, and if I was going to title this, it would be the great reconciliation that has occurred, especially between the Jews and Gentiles. And again, this section from Ephesians, chapter two, in verses Liberty 22 stresses the oneness in Christ, the unity that we all have in Jesus Christ, in spite of remarkable differences that may exist in our personalities, and backgrounds, and all that type of thing. So this section really is stressing the oneness, that we have the unity in Christ. And it closes with the remarkable message that we the church, God's people are his actual dwelling place is not a temple. It's not a building like we didn't see in the Old Testament. So in the previous section in verses one through 10, which we're probably fairly familiar with those a lot of focus on God, but in verses 11 through 22.

Mike Roy  03:05
The shift focuses on the transformation that takes place through obedience to the gospel, and it reveals the changes that take place. So the three things that I want to talk about, briefly this this afternoon. In the first one from, we'll be looking at is again, the unity and the oneness of God's people. So I'm just going to read a couple verses make some applications to that since Jesse read the text force, but what Paul is telling these Christians over here in verse 11, he's really addressing the Gentile Christians. He said, Therefore remember that that formerly you the Gentiles in the flesh, who were called Uncircumcision, by the so called circumcision. So this is a term of derision that the Jews are making towards the Gentile Christians. If they're calling them you're uncircumcised, where we are Jews, we were circumcised according to the law of Moses, but unfortunately, they were only circumcised in the outer flesh, not in their hearts. So they were still carnal in their thinking. And he said, that you the Gentiles in the flesh, who are called Uncircumcision, by the so called circumcision, which is performed in the flesh by human hands. Remember that you were at that time separate from Christ, excluded from the commonwealth of Israel, in strangers to the covenants of promise, having no hope, and without God in the world. Wow. Talk about a bleak and hopeless situation. This was the Gentiles condition before obeying the gospel of Christ and being added to his church. And so God is reminding these people through the apostle Paul, especially the Gentile Christians to remember how bad and how bleak and how hopeless their life was before they came to know Jesus Christ and obey the gospel of Jesus Christ. And he called on them to also remember the ocean In hostility in the serious disagreements that each group had with one another, if you listen to Conrad's message this morning, you can see the attitude of the Jewish crowd towards this Gentile woman who had faith in Christ. And, and even then, sometimes calling these Gentiles dogs. So in the attitude that existed between the Jew and the Gentile, they despised each other. They hated one another. This was passionate,

Mike Roy  05:34
evil attitudes that existed between both of them. So the Jews on the one hand, again, they're they're calling the Gentiles, you're uncircumcised. And you've not been physically circumcised like we are, even though in their own hearts and minds, they were they were not changed, apparently, again, from that text that Conrad used this morning, even calling them dogs. Because they viewed him that way. That's an odd thing to think about this, how openly hostile the Jews, these are Jewish Christians, too, as Christians, they're the attitude that they had towards these Gentile Christians. And the Gentiles. I'm told, on the other hand, considered anyone who lives outside their cities to be heathen, one of the commentary, Tyndale, his commentary, so this is this is open, serious hostility between the two groups in general. And and hopefully these Christians are changing in their in their mindset. But what a stunning reversal, especially for the Gentile Christians from being non citizens, citizens exclusion, separation, hopelessness, to intimate union with Jesus Christ. They were outsiders, they were they were cast aways. They were rejected in that sense. And so first of all, these Gentile Christians needed to remember where they had been and where they were today. And I think it's a reminder to us, I need to remember where I was in my hopeless condition before I obeyed the gospel of Christ 42 years ago, all of us need to think back on the days before we obey the gospel. And again, as you look at this text, think about some practical applications, when we see the level of hostility between the Jewish Christians or the Gentile Christians, and hopefully a lot of that went away in time. But it wasn't something that that was instant, because for ages, the Jews and the Gentiles had such hostility against each other. But now, Paul's telling them that these Gentile Christians are one in Christ journalists. These days, he's leveled the playing field, and appointed makers of Jews and Gentiles, who hated each other with such passion could now worship God and serve one another. So can we if they had such strong disagreements with with each other, surely, we can work together in love, whether we're from the north, or the south, or the east, or the far west, or some foreign culture, that in Christ, we can love and serve one another, in spite of our educational, cultural, geographical differences. So again, if the Jews in the first century could, and the Gentiles could lovingly work with each other and worship together, then certainly we can do the same. And we can even love our enemies if we're called upon to do so. But in order for the Jewish Christians and a Gentile Christians to worship together, to love each other, to serve each other, they had to change their mindset, they had to change their attitude, I came across a statement have adopted this or change that just a little bit, says that. Without change, there can be no growth. What that means is, if I'm not willing to change, if I'm not willing to change them, I will be unable to grow. And so it's again, it's a compelling message for us to think about, as you think about again, consider the vast differences, significant differences, the animosity, and you'll continue to look at the text, the hostility that existed between the junior Gentile is broken down through Jesus Christ and His sacrifice. And so again, just want to make some make some practical applications we just talked about in worship, but what about family situations? You know, perhaps, there may be some ongoing resentment or bitterness that a Christian might have towards his or her mother, or father, or maybe your father in law or someone else just irritates you and rubs you the wrong way. You have a hard time, you know, being with them. Well, the point is, as we're saying, this morning, we are one, we are one in Jesus Christ. It doesn't matter where we came from, or how difficult someone's personality might be. We are one in Christ and we worship God together so that this section starts off For some practical applications, as we see that the significant differences between the Jews and the Gentiles could be overcome through the faith in Jesus Christ, and we can certainly do the same. Continuing in this first section, and verse,

Mike Roy  10:15
verse 13, he said, But now in Christ Jesus, You who were formerly far away, had been brought near by the blood of Christ. So again, what an understatement the Gentiles, who were so far from the truth, so far from God's from his kingdom, in the Old Testament, history or the context, so far from the covenants of promise, they were outsiders, they were alienated, they were lost, they were undone, they were in ignorance. He said that, you know, the, the in Christ Jesus now had been brought near by the blood of Christ, the Jew can have access to God through Jesus Christ and the Gentile can is well, and they can worship together in the same body, the same fellowship of Christians. And so again, it's a, it's a remarkable change in their condition in their status that comes about through the power. As JD mentioned, the blood, the most powerful sacrifice ever made, took place at the cross where Jesus was crucified. His blood forgives every single person of their sin if they're willing to repent and obey the gospel. This is hard for us too, because we sometimes get squeamish around blood again, as JB mentioned, but the blood of Christ was so powerful, that actually broke down the wall of separation between the Jew and the Gentile, but it brought forgiveness and it brought the Gentiles who were way out left field, so to speak spiritually and religiously, and brought them into perfect union with God through the blood of Christ. So now the Jew and the Gentile can worship together and hug and embrace each other, and give one another the holy kiss, as long as they're not dealing with the Coronavirus or something like that, or know that they probably had issues in the first century. So again, what a remarkable statement, you have Iligan, verses 14 and 15. Before we continue in this next section, is this for himself is our peace. That's an emphatic expression and the Greek language he himself is our peace, who made both groups into one and broke down the barrier of the dividing wall. You may have heard that in Jerusalem, that the outer courtyard wall had a saying on there, I think some of the ladies may have talked about this recently, that basically said, you know, it's at your own risk. If you go past this outer wall, and you may lose your life, it's going to be your own fault for doing that. I'm not sure if that's what Paul is referring to here, probably not. But he is talking about the Jesus in His blood breaking down the barrier of the dividing wall. What was the dividing wall, I think it was wasn't just this physical wall. It was the old law which by its nature caused the separation that the Jews were to be distinct and separate from the world. So there was a, a separation there. And so it says that he himself is our peace, who made both groups into one and broke down the barrier, the dividing wall by abolishing in his flesh the enmity, which is the law of commandments contained in ordinances, so that in himself, he might make the two into one new man, thus establishing peace. So again, as you think about this, verses 14 and 15, tell us how Jesus brought about peace, for mankind with whether it was a Jew or the Gentile. But he broke down that dividing wall that separated the the Jew from the Gentile. The language here is if He abolished in his flesh, the law of commandments, expressed in ordinances. That is the Mosaic law, it was the purpose was to develop Gods on people for them to be distinct and separate, but they were not to intermarry, they would be very different. And there was some kind of they were, they were isolated in some ways, there's an exclusion there. And so when Jesus death on the cross, and his blood being shed, broke down that barrier, so that Jew and Gentile had the same access to God can worship God in the same setting, intimate setting. And so the goal here was that he might make one new man as powerful. Again, red and yellow, black and white, whether we're some of the north or south or east, west and doesn't matter, that in Christ and through his powerful sacrifice, God made us one new person or type of person. Reminds me of the passage of Paul said in Second Corinthians 517 If anyone's in Christ Jesus, he is a new creature. The old things have passed away and new things have come in So I want you just to think, with me then about this, this first section here, verses 11, through 15. Focus on the unity and the oneness in the body of Christ. And we want to continue to maintain that. Secondly,

Mike Roy  15:15
verses 16 through 18. The emphasis here is on the peace of God that comes about as a result of Jesus sacrifice, on on that cross. So this is all strung together in this text, least numerical standard version. And it says any might reconcile them both in one body to God, through the cross, by it, having put to death, the enmity, and he came and preached peace to you who were far away, and peace to those who were near. For through Him through Jesus Christ, we both have our access in one spirit to the Father. So again, in the broad language here, that's why I titled this message, the great reconciliation. God is reconciling two groups of people who were antagonistic, they hated each other, couldn't even stand to be close to a Jew and a Gentile couldn't stand to be close to one another. And so what Jesus did it and he accomplished through his sacrifices, he brought peace between these groups in his great reconciliation. So Jesus reconciles both the Jew and the Gentile through him in his body through the cross, verse 17, actually, let me stopped it for one second. So verse 15, He abolished in his flesh, the empathy, which is the law of commandments contained in oranges, so that in himself he might make the two into one new man, thus establishing peace, and might reconcile them both in one body to God through the cross, by it, having put to death, the enmity so we're not used to the even the New American Standard Version uses this word, what did what did Jesus do at the cross? What is his perfect sacrifice do he put to death, the enmity, the hatred, the Ill Will that existed between the Jew and Gentile was crushed at the cross. That's what he's saying over here, he broke down that barrier. And he even broke down the hatred, that that was existent between these two groups, and brought them peace in in the cross. So verse 17, just kind of repeats in an earlier truth. And then a verse 18, he says, For through him, we have, we both have our access in one spirit to the Father. And so again, the Jews and the Gentiles have the same relationship with God, and the same access to the Father through the through the sacrifice of Jesus Christ, that that he brought about. So again, verses 16, through 18, emphasize the peace that we have with God, both between the Jew and the Gentile, and especially between us and our relationship with God. The third section I want us to look at briefly this afternoon, is verses 19, through 22. So this is really the implications of Jesus sacrifice and the love of God, and the scheme of redemption that his was, was being fulfilled in Paul's time, and it continues to be fulfilled in our time. And so really, in this section focuses on the idea that we are members of God, God's own family, again, Jew, and Gentile doesn't matter where we're from. And so that's this is part if you think about the book of Ephesians, God's eternal plan of salvation, before the world was even founded. He had he had a plan by which you would make all people who are willing, anyone who was willing to come and obey the gospel would be part of His family. So it's a remarkable thing to think about. So in verse 19, he said, so this is kind of like the conclusion. He says, So then you are no longer strangers in Aliens. He's talking especially to the Gentile Christians. You're no longer outsiders. You're no longer strangers, and you're not aliens, but your fellow citizens have they have true citizenship, full citizens citizenship in this kingdom, God with the saints, and are of God's household. The Jews in the Old Testament were God's chosen people. Ultimately, the was a purpose was to bring the message of salvation to all people. But now the Gentiles are actually part of God's family, his household. And he says over here, having been built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus Himself being the cornerstone. So what is he saying over here?

Mike Roy  20:01
that this is not some haphazard decision or some afterthought. But God had a plan to bring the Gentiles into His family into His kingdom, through Jesus Christ through the blood of Jesus Christ. And this was built upon the foundation of the apostles. And the prophets, it could be referring to the Old Testament prophets, or some new testament prophets, and Jesus Christ is the cornerstone. So what this conveys to us is, it's an image of security and belonging, the greatest desire in need, I think, that we have as human beings is that that sense of belonging to belong to a certain class of people, or type of, you know, work, if you're an engineer, you might have certain groups that you have membership, and and the doctors and dentists do all the same thing, but that the greatest need that we have is for belonging to God. And so the Gentiles who are such outsiders now, they're they're part of God's own household, they have the same access to God and heaven through faith in Jesus Christ. And they're built upon being part of the family of God, the house of God, the temple of God, so to speak, they built upon this foundation of the apostles preached that the prophets teach, preach that, and Jesus Christ did that Chief Cornerstone anchoring that whole building together. So it was a song we sometimes sing how Firm a Foundation. And that's what this that's one of the messages that's that emanates from this text over here. So again, this is this message of belonging, and security and trust, and no longer that outsider feeling that these Gentile Christians would have had. But they, they're part of God's family, and they're built upon a solid foundation, they have real hope. Now, look at the last couple of verses over here in verse 21, it says, In whom the whole building, being fitted together is growing into a holy temple in the Lord. So what he's saying there that Jew, Jewish Christians, and Gentile Christians are together, growing into a holy temple of God. And it's reminder to me as we think about the Lord's church, we're thankful to be a part of that. It reminds us of the essential nature of the Church of Jesus Christ. This is part of God's plan from all eternity, that he would put Jew and Gentile in his fellowship of Christians in his body of believers in his church. So when he's talking, when he's talking about the temple, or the building, where the body he's talking about his group of people, he,

Mike Roy  22:48
there was sometimes called the church, and the language is being the whole building is being fitted together. We all have different talents and skills. I'm not the song leader thankful to have guys like Jesse and chants and Marshall and JD, God took the lead saint, we all have different roles to play within the body of Christ. So we're being fitted in and being fitted together growing into a holy temple. In the Lord. I think about this one of the point with me as we look at this context over here, so in verse 22, kind of in conclusion, it says, in whom you also are being built together, so that the Gentile Christians are being built together with the Jews into a dwelling of God, in the spirit or by the Spirit. Think about the implications of that. In the Old Testament, where did God dwell? He dwelt in the temple, he had he had the outer courtyard, they had the Holy of Holies, the inner place there and God, God's presence was manifested in the temple, the physical temple, and yet that all went away in, in today, ultimately, in God's plan of salvation. God designed for his presence to be manifested in us. So we, the people of God, the church of God, not the building, but we are the dwelling place of God. So whether we worship God, as we planned this morning, in our backyard, or this afternoon, or in our building, or sometimes years and years past, we call it the meeting house. It's this reminder that God dwells in us, his people may be in a sense, you may talk about him individually, but I think collectively, he's saying that God's resting places dwelling places abiding place, His dwelling place is in you and me in the church of the living God. And so this what I call it is the great thing glorious reconciliation. So God reconciles the Jew and the Gentile in one body, his church, and he is glorified. In you, and in me, in US loving one another, and helping one another in serving together in spite of our differences, all the different whether again, whether it's educational, or, or financial, or whatever it might be, that we, we glorify, we glorify him in this process. So this section of Ephesians chapter two, again, I'm calling the great reconciliation with a great and glorious reconciliation. So ultimately, it's a reminder for us, I think, for each of us, that God dwells in his people, no longer in buildings, but in his people. And in and I think it's reminder for us that we need to be the kind of people who please God, let's, let's get you know, we want to overcome differences, bickering, or whatever it takes place some times in the body of Christ, we need to maintain complete unity and think of the Jew and a Gentile could achieve that in Christ. And surely we can do the same in America. Sometimes we think that Christianity is an American religion. It's not. It's a worldwide religion, consisting of all those who have have obeyed the gospel of Christ. So I wanted to share that with us, each of you this afternoon. Ephesians chapter two, verse 11, through 22, powerful message of the the oneness within the body of Christ, the peace that we have with God and with each other, and to remind ourselves that we are God's dwelling place. And we need to continue to manifest that type of love towards one another that God wants us to, we're gonna sing a song this time. And we is we live in our life, live or live, we sometimes have a proper attitude, sometimes towards parents or brothers or sisters in Christ. And sometimes we need to make changes. And that's one of the messages here about these Jewish Christians and Gentile Christians. They had to change in their attitude towards each other, so that they could worship and serve God together and thankful that we have love in unity here at Broadmoor. And we don't want to we want to continue to keep that we'll sing this song at this time.
