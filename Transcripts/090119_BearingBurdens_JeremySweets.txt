Good morning. I have a full crowd here today, it's always good to see you to be able to study God's Word with you and to be able to worship with you. We've had a great worship so far, being able to sing praises encouraging one another. Appreciate Nick and his selection of songs and his work there. It's been good to be able to focus on the Lord suffer, I appreciate Justin's remarks, I think they were they were helpful and beneficial. So it's just, it's good to be with you today. In our Bible reading, we've been looking at Galatians. In fact, we finished up the book of Galatians. This morning, looking at Galatians chapter six, I'd like to just summarize or look through some of what we saw there in the book of Galatians. In Galatians, there is clearly a problem that is occurring. In fact, Paul has a harsh tone as it begins to letter he seems to be upset with Galatians. And part of the reason for that is he says that you have departed from the Gospel of Christ. And he was amazed by this fact. He was troubled by this fact and astonished that they were turning to a different gospel. Part of the the problem here was the the enmity that existed between Jews and Gentiles. And this was even happening among well known Christians. And so we see in chapter two, in verses 11 and 12, there are talks about safest when he came from Antioch, he with when he came before James, he was eating with the Gentiles. But when they came, he drew back and separated himself. And so there is well known occasions of Christians that were separating, they should have been united in their common faith. But we see that the Jews were separating or ignoring or pushing aside the Gentiles. And that was a problem. Part of the reason for this was a reliance upon the law, anyone who devotes themselves there to circumcision, and to the the works of the law, they are relying on the wall law. And Paul says that if you rely on the works of the law, that you're under a curse for it, as Kurt written curse would be everyone who does not abide by all things written in the book of the law. In chapter four and verse nine, he he describes this as worldly. They were following after what is worldly. This was not merely a doctrinal disputes, but this also had to do with their hearts. And so he says, They were going after worldly things. There were also those that were unsettling others. And one of the clearest descriptions of that was actually in our Bible reading today, in Galatians, six and verse 12, they were trying to force the law, or circumcision or other aspects of the law upon others, and bind that upon others. They were saying, in order to be a faithful Christian, you need to be able to do these other things as well. This is also seen in chapter five and verse 15, when it says that they were biting and devouring one another, biting and devouring one another. That's a vivid image, isn't it? That's an ugly picture of people that are hateful toward one another, that have a lack of concern for one another. And this was what was happening here among Galatians. And so Paul was upset about this. He was he was astonished, as he says, when he begins the letter. So there's clearly a problem in Galatians. When we read today, though, is is an attempt by Paul, I think, to address those things. In some ways. Galatians doesn't look like some of the other letters. But you also also say that he begins with the problem and then he has some practical advice toward the end of the book, just as he does in other letters that he's written. Notice if you would in Galatians, five verses 25 through six one. We're going to be looking at chapter six today and talking about bearing burdens. But notice what he says in chapter five and verse 25. I think this section goes together as we consider what he's trying to say in chapter six.

Jeremy Sweets  04:24
He says, If we live by the Spirit, let us also keep in step with the spirits. Let us not become conceited, provoking one another, envying one another. Brothers, if anyone is caught in any transgression, you who are spiritual should restore him in a spirit of gentleness, keep watch on yourself, lest you to be tempted. Some people have actually had a difficulty seeing the connection between chapter five and six and then all of these problems that are discussed, but I think what Paul is doing is addressing two key components that they needed to fix Hear, and that is they needed to have an accountability and a respect for one another. And also they had to examine themselves. And there was a personal responsibility that they needed to take. The heart of the gospel message really might say is looking out for others. But also looking out for yourself. I think this is Paul's message. Notice in this passage, some of the key things that bind us together. First of all, he says that we are to live by the Spirit. And if we are to live by the Spirit were to keep in step with the spirits. You may remember before this, what we read was The fruit of the spirits. If you are living according to the Spirit, you'll bring forth the fruit of the Spirit, you will act in a way that is according to the Spirit. And he says later, in chapter six and verse one, those who are spiritual should restore such a one should restore such a one. Now, that's quite different. The two cases that you see in 26 and chapter six, verse one, that's quite different directions isn't, in one case, those that are living according to the flesh, the works of the flesh, and all the inventory that is there. It says that they are conceded, they are provoking one another, they are in being one another. And so they have a problem with their own heart. And that spills out to how they deal with others, pushing others into sin. And so I hope you see the contrast that is there. That is one picture. But the spiritual person, the one led by the spirits, is not provoking and pushing others into sin. But instead they are trying to restore such a warn. Not only that, but he says, but also keep watch on yourself, keep watch on yourself. So it's through this, that we lead into chapter six and verse two, and we'll be looking at the subject of bearing burdens. Notice what he says in chapter six and verse two, Bear one another's burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ. You know, we all have burdens to bear don't we? Burden here really refers to a heavy weight. And so when you go to the gym or something, people try to lift up heavy weights. And we see that physical picture here, but it's yours more in a metaphorical sense of a problem, or a trial that we might face. And so for example, in the Old Testament, it talked about the the Hebrews, under the burden of the Egyptians, when they were in slavery, that was way they were burdened down. And so people today have problems, they have trials. And we can relate to that, can't we? We all experienced that. And so Paul says that, as Christians, you must be people that bear one another's burdens. Certainly we shouldn't be those that are adding to the burdens. We shouldn't be ones that are creating burdens for others, but instead we should be those that are bearing the burdens of others.

Jeremy Sweets  08:18
In the Amaya, if you uses this language, I think it's a good connection. Sometimes we might feel like those in the days of Nehemiah, it says in Judah, it was said the strength of those who bear the burdens is failing, there is too much trouble by ourselves, we will not be able to rebuild the wall. Do you see what they were saying? They were saying this burden is too great for us. And that's often how we feel about burdens. This is something that I cannot bear, I cannot stand and we are not able to do it really by ourselves, there is a great need for help. There is a great need from others. Christians have that obligation to help each other. It's not a solo religion. It is not merely one to be lived in isolation or disconnected from others. That is not the Christian way that is not living in the Spirit. But instead it is an obligation of Christians a responsibility of Christians to bear the burdens of others. Now there's many burdens we could talk about there aren't there. There's physical burdens, often physical things, the things of this life weigh us down. In fact, we see in Matthew chapter 25, verses 34 through 46, a judgement scene. And we see many people that are burdened with the the things of life it describes their the hungry, the thirsty, those that are without clothes, the naked, those that are sick, those that are in prison. And in that passage, Jesus says that you will be judged by how you dealt with those people because as you dealt with those that were hungry and thirsty, naked, sick and in prison, that's how you dealt with me. If we were to see Jesus Christ, I'm sure we would do everything we could to make a good impression, so to speak, to do what we could to serve him if we were to see him in the flesh. But Jesus says, You don't have to see me in the flesh to serve Me. You can serve me by helping others, bearing their burdens, giving food to the hungry, water to the thirsty clothing, those that are naked, helping those that are sick visiting them, and those that are in prison. So a question for us is, are we doing those things? Are we looking out so that we might help and bear the burden of others in a very physical way. And James one in verse 27, there talks about true religion is visiting the orphans, and widows to go and see, these are people that have some of the greatest needs in this life, in the ancient world, to be an orphan, or a widow would be to be one without support. And so they were left without sometimes their physical needs being met. And here, James says, to visit the orphans and widows, and so there's a very much a physical component in this bearing burdens, but we cannot overlook the spiritual components. I really think that chapter six and verse one is a specific case and then he moves to something general, talking about let us bear one another's burdens. But let us notice the spiritual burdens that people bear. Sin is really the greatest burden that we can bear. There is no greater in Psalm 38 And verse four, the Psalmist describes sin in this way. For him, my iniquities have gone over my head, like a heavy burden, they are too heavy for me.

Jeremy Sweets  12:08
And that's what sin can do. We can have a lot of burdens physically, but there is no greater burden than sin, it can weigh us down, it can be too much for us to handle. So notice that we can bear burdens also by addressing sin and others addressing sin. And so he says that if you were to do that, in chapter six and verse one, you are to restore such a one or to bring them back, you're to bring them back, there is an invitation here, there is a loving heart that extends open arms to others, there is a calling them back away from sin, to following after God, all that is necessary and essential. And so if we see sin and others, it is not the loving thing to do to simply ignore it. It is not the loving thing to do to say not my problem. But rather we should be spiritually minded, led by the Spirit and seek to restore such a one. We should be those that help others with dealing with sin, instead of pushing them in to sin. So let us be a people that bear burdens. And we can do that physically and spiritually. Notice what he says in verse two that this is a picture of, he says, Bear one another's burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ, fulfill the law of Christ. This is what Christ did. This is the message that he left for Christians, this is what he wants Christians to do, and that is to love one another. And earlier in this book, we see a picture of this and Galatians, 513 and 14. There it says For you are called the Freedom brothers only do not use your freedom as an opportunity for the flesh, but through love serve one another. For the whole law is fulfilled in one word, you shall love your neighbor as yourself. So again, I asked what is the loving thing to do? What did Jesus do that he ignores in? That he say not my problem? That's for them to deal with? Or did he give of himself in order to serve? Did he give his life to die on the cross so that others might have freedom, forgiveness of sins, we know that's what he did. He died for others. And so this law of Christ is a loving law. It is the loving thing to do to restore such a one to bring them back. And Romans 15 verses one through three it has a similar message. There it says we Who our strong have an obligation to bear with the failings of the weak and not to please ourselves. And we see a dispute there and maybe some understandings of the law as we go back to Romans 14 and 15. But here he says that we have an obligation to bear with others, to bear with their failings and not to please ourselves. He goes on to say, let each of us please his neighbor for his good to build him up. For Christ did not please himself. But as it is written, the reproaches of those who approached you fell on me. Notice we have an obligation to serve one another and not ourselves, because that's what Christ did. And so if we're to restore such a one and bear other's burdens, that fulfills the law of Christ that does what Christ did. And it does what we are to do as Christians, Christ did not please himself, and neither should we. But as we go on in this passage, in verses three through five, we see that there is a way that we are to restore others. I'm sure you can imagine two different ways that that could happen. Imagine how an arrogant person a self righteous person would restore another, how would they do it probably was snapping and saying, Get bright, do do what you need to do get straight without any love or compassion whatsoever. I'm doing what's right, that's what you need to do. And so there could be a harshness that's involved there.

Jeremy Sweets  16:42
But he says that you need to do this with humility, you need to be careful of your own heart, as you bear the burdens of others. Notice in verses three through five, for if anyone thinks he has something when he has nothing, he deceives himself, but let each one test his own work. And then his reason to boast will be in himself alone and not in his neighbor, for each will have to bear his own loan. And so he says that you need to have humility, not thinking that you are something not deceiving yourself in that way, recognizing your own need as well. And so we go back to that arrogant man and how he might restore one he might or store one with with harshness, with matter of fact, expectation without consideration of their situation or what they're trying to do. But instead, he says that you need to do so with humility, with humility. And we look back to six and verse one, he says that you who are spiritual should restore him in a spirit of gentleness. And so it matters how the restoration is to take place, how the burdens are to be born, we are to do that with humility, you might notice that gentleness is and looks back to one of those fruits of the spirit that we mentioned at the end of Galatians. Five. That is how people that are walking in the Spirit behave, that is how they live. That is the kind of attitude that they have. So he says you're not only to bear one another's burdens, but she also must bear your own loan, your own loan, the Christian faith is one of looking to others and helping others but we cannot bypass our own heart when we make those considerations. We cannot overlook our own hearts. Instead, we must be those that seek to help others, following after the very heart of God, having a humility of ourselves knowing that God is right, and we are all in need of his help. I want you to notice that there are really two ways that I see in this text that that deal with arrogance that arises and this is really a continuation of that point of, of practicing these things with humility. And so the first one I see is that we can take too much notice of our good works too much notice. And so we may be proud of the good that we are doing. Studies have shown that, that people often act toward charities or act in such a way because it makes them feel good. You know, the Bible warns us though, that that would be our only motivation, that we would feel good or that we would have others think good of us. That should not be why we do things. We see this in Matthew chapter six verses one through four. There Jesus says, Beware of practicing your righteousness before other people in order to be seen by them. For then you will have no reward from your Father who is in heaven. That's when you give to the needy sound no trumpet before as the hypocrites do in the synagogues and in the streets, that they may be praised by others, truly I say to you, they have received their reward. But when you give to the needy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing. So that you're giving may be a secrets, and your Father who sees in secret will reward you. Sometimes we take too much notice of our good works. Sometimes we let our left hand see what our right hand is doing. And we begin to pat ourselves on the back, we begin to say, look how good I am. I think this is one of the greatest dangers that Christians face. We've collected here, and we do this regularly as a group of people. We did what we were supposed to do, right? We sang songs, we came here we praise God, we are not like them out there. We begin to think to ourselves that we are the good ones. Those outside the walls are the bad ones. But the truth is, that's pure arrogance, isn't it? That is pure arrogance. And Christians need a large dose of humility. We need a large dose because first of all that's needed and being effective. Evangelist restores bringing others back, but it's also needed for our very own hearts. And so let us not become too enamored with ourselves, let us not forget what God has done for us. Let us not forget where we were.

Jeremy Sweets  21:39
We have been sinners in the sight of God, washed by his blood, given an extraordinary dose of His grace, let us never forget that let us not think that we are so great. Let us not boast in ourselves, but boasting God who has saved us. I know Mike has used this saying a lot I remember it from Joel Plunkett. preaching of the gospel is where one beggar tells another beggar where he got his bread. That's the attitude we all need to have as Christians. We're beggars before God. We're not kings, we're beggars. We're feasting on the bread. We're thankful for that. And we want to share it with others. This is not a place where we come here and say, Look how good we are and how bad they are. This is a place where we come say, look how great the need is. And look, where we get is from our goal. That's the attitude we have. And it is a great danger. For Christians when they do what is right. When they do what's right, for the wrong reasons. It's a great danger, the potential price as it can raise up in the heart of a Christian. So don't be proud of yourself. Don't have pride, be careful. So one thing we might do if we are not living with humility is we might take too much notice of our good works. Well, there's another side of that as well. And we may not take enough notice of our sin. So in chapter six and verse one, he says to those who are spiritual that they should restore such a one and a spirit of gentleness, says keep watch on yourself, lest you to be tempted. You know, it's a lot easier to find the problems and mistakes and other people. It's a lot easier to see their faults than it is our own. You know, we can we can make a quick list. Someone says what is wrong with this person while I'm ready. I've got my list down, I know exactly what they need to fix and what they need to do. But if someone were to ask us about our faults and failings, a lot of times we hide our head in the sand, don't we? Well, there might be something on Mike could work on. We deny it even to ourselves. It's difficult to deal with sin, isn't it? And so we must be a people that deal with it even in our own hearts. And so as we are helping others with their problems, let us not become arrogant in that either. And ignore our own failings and our own faults, our own sin. Sin is common to man as it says in first Corinthians chapter 10, verse 13, and that includes us. That includes us, the sins that are out there are things that we could fall to let us not be proud in thinking that we are so spiritual, that we would never do that. I have an illustration that sticks in my head on this point. You've probably heard it many times before. I'm going to tell it to you again and maybe some Haven't heard it. When I was in high school there was, we were camping with another Christian family. Her name was Linda spears, she the spears family was a great family still are in Lawrenceburg, Kentucky. And she was talking about a girl that had gotten pregnant in high school. And it was a sad situation. I mean, that's difficult for someone to get pregnant at such a young age, and have to deal with that tremendous amount of responsibility. And I said, in all my pride and arrogance, that would never happen to me. Now I know I can't get pregnant, but you understand the situation I'm setting out, I would never impregnate a girl, that would never happen to me. And she stopped me and said, Don't be too sure. Boy, I needed that. I needed to step off my high horse and say, that would never be me. And she needed to tell me yes, that could be you. That could be you. Let us not be cavalier with sin. So that could never happen to me. We categorize sins, good ones and bad ones. That was clearly a bad one, especially for my high school self. That was something I would never do. Let us never be cavalier with sin that could happen to us. Let us not fail to take notice of our sins. We have our own load to bear. We have our own load to bear. So let us be careful. And Barrett.

Jeremy Sweets  26:36
Let me also add and Paul doesn't make this point directly. But I think it's it's very clear from from the text that we need a reliance upon God. So if we're talking about burdens, there are things that we cannot handle by ourselves. What Paul talks about bearing the burdens of others, and bearing our own burden is always in the context of what God has done for us and our reliance and need upon Him. We need to entrust our burdens to God. In Psalm 55 And verse 22. There it says, Cast your burdens on the Lord and He will sustain you, He will never permit the righteous to be moved. In first Peter five, verses six and seven. There it says Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God so that at the proper time, he may exalt you, Casting all your anxieties on Him because He cares for you. God can handle our burden. God is big enough, powerful enough, strong enough to handle our burdens, and we need to cast them upon Him. We need not have this bootstrap theology where we think we can do it all on our own. This is all we need is ourselves. We simply have to try harder. No, we need God. We need God. Let us not discount our great need for God let us not discount our need for walking in the Spirit being led by the Spirit living in a way that he would have us to live. We need to entrust ourselves to God because there are consequences. If we do not we see this later in the text and Galatians six verses seven and eight. Do not be deceived. God is not mocked. For whatever one sows that will he also read, for the one who sews to his own flesh will from the flesh rape corruption, but the one who sews to the spirit will from the Spirit reap eternal life. We need to entrust ourselves to God and his spirits and walk in the spirits and not in the flesh. burdens are a real thing. And they need to be dealt with. So let us bear one another's burdens, bear our own load and entrust our burdens to God. Let me close with some lessons that we might learn from this by way of summary and review as we look at what we've been talking about. First of all, we need to focus on others. Christians are people that look not only for their own interests, but also for the interests of others. We follow the example of Jesus Christ who gave of himself in order to serve other people. As Christians, we have to focus on other people look to other people seek to help other people help them. We also need to be people that do not overlook sin. That's true and other people. You know, it's easier to act like sins not happening or to ignore it. It's easier not to address it and other people. It's easier to keep our relationships superficial so that we talk about the weather and sports but we never get into deeper spiritual matters. It's easier not to deal with the ugliness of sin. But let us not overlook sin. It's easier to do that with ourselves as well to turn a blind eye to sin and act like certainly that's not something I need to deal with. While I say it's easier, it's easier in the short run, isn't it? It ends up being a growing avalanche, that snowball that gets bigger and bigger until we can't deal with it anymore. Let us not be a people that overlook sin. Let us watch out for spiritual pride. And I think this is one of the greatest dangers of Christians, we are the good ones, we are the right ones. Well, we need to change that attitude. We are the ones that have been blessed by Almighty God. And we need to be humble, ever humble. And we need to be careful of pride that can arise in the heart of a Christian. We need to be motivated by love. I think this will determine how we treat other people. How will we respond to their sins, we can do that in arrogance and self righteousness. So we can do that in humility and love, seeking not to show I'm better than you and you need to get this right. But rather, I'm genuinely concerned for you, I love you, I want what is good and right for you. And so those are two different approaches to dealing with the sin and other people.

Jeremy Sweets  31:14
We need to be motivated by love. We need to be motivated, just like Christ was just like God was, For God so loved the world that He gave His only Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish. We need the love of God in our hearts, and to be able to extend that to other people. We should not get too tired of doing good. One of the passages that I meant to talk about in covers at the end of Galatians, or the latter part of the text that we looked at, as you bear other people's burdens. Notice what he says in verse nine. And let us not grow weary of doing good for in due season we will reap if we do not give up. So then as we have opportunity, let us do good to everyone and especially to those who are the household of faith. You know, I love this image because we we look at burdens, burdens are heavy, aren't they? They're tiresome. But notice what he says that Christians are to do. Don't get weary, don't get tired of doing what is right. Now, when you deal with sin and deal with those things and help other people and get into the messiness of people's lives, you may be physically tired. You may need to rest a little bit after that. I'm not saying you won't get physically tired. But let us not give up on it. Let us not emotionally say this is too much for me or I'm retiring from my Christian service I've done enough I'm going to let other people take over let us never grow weary of doing good. And who should we do good to the passage tells us I think we're dealing a lot with internally, those that are Christians, those that have erred, we're storing them and bearing their burdens, but it also includes all people. As we have an opportunity. Let us do good to all people. God does not restrict his grace to a few select people, hand picking them out and saying only you can have my grace. Now he freely offers it to all whosoever will. Let us do good. In every opportunity we can find to those outside the faith those inside the faith. Let us be also reminded that you will reap what you sow, you will reap what you sow. If you live after the flesh, if you live in selfishness, if you follow after sin, you will reap what you sow. And it may not be in this life. There's a lot of frustrations that people have, it seems like the wicked prosper. Why is that? Well, I don't know all the answers to that and what happens in this life, but I do know this, you will reap what you sow. If you turn your back on God, he will turn his back on you in the judgments, he'll be faithful to himself. It's also true that if you sow the spirits, the fruit of the Spirit, that is what you'll reap in this life, and in the next heaven awaits. What a glorious thoughts. No, I think Galatians is a great book to learn from and so I hope I brought forward some points that are helpful to you. If you're here this morning and you're not a Christian, you have an opportunity to obey the gospel message, believing that Jesus is the Christ repenting of your sins, confessing that Jesus is the Christ and being baptized in the water for the forgiveness of your sins. That requires a humble heart. Eric Have faith in God. refire requires an attitude of gratefulness to God for what He has done. And then you respond to that, and you commit your life. That's what's required to become a Christian. You become humble and dependent upon God and you acknowledge that. It may be that you're one that has erred. And you can do that in many different ways. You can do that by leaving the church, leaving the faith wandering away and not wanting to have anything to do with God. And that's clearly a walking away. I'm not talking to anyone here today like that. I don't think that has been away. You're here and listening to me. But you can also come here and smile and look nice and happy before others but still harbor sin in your hearts. That's a dangerous place to be. So if you have any need any need in your life, use this opportunity to do what is right if you're not a Christian, become one. If you're not living as a Christian, even though you've made the commitment, then make changes. There's any subject to the invitation please come as we stand and sing at this time.
