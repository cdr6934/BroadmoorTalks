It's good to see you again tonight. So he's a blessing when we can study God's Word and meet together to encourage each other if you want to open up your Bibles to Proverbs The 30 of chapter. Proverbs chapter 38. The largest winning jackpot in the history of the lottery was handed out in January of 2016 $1.6 billion. And there was actually three tickets that had the winning numbers. And one of those was from a couple that lives here in Tennessee and Mumford. And their names were John and Lisa Robinson. And the winners were given an option, they could take a lump sum payments of $320 $320 million, or they could have an annuity of $533 million. And that would be spread out for a longer period of time. And John, and Lisa decided to take the lump sum, as John said, we're not guaranteed tomorrow. So they just took the full amount right there. But we, as Americans, it's estimated that half of Americans bought at least one lottery ticket in the previous year. And we are obsessed with this idea of, of wealth. Winning the lottery is extremely rare, and yet buying lottery tickets is extremely common. And so the question of why would people continue to engage in something that offers almost zero chance of providing any kind of return? Or benefits? I think one of the reasons is because we are infatuated with we are obsessed with the idea of wealth, we like to imagine ourselves we like to think about put ourselves in the shoes of John and Lisa Robinson, what would we do with all of that money?

Conrad Harkrider  02:16
We picture the big house and the fancy cars, and a life with no bills and a house on the beach. As one behavior expert noted, people are in love with hope. We love to imagine what our situation could be. And so we have these picturesque dreams of inheriting a lot of money or winning great sums of money. You know, the Bible has a lot to say about money. Money is not good or bad. It's like the sun is the sun good or bad? Well, the sun, we have to have the sun. It provides the light in order for food and plants to grow. It allows us to see when we're walking around, it warms the earth, it's it's a good thing. But at the same time, what happens if you stare directly at the Sun? Can it damage your eyes? Or what about if you spend long periods of time out in the sun without any protection, it can burn you, it can cause dehydration, it could ultimately kill you. And so whether it is a good or bad thing depends on the context. And so it is with money, whether it is an asset or a snare really depends on how it's being used. Tonight we're going to look at a passage from Proverbs, Where the writer offers some very timely wisdom and he asked God he makes a request to the Lord. And he asks that God would give him neither poverty nor riches. So let's think about that together for just a few moments. Read with me in Proverbs chapter 30, beginning in verse five. It says every word of God is pure. He is a shield to those who put their trust in Him. Do not add to his words, lest he rebuke you, and you'll be found a liar. Two things I request of you deprive me not before I die, remove falsehood and lies far from me. Give me neither poverty nor riches, feed me with the food allotted to me, lest I be full and deny you and say who is the Lord, or lest I be poor and steal, and profane the name of my God? The book of Proverbs is a collection of wise sayings attributed to Solomon and chapter 25 And verse one, we're given some insight into how the book was compiled when it tells us that these proverbs of Solomon were collected and recorded by the men of Hezekiah king of Judah. There's about 250 years between salt Solomon and Hezekiah. But at some point, the writings were put together into a single work. Solomon is the main writer of Proverbs. But he's not the only writer of Proverbs as we see here in chapter 30. Look at verse one. This is attributed. It says the words of Edgar the son of Jacob. Now, we don't know much about agar, other than he was the son of Jacob. But we can see some things about his approach about his attitude from the things that he writes here in chapter 30. And notice what he says in verse two, surely I am more stupid than any man, and do not have the understanding of a man. I neither learned wisdom, nor have knowledge of the holy one. That is a very unusual starting place for someone who's going to dispel wisdom, can you imagine if you walked into a college class, and the professor started off by saying that he was stupid, and that he knew nothing, not necessarily a class that you think you're going to learn a lot from them. But I think what he's saying here is that he is showing his humility. He is emphasizing the fact that without God, he knows nothing. Without the Lord without God's wisdom, he is at a place of emptiness. And so he depends on God, and His ways. And really, that's the first step in, in gaining knowledge, and gaining wisdom. And understanding how we should live or walk in this life is to empty ourselves to say, we don't have all the answers. We don't know what the direction or how we should walk in this life. And we need to turn to God's wisdom. And that's for how we live our lives for how a person becomes a Christian, for our relationships, and even for how we view and use our money in this life. Well, Edgar asks for two things. He says in verse seven, two things I request of you. This is a poetic style that is used throughout the rest of the chapter. Edgar seems to be a numbers guy. Look at verse 18. He says, There are three things which are too wonderful for me. Yes, for which I do not understand. Also, notice verse 24. He says, there are four things which are little on Earth, but they are exceedingly wise. This proverb in verse seven through nine is the first of the numerical proverbs that he will give here. And notice that this is a prayer that he offers, it is a request that he is making to the Lord, He is asking God, for these two things. It's not entirely clear what the two things are, they could be. The first thing is that the Lord would remove falsehood and lies. And then number two, that he would give him neither poverty, nor riches, or the two things could be that God would grant him neither poverty, nor riches, it's not entirely clear what the two but regardless, it still says the same thing, the point is the same. And notice what he says in verse eight. He says, remove falsehood and lies, he wants, things that are false, he wants dishonesty to be taken away. And did you notice the distance, the the amount of space between him and in dishonesty, he says, For it to be taken far away from me? He doesn't want any kind of appearance, or any type of association with those things. This idea of dishonesty or falsehood or lying, seems to be connected back to what he says in verse six. Look at verse six, do not add to his words, lest he rebuke you, and you be found a liar. Those who add to God's words, those who twist what God has said, Those who change God's words, did you notice what he called them, he said, they are a liar. And Edgar wants that type of thing to be completely removed from his life, so that he would be the type of person that can fake that can faithfully and honestly handle God's words. He says that these things would be removed from him. He then goes on to ask or pray that the Lord would give him neither poverty nor riches, and that's where we're going to spend the rest of our time tonight. Think about this prayer that God would give a person that God would allow a person not to be poor, we can understand that. But also that God would not cause a person to be rich. And I think when we start talking about the terms poverty and riches or, or poor and wealthy, we need to sort of step back. And remember that those terms are used in the context of whatever culture we live in, or whatever period of time that we might be living in. For example, standards of wealth can change drastically what's considered to be poor in this country, might be middle class, in another part of the world, you'd be living in this country, and you have electricity and you have running water, and you have cable and you've got food to eat, and you've got clothes, and yet, by our standards, you are considered to be living in poverty. And the same is true for those who are rich. Right? When we think about someone who is rich, who comes to mind, it's not Conrad, hopefully it's not. It's the person who's got 20,000 square foot house indoor basketball court and the indoor swimming pool and the house sits up on the bluff overlooking the ocean, that person is rich. And so it's just important for us to kind of pause and think about our perception, which side do we sit on here? When we think about? Well, you know, I'm not asking God to be rich, we may already be in a position of great physical blessing, and wealth, but agar Here he goes on to explain what this means. He says, in verse eight, he says, feed me with the food allotted to me.

Conrad Harkrider  11:52
He says, I want you to give me what I need. I want you to bestow upon me my portion what is needful for me. You remember in the Lord's Prayer, when Jesus was teaching his disciples how to pray, and he said, When you pray, ask God to give us this day, our daily bread. And the idea is that we are being filled or satisfied that we are relying upon God, we are accepting from God, our portion, and that we are depending upon him, we look to Him, we trust in Him, we see him as our source of good that he's providing for our needs. Think about also the children of Israel, when they were wandering around in the wilderness. Do you remember what God told them to do? When he would send the manna for them in the mornings, they would go out and they would collect that. And he said that they were only to gather up enough for a single day. And you think, Well, what was the point of that? Why couldn't they just get enough for the whole week or for the whole month, or for whatever period of time that they were going to be traveling, but instead, they did it day, by day, God was teaching them to trust him to rely upon him to, to know that that next day that God, they were going to have to entrust or know that he would be the one that was providing for them. In verse nine, Edgar gives some of the outcomes. Or the end result if, if he heads down the path of poverty, or if he heads down the path of riches, what might be the outcome, what might ultimately happen? And he says, with riches, he might become full. He might, it might cause him to turn away from God. He says, I might even say who is God, who is the Lord that, that I need him, he's displaying this attitude of arrogance or pride that I'm self sufficient. I don't need God, I have everything that I want. But on the other side of this, if he falls into poverty, then he might be tempted to steal, he might be tempted to dishonor God's name. And that's interesting. Notice that even if someone has a what we would consider valid reason, doing evil is is not okay, doing evil is never okay. And so he says he doesn't want to be in that situation because it would be a greater, a greater burden, a greater temptation for him to do what's right, to act honorably, to do the right thing. There are so many lessons we can learn from this short prayer. But the first one I'd like for us to consider is just thinking about seeking for balance and contentment. That's really what what I saw in this in this prayer is that he is looking for a middle state he is looking for a state of of balance and really a place of contentment, where he is thankful where He is grateful for what God has given him balance is a financial term, we talk about the balance in the checking accounts, people used to balance a checkbook. I don't know that many people do that anymore. But the idea was that you wanted to see what was going out and what was coming in to make sure that you had enough money to cover your expenses. And a similar sentiment is being expressed here. He doesn't want to be down at zero overdrafting, the account writing checks that aren't good, but but also he doesn't want to have so much excess, that it is causing him to turn his back on God, it's hindering his relationship with God, he wants to find a balance, he wants to be in a place where he can provide for his needs, but not in a place that's going to hinder him or cause him to stumble. In regards to serving God. I think most of us can pretty, pretty well sympathize with the prayer of not wanting to be in poverty, if you've ever had a situation where you lost a job or you know, someone that that was an unemployed for a certain period of time, you know, that can be really stressful for a family. And there's a lot of praying that happens and a lot of worrying that goes on. And we are fervently asking God and asking others to try to help us with that to, to make it through that situation to be able to find another place of employment and praying that God will open a door of opportunity, we can understand that sentiment. But what about the prayer to not become too rich?

Conrad Harkrider  16:45
I mean, if you ever really thought about that, have you ever prayed that God would stop giving you more money, that you wouldn't get a promotion or that it's the end of the year, and the bonuses are about to come out and you say, you know, Lord, I just don't know that I need any more this sheet here. I mean, that doesn't make any sense to us, we usually think of, if there's money on the table, then you should take it. And bigger is better. We want to keep moving up. We want to keep progressing, we want to keep growing. But it's interesting to think about this idea of being content where you are, and finding balance in how we view and think about our money. You know, we've all heard and seen examples of people who obtain a large sum of money, they inherit money, or they get a huge promotion, or there's something that they're working on, they have a job or a business or something that just takes off and does really well. And all of a sudden they come into a large sum of money. And it changes them. It changes their personality, it changes their attitude, it changes their focus. The people they spend time with the way that they act, it just it changes who they are, and we can see that. But then we think about ourselves, and we're like, Yeah, but I still want the money. You know, I if it's not going to change me, Okay, I think I can handle it. I'll just be more generous,

Conrad Harkrider  18:18
I'll give more money away. You know, I think I'm up to the challenge. But that's not really how money works. When we make money, our goal, when we put money at the center of our life, our focus what we're most concerned about, it just leads to desiring more and more and more. It's like climbing down into the quicksand. It's just a never ending cycle that it's it's very difficult to get out of Ecclesiastes chapter five and verse 10. Solomon, the writer again says he who loves money will not be satisfied with money, nor he who loves wealth with his income, this also is vanity. The more money we have, the more money we tend to want the money. Increasing money doesn't cause us to be satisfied. It just makes us want more. Have you ever seen this happen around the holidays around a birthday party or special times where we're doing presents, you take a little kid and you put them in the center of attention, you start putting the gifts in front of them and the 1015 gifts, and they start opening them and they open the first one, they look at it for a few minutes and they say okay, what's next? And then they open the second one. And they look at that for a few minutes. I say what's next? And then the third one, and then after a few minutes, they've rifled through all the presents. And they're they're done. And they're thinking and they're saying what's next? And then they have dozens of toys sitting here in the room. And we've seen this happen You look over to the side, and they have crumpled up the wrapping paper into a ball. And now they're playing with it. And you're thinking next year, that's just, that's what we're going to get him, we'll just wrap up some wrapping paper, and they can play with that. But this, this idea of, you know, we are, in many ways, just like children, we get the new phone, and we think this is great, and it's new. And then after a while, we say what's next. And then we, we buy a new car, and it smells nice, and it drives great. And after a few months, it starts to wear off and we're thinking, What's next, we upgrade the house, or we do decorations, or we remodel. And it's just more and more and more we stack it on top of itself. And a lot of times, the way I'm thinking is that well once I do x, then I'll be good, I'll be set once we complete this project or, or go about and do this, then we'll be good to go. But it just keeps happening again and again. In Proverbs 30 In verse 15. In the same chapter, he says the leech has two daughters give and give. And isn't that the way that materialism works? You know, it's one weekend we go and we shop and we spend, and we get everything that we think we need or want. And a couple of weeks go by, and then it's back into the same cycle we're looking to obtain, and have more, we really what we need to focus on is balance, this idea of moderation, of, of being content with what we have, or being grateful of being thankful of looking around and saying, God has given us way more, so much more abundantly than we could ever ask, and, and really reflecting on and being thankful for those blessings. You know, the Bible doesn't teach that we should live in poverty. The Bible doesn't command us to sell all of our possessions and live as as poor people, depending on others. But at the same time, the Bible doesn't teach that our our goal, our central focus in life is just to obtain as much money as we possibly can to gain as much power and influence and wealth, that that is our primary focus. We instead we need to be seeking for balance, and finding our joy and our happiness, and our fulfillment not in things in this world not

Conrad Harkrider  22:34
in possessions, but instead in true eternal blessings. So how do we view our money? How do we think about our priorities is money. Our top goal is that the number one thing that we're working towards, that we're thinking about? Again, Edgar would say that we need to find somewhere in the middle. And second Corinthians chapter eight and verse nine. It says, For you know, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, that though he was rich, yet for your sake, he became poor, so that you by his poverty might become rich. Jesus had all wealth. He was in heaven, he had been blessed. He had all power and authority and rule and yet he was willing to give those things up. Because he loved God and God's plan and God's will. And he loved us more than his position. And he was willing to set those things to the side. And so as we think about our attitude towards possessions and wealth, what is it that we think that the, that is at the top of our list that we are pursuing in this life, we need balance? Also, from this text, there is a warning about the dangers of wealth, and we need to be aware of those dangers. And verse nine, it says, lest I be full and deny you and say, Who is the Lord? Have we thought about the fact that money, that money could lead us away from God? Money could cause us to lose our relationship with the Lord. And I'm not talking about that we stop coming to church. I guess there's a sense in that that person gets a lot of money and they start, you know, stop coming to worship. They're eating brunch on Sunday mornings, instead of coming here. That can happen but what I'm referring to is something that's more subtle, something that happens on the inside, where externally, things still look the same, that we still come to church and we are nice and friendly and on the outside it looks normal, but inside we are being swallowed up. There is this greed and this covetousness that is eating through us in Matthew chapter 23 In verse 25, it says Woe to you scribes and Pharisees Hypocrites. For you clean the outside of the Up in the plate, but inside there are full of greed and self indulgence. Jesus says that these are he speaking? Did you notice to the scribes and the Pharisees, these are the teachers of the law. The Pharisees are from the strictest sect of Judaism. And yet all the while they are being consumed with this greed and this self indulgence, when we read about the children of Israel, and how they were constantly being trapped in idolatry, but the children, the people that lived around them, they were always being influenced by their foreign gods, and they were falling into the cultures and the practices of the people that were around them. And we want to scratch our heads. And we think, why would they give up the true God? Why would they give up the Lord for these idols for these statues, these lifeless images, it doesn't make any sense. And yet we find ourselves bowing down, metaphorically to our own idols today, money, possessions, wealth, those things can become our idle, the thing that we are pursuing that we're worshiping, that we're longing for. And while that's happening, what we are drawing towards our possessions, and we are moving away from God, as Jesus said, You cannot serve God, and money. Money causes us, it can cause us to rely on ourselves to take our security and our assurance, to find those things in our possessions, to think about our our position in life, and to be comfortable because we have a bank account, or insurance or a good job, or a pension or retirement or whatever it may be. That's where we start to find our security. And as he says, here in this prayer, he becomes full. And he says, Who is the Lord? Why do I need the Lord, why don't need to trust the Lord, if I've got the situation taken care of here in this life.

Conrad Harkrider  27:13
One afternoon, Jessica was getting dinner together for the family. And so I took the kids for a walk out on the street, and we use the double stroller because everybody wanted to come. And I didn't realize how hot it was. That day, it was middle, it was the hottest part of the day, the sun was beating down. And to make matters worse, we live at the top of the hill. So the last part of the walk is all uphill. Well, as we were growing up, the two year old asked if she could help. And so she got out of the stroller and came back around next to me. When we got back to the house, my wife asked how it went. And I'm dripping and sweat, breathing heavy, borderline heatstroke. And I'm getting ready to give my summary of of the of the event. And the two year old jumps in. And she says I pushed the stroller up the big hill. And I looked at her and I was thinking No, you didn't. She might have helped a little. But to take credit for something like that. Don't we do the same thing with God. We look at our position we look at our accomplishments, we look at our skills and abilities. And we think look how hard I've worked for these things. Look how well I've done. Look at all that I've accomplished. Look at what I've made for myself. And all the while God is standing right behind us. And he's pushing us up the hill and wondering why we are not recognize honoring and giving him glory for all that he's given to us. Moses warned the Israelites about this as they were going into the Promised Land God is about to give them their land. And he says in Deuteronomy, chapter eight and verse 17, beware lest you say in your heart, my power, and the might of my hand have gotten me this wealth. You shall remember the Lord your God for it is he who gives you power, to get wealth. It's important for us to give God credit to give him praise. And we can do that in our prayers. We did it tonight in our songs, but ultimately it's an attitude. On an on a daily basis. Do we have the mindset of giving glory to God for all that he's done for us? Money is not evil. Just as high rock formations are not evil, but there are inherent dangers that are associated with it. We need to be careful and mindful of those dangers. And finally, as we close tonight We need to remember to invest in the right place. We need to be thinking about investing our money, investing our time investing our house, our wealth, our car, whatever it may be in the right place. In finance, personal finance, you always hear about gaining a return. You don't want to just keep your money sitting in a checking account, you want to put it in a place where you can gain some type of return or interest. And so it is, in spiritual terms, we need to be putting our money in the right places. Jesus said in Matthew six and verse 20, lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroy, and where thieves do not break in and steal. For where your treasure is there your heart will be also, are we storing up treasures in an in an eternal place? Are we making deposits in heaven? When people think about us and the way that we conduct ourselves? Do they see us as people who are generous? Do they look to us as people who are willing to give ready to share that are our homes that are wallets that are how we are with our time that those things are open, that we are freely willing to share and to help with other people. God's people, especially those who live in the wealthiest country in the world, should be known for their generosity, for their willingness to share for their willingness to help other people, not just at certain times of the year, when generosity and kindness and benevolence is being talked about, but an ongoing, consistent effort to help those around us. While hope those things have challenged you as they have me, we're going to close tonight with a song as we think about our relationship with God if there's something that we can do to encourage you, in your walk with the Lord, whatever that may be. We want to help you tonight. If you have a need please come down to the front as we stand and sing
