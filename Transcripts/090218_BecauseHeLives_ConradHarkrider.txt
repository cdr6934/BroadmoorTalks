If you have your Bibles, we'll be opening up to First Corinthians chapter 15.

Our lesson tonight is going to center around the song that we just sang. Because he lives. Have you ever thought about that? Because Jesus lives What does that mean to you? The resurrection is the greatest truth that has ever been told in this world. But what is the impact to your life? What does it mean? What is the significance to you because he lives. Bill and Gloria Gaither published this song in 1971, and it has since become one of the most popular hymns of our generation. One hymnal editor remarked that at one time, it was it was one of the top five most requested hymns to be included in hymnbooks. It has been recorded by various artists and has been sung countless times over. What did Bill and Gloria Gaither have in mind when they wrote this beloved him? Well, to answer that question, you have to take your mind back to the 1960s a time when I was not alive, but many of you were. It was a time of great difficulty and stress in our country. The Vietnam War was had been raging on for years. The racial tensions in the country were at an all time high. The assassination of public figures was becoming a common occurrence. Things were very difficult and uncertain. The gators also, were dealing with their own issues bill, the husband was struggling with a ongoing personal illness. It was during that time that his wife Gloria found out that she was expecting their third child perfect timing. When asked about writing the song Gloria recalled the fear and the anxiety that she felt thinking about having another baby coming into this world, what kind of a life were they going to have? What type of future would they have? Living in this world? The second verse of the song says, How sweet to hold a newborn baby and feel the pride and joy he gives. But greater still the calm assurance, this child can face uncertain days, because he lives. That's one of the things that I've never really thought about growing up singing this song is verse two. But as you when you have children, you realize that one of the top things on your mind is the concern, the worry, the uncertainty, the questions, thinking about what's going to happen to them down the road, are they going to be safe? are they're going to make good friends? Are they going to make good choices? Are they going to grow up and serve the Lord? This world is a dark place. But the song focuses on this calm assurance that we can have the overwhelming and unchangeable peace that can exist inside of the heart of God's people, because he lives. So I want us to think about this for just a few moments. And we're going to start in First Corinthians chapter 15, where Paul talks about the resurrection. Read with me in First Corinthians, chapter 15. In verse one,

Conrad Harkrider  04:15
it says, Moreover, brethren, I declare to you the gospel which I which I preached to you, which also you received, and in which you stand, by which you also are saved, if you hold fast that word, which I preached to you unless you believed in vain. For I delivered to you first of all, that which I also received, that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, and that He was buried and that he rose again the third day according to the Scriptures. Paul starts in verse one by saying that this was something that he had already declared to them. He is writing to them to remind them of these things. And that's how our minds often work. We need reminders, we need to be told, again, we need someone to bring up the troops, and the things that we have come to know. But we need to hear them again. Paul wanted to remind them of the gospel, the good news, the message that they had received. And why was this truth so important to their lives? Verse two says, because this is what was going to save them, this was their salvation. And so he encourages them, to hold onto this to keep it close to them, and to not let it go. What was the message that they had received? Verse three, Paul says, This message was of first importance. It was something that was primary, it was key to their faith that Christ died for their sins that he was buried, and then he rose again, on the third day. In the following verses after verse four, Paul then testifies about all the witnesses who saw Jesus after He was risen. And the point of this is to say that this is not just a fairy tale, not just some made up story, but this is verifiable, that there are actual eyewitnesses who saw the Lord. He starts with see fists or Peter. And then he says, he appeared to the 12, the disciples, and then it was to a congregation of over 500 brothers at one time. This gives us confidence that the resurrection is a real event. Many of the people who Paul describes here, gave their testimony and were willing to die on the basis of that testimony to defend its legitimacy. Jesus Christ was crucified, he came out, he was buried, but then three days later came out of the tomb. And it is Christianity on this basis, it centers on this fact on the resurrection. You cannot be forgiven of your sins. You can't have a relationship with God. You can't have hope in this world without the resurrection. It is the focal point of our faith because he lives that's why we're here tonight. Everything that we do our faith, our religion, our worship, to God centered on the resurrection. Because Jesus overcame Death. Our life has meaning and significance and purpose. And we serve a God who is living and his son lives and reigns at his right hand. So what is the resurrection of Jesus Christ? What does that fact mean to you? Because he lives this song says that I can face tomorrow. Because he lives I can face tomorrow. You know, it's a sad reality that many people living today feel like they can't go on. Like there is no tomorrow. There's no future, there's no hope. People become discouraged. And discouragement leads to depression. And depression can cause a person to sink lower and lower, they pull back from everything, until the point where they feel like there's no point they are dreading waking up the next day.

Conrad Harkrider  08:52
are God's people immune from those types of feelings because we have faith in the Lord does that relieve us from all types of discouragement? And, and difficulty? Even the Son of God felt extreme pressure when he was in the garden before his arrest? Jesus told his disciples in Mark chapter 14 And verse 32, it says, And when they went to the place called guest seminary, he said to his disciples, Sit here while I pray. And he took with him Peter and James and John and began to be greatly distressed and troubled. And he said to them, My soul is very sorrowful, even to death. Remain here and watch. And going a little further, going a little farther. He fell on the ground and prayed that if it were possible, the hour might pass from him. And he said, I'm a father all things are possible for you. Remove this cup from me. Yet not what I will but what you will. Jesus Mark tells us that he was greatly distressed and troubled. It says that his sorrow his soul was sorrowful even to the point of death. These are human emotions. Even though Jesus had tremendous power, he still was subjected to worry and to fear and to anxiety and doubt. What about the apostle Paul, he preached with incredible boldness. He took the Word of God all throughout the world, proclaiming the message about Christ. But even this great ambassador had moments of despair and fear. in second Corinthians chapter one, in verse eight, it says, For we do not want you to be unaware of brothers of the affliction that we experienced in Asia, for we were so utterly burdened beyond our strength, that we despaired of life itself. Indeed, we felt that we had received the sentence of death, despairing of life, itself, receiving the sentence of death. These are not words of happiness and optimism. This is, this is real life. And this is what the world with all of its evil can do to a person. We need to see that having these emotions is not unusual or abnormal or even ungodly. But it is a part of being here on this earth. And the Psalm has given us a clearer picture a true picture into the heart of some of God's messengers and some of God's servants, as they wrestle with their struggles in Psalm 40, in verse 12, David is writing. And he says, For evils, having compass me beyond number, my iniquities have overtaken me and I cannot see they're more than the hairs of my head, my heart fails me. This world can leave a person in a state of utter hopelessness. But this is the great truth that we hold on to, because he lives I can face tomorrow. And what that says, despite what is going on around me, all that has happened, or that is going to come before me, we can go on we can put our feet on the floor, and continue to live our lives, not because of our own power, or strength or ability, but because he lives. We can press forward. How did these servants of God, how did they make it through these ordeals? Mark tells us that Jesus went and prayed not just once, but three times. He petitioned for God's help for his strength. He asked that God's will would be done not his own. When we are facing challenges, and difficulty, do we continually seek the Lord in prayer? Do we humbly ask that His will might be done?

Conrad Harkrider  13:26
Paul in second, Corinthians, said that all of these things were happening to him for this reason. Second Corinthians one and verse nine, he said, Indeed, we felt that we had received the sentence of death. But that was to make us rely not on ourselves, but on God who raises the dead. When we try to face tomorrow, or face, whatever struggle might be in front of us, when we place our confidence, and rely on ourselves, we are putting our trust in the wrong place. Instead, our hope and our trust should be in the Lord and in His power. A few years ago, I was helping a brother and his family move out of his house. And one of the last items that had to come out was the washing machine and it just so happened that it was upstairs. And because I was one of the younger backs that had shown up that day, I got volunteered to be the guy who was going down backwards with this thing. And as we got to the front door, our hands started to slip my hands started to slip. And eventually we dropped it on the front steps on the concrete and it put a huge dent in the side of the washer. Unfortunately, free movers don't come with insurance, or training for that matter. better. But you want to know what the problem was with that situation. We were relying on our own strength. We didn't use a dolly, we didn't ask for help. We didn't reach, stop and reposition, and ask another person who is there to lend a hand or to provide assistance. Paul says that they were going through this struggle. And it happened to them to teach them something. So that they would not rely on their own strength on themselves, but that they would rely on God. And the lesson for us is to not wait to the last minute, where things are slipping out of control where we feel like we are about to break and think we're losing control, but instead, to turn to the Lord, to lean on his people to reach out to others. And to realize that maybe God is using this experience to cause us to depend on him. David concludes Psalm 40, by saying in Psalm 40, in verse 17, he says, As for me, I am poor and needy, but the Lord takes thought for me, you are my help and my deliverer Do not delay, oh, my God, our deliverance, and our help ultimately comes from the Lord. I can face tomorrow, not I can face the next 10 years. Not I can face the next 30 years, or the rest of my life, but I can face tomorrow. And I think what that saying is that we we need to take one day at a time, focus on the current challenges, we don't need strength. For the rest of our time here on Earth. We need strength for today for the challenges that are currently present one day at a time knowing that God will be with us through it all. Because he lives all fear is gone. Because he lives all fear is gone. What is it that you fear the most? When asked that question, Americans come up with all sorts of things. They fear, spiders and bugs, they fear being up high. They fear needles, they fear public speaking. And those are fears, but maybe not with very serious implications. But there are things that we fear that do have real consequences. The fear of a loved one getting sick, the loss of a job, the rejection or disapproval of others, our own mortality. These things can cause us to be gripped with fear. And once again, we see in the scriptures that God's servants are not immune to these things.

Conrad Harkrider  18:03
They're not void of fear and distress. But what makes God's people unique is our response to those emotions. David was constantly on the run, seeking refuge for his life, going from place to pray place. In Psalm 56. We're told that David had been seized by his enemies, the Philistines he was in GAF. But notice what he says Psalm 56 And verse three, when I am afraid, I put my trust in you, in God whose word I praise and God I trust, I shall not be afraid. What can flesh do to me? David doesn't say I have no fear. I'm never fearful. But he says when I am afraid, I put my trust in you. At the very end of verse four, he asked the question, What can flesh do to me? What do you mean, David, you are, you're in the presence of your captors. You have been detained by your enemies. They could persecute you, they could torture you they could put you to death. And yet he says what can they do? What can flesh do to me? Because our Savior lives there is something that we possess that cannot be touched by this world. And because it is preserved and protected, it gives us great confidence flesh, and this world cannot affect it. One year for his birthday, my brother got this little lockbox safe so that he could put But all his valuables into it. Baseball cards and a watch and some money. When you have other little brothers, you got to keep your stuff protected. Gotta keep it safe. But one of the interesting features about this lockbox was that it was fireproof. And I remember my dad explaining to us what that meant. He said that if you put something in here and the house were to burn down, whatever was inside that box would be safe. Now, thankfully, we never tested that out, or verified its usefulness. But it protected it, it kept it from being harmed. Do you realize that your eternal salvation is something that cannot be touched or tampered with in this world. And it gives us courage because even if we lose everything in our life, we hold to the unchangeable truth. We put our trust in Him, knowing that one day ultimately he's going to save our souls. First Peter, chapter one and verse three says, blessed to be the God and Father of our Lord, Jesus Christ, according to His great mercy He has caused us to be born again to a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, to an inheritance that is imperishable, undefiled and unfading kept in heaven for you. Do you see the terms that he's using there it is, imperishable, undefiled and unfading, something that cannot tarnish or be affected by this world because he lives we have been born again, to a living hope. Because he has been raised, we have the same hope of one beat one day being raised with Him. And that's something that no one can take from us. The fear of death is gone. Because he lives he holds the future. You ever think about the future? What's going to happen? Down the road years from now?

Conrad Harkrider  22:21
anxiety and worry can often paralyze us as we think about where my life is going, where my life is going or where it's headed. And we can be consumed with the questions of how's this going to work out is everything going to be okay? But notice what Jesus told the people in the in the Sermon on the Mount in Matthew chapter six and verse 25. He says, Therefore, I tell you to not be anxious about your life, what you will eat, or what you will drink or about your body, what you will put on, Is not life more than food in the body more than clothing? Look at the birds of the air, They neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them, are you not of more value than they are? In which of you by being anxious can add a single hour to his span of life? Jesus uses the illustration he says, I want you to look at the birds of the air, they don't store up food. They don't plant they don't save away in barns, and yet your heavenly Father, He feeds them. And the point is, if God takes care of even the most insignificant creatures, how much more those who have been created in his very image, how much more than people who have devoted and committed their lives to serving Him, will he not take care of us. He knows our needs, and he has promised to never leave him to never leave us. Early in his life, Joseph suffered a tremendous amount of hardship. If you remember he was hated by his brothers, and that led to him being thrown in to a pit being sold off into slavery, being a captive in another man's house being treated unjustly. And finally he ends up in prison. He has no future no prospects, no potential for a family or a career or anything. He was stuck in an Egyptian jail cell, hundreds of miles away from his family. His father thought he was dead. But at the end of his life, Jacob gives a blessing to each of his sons and notice what he says about Joseph in Genesis 49 And verse 22. He says Joseph is a fruitful vine, a fruitful vine near a spring, whose branches climb over a wall with bitter with bitterness. Archers attacked him they shot at him with hostility. But his bow remained steady his strong arms stayed limber, because of the hand of the Mighty One of Jacob because of the shepherd, the rock of Israel. Notice his situation it says that it was as if archers were attacking him. They were coming at him with bitterness and hostility. He had everything working against him. But it says that his bow remained steady, his arms stayed limber, they stayed strong. And sure, it's a picture of a warrior who's in the midst of a great battle. The arrows are flying at him, and yet his hands do not shake, they don't quiver. His arms continue to have strings. And how is his strength not diminish? How is this possible? It says, because of the Mighty One of Jacob, the shepherd, the rock of Israel. Often we pray for relief, we ask God to take us out of a situation. But so often the answer to our prayer is not to be removed from the difficulty. But instead he provides steady hands. He gives strong arms, so that even in the midst of the great battle, we can remain faithful. This is the promise that we hold to that God holds the future. And so no matter what happens in this life, he controls our destiny. He is a God of the past, the present and the future. And despite how hopeless the situation may seem, or may look, God is still in control. And we know that he works all things together for good to those who love Him, and to those who are called according to His purpose Romans 828. Finally, because he lives, life is worth living. Because he lives life is worth living.

Conrad Harkrider  27:11
This actually goes against how the world thinks many people in the world think that because they have lots of money than life is worth living, because they are successful, because they are respected because they have made it their life is worth living. But as the writer of Ecclesiastes points out, after he has pursued wealth and pleasure and wisdom, after going through all of those things, he says Vanity of vanities, it's just like chasing after, like grabbing for the wind, it's emptiness. Sometimes our life doesn't feel like it's worth living. It feels monotonous. We get up, we eat breakfast, we sit in traffic, we go to work, we sit in traffic again, come home, help with the kids, and then go to sleep. The next day, we do it all over again. We kind of get in this hamster wheel. And we start to think what is the point of all this? Do we have a purpose. But our purpose and meaning doesn't come from the things that we do from eight to five. We have something that is deeper than our external circumstances. In John eight, in verse 12, again, Jesus spoke to them saying, I am the light of the world, Whoever follows me will not walk in darkness, but we'll have the light of life. Our life is worth living because it's full of light. Because we have purpose, significance, we have hope and blessing. We understand who we are. And that's what God wants for his children. He doesn't want us to just be going through this life as a chore as a drudgery. But we are to live as people with hope with Thanksgiving with joy in our hearts. And when we have that joy, we see examples from the scriptures. It's why Peter and the other apostles after being arrested and beaten, they could give thanks and praise to God. It's why Paul and Silas could offer up songs of praise and thanksgiving while in the prison. Life is worth living because he lives because of what it means to us. The final verse of the song says that one day we'll cross that river will fight life's final war with pain and then his death gives way to victory will See the lights of glory. And we'll know he rains. You ever think about heaven? Sometimes we spent a lot of time thinking about our next vacation, retirement, a new car. But do you ever stopped to really think about heaven, the eternal glory that is going to be given to those who have been faithful to the Lord, to stand in the presence of an eternal God? One of the kids asked me recently, she said, Are we going to have clothes up in heaven? I said, I think we're going to be wearing white robes. She said, Well, what about shoes? I said, there are some things that we'll just have to wait and see what they're like. But Heaven is going to be a place that is so glorious, as Paul says, all of the pain and the difficulties that we've been through in this life will seem as nothing. No more sickness, no more doctors, no more struggles, and imperfections. This is the hope that we have because he lives one day, we can be with Him forever. If you're not one of God's children, we want to encourage you to think about that seriously. And to think about your position, and where you stand. The hope that we have in this life comes from the relationship that we have with Jesus Christ. And if you're not walking with him tonight, we want to encourage you to make that step. We're going to close with a song and if there's something that we can do to help you in your walk, please come down to the front as we stand and sing
