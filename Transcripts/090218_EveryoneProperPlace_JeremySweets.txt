Good morning. Certainly good to see everyone here today, it's a good day to be able to worship God and partake of the Lord's Supper and remember the sacrifice of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ. If you're here with us while you are here with us, it's good to see, I'm glad you're here with us. We're going to be studying from God's word at this time. So I appreciate all the songs that Jim led the last one pointing us to God's word, which is what we're going to be doing now opening up God's word. And you sing about exalting Christ. And that's certainly what we want to do here this morning. So appreciate the songs that were led. I have an interest in organization. I think, in part because I feel disorganized a lot of the time, I don't know if you feel that way, especially at home, things like there's always too much stuff. And there's really just a few rules. I've read some books on this, you know, hundreds of pages of books, and it comes down to a couple of simple things. eliminate as much as you can. So I need to work on that still. And the second one is put everything in its proper place. In fact, we lose things when we don't know the place that it has. And so I'd like to talk for just a few moments this morning about putting everyone in their proper place. We have as a theme this year, faithful stewards, faithful stewards. And one of the main texts or passages that we've been using for that is first Corinthians chapter four verses one and two. And I was part of our Bible reading this morning, as we read the extended context of that, First Corinthians four, one and two says, This is how one should regard us as servants of Christ and stewards of the mystery of God. Moreover, it is required of stewards that they be found faithful. Paul says, This is what I want you to think of me. This is how I want you to consider me in such a powerful passage. What I'd like to do this morning is consider the broader context. What made Paul say this, why did he make this statement? Well, I believe he made the statement because there were some that were putting people out of place. And so we want to talk about putting everyone in their proper place this morning. There was a problem that Korea, and that is that they were misplacing others. Now when I say misplacing, often we're talking about losing something, right? If your wallet has a place, that you always put it and it's not there, it may be lost, you have misplaced your wallet, it's not in its proper place. Well, the Corinthians were not losing people, but they were not putting people in their proper place either. In fact, they had a problem and this problem had led to divisions. Notice if you would in First Corinthians chapter one, and verses 10 through 17. First Corinthians one, verses 10, through 17.

Jeremy Sweets  03:20
I appeal to you brothers, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that all of you agree and that there'll be no divisions among you, but that you'd be united in the same mind and the same judgment for has been reported to me by Chloe's people that there is quarreling among you, my brothers. What I mean is that each one of you says, I follow Paul or I follow Paulus, or I follow Sisyphus, or I follow Christ. Is Christ divided? Was Paul crucified for you? Or were you baptized in the name of Paul, I think God that I baptized, none of you except for Christmas and gays, so that no one may say that you were baptized in my name, I did baptize also the household of Stephanus. Beyond that, I do not know whether I baptized anyone else. For Christ did not send me to baptize, but to preach the gospel, and not with words of eloquent wisdom, less the cross of Christ be emptied of its power. Notice that at Corinth, they had misplaced people they had put them in the wrong place. Christ deserves an elevated place as our true lord and master but they had elevated others and put them in a place where they did not belong. And that was a problem that led to many divisions. And it led to a lot of factions. Koreans had many problems and many of those probably were not being addressed because of this problem, because they were divided and following after different people, they had missed place people. And I think we can do the same thing today and we need to be careful of that. Now we say by way of caveat that you Paul is not saying that leaders should not be esteemed. In fact, elsewhere he makes that point. Leaders should be esteemed and held in high esteem. For example, in First Timothy chapter three, when he talks about the overseer the bishop, he says an overseer must be above reproach, Larry is going to use in that same verse and verse two, respectable, respectable. And verse seven, as he talks about those that are to be elders, he says, Moreover, he must be well thought of by outsiders, so that he may not fall into disgrace into a snare of the devil, elders and leaders there are to be held in higher esteem. In fact, that's part of what qualifies them in order to serve as an overseer. We see later in First Thessalonians chapter five, that Paul explicitly states that the leaders are to be held in high esteem. In verses 12 and 13. He says, we ask you, brothers, to respect those who labor among you, and are over you in the Lord and admonish you and to stain them very highly in love because of the work. Leaders here the overseers should be held in high esteem. They're not to be disregarded. But that's not the problem at Corinth. It's not that they were failing to hold them in high esteem, they were holding them in too high esteem. How is that possible? Well, it's possible to hold a leader in too high esteem when you put him on par, on level with Christ. We see in First Corinthians one there were some saying I'm following Paul and a Paulus and Christ, you see Christ was listed among the other leaders. Anytime we would elevate anyone to the place of Christ, we've elevated them to high, Christ reigns supreme. He is above all others, he created all things. He created all things, he is sovereign. And we should not put anyone in his place. But the Corinthians were doing just that they were elevating men, to the place of God. Now, it's really hard for me to imagine people were actually saying this, that it may be the case. Paul may be using this as a device to show their attitude where they might not have been saying this, but they had been elevating people to Ha, I'm not sure the case. But it does indicate a problem that the Corinthians had. There were divisions because they thought too highly of people, and not high enough of God, and Jesus Christ. There's a couple of problems that we see with with this, as Paul mentions is, as I said, they place leaders are on par with Christ, he was listed as one of them. Not only that, but Paul goes to show the foolishness of putting people on par with Christ when he says that people, leaders or anyone else cannot save you. No person, no man has done the work of Christ. Notice how he points this out in verse 13. He says, Is Christ divided? Was Paul crucified for you?

Jeremy Sweets  08:35
There's an obvious no to that question. Paul, St. Paul was not crucified for you. Paul did not die on the cross for you, did he? And even if he did, he could not have offered the sacrifice that Christ did. Christ was sinless. Christ offered himself for the sins of the world. He shed His blood as we remembered as we've protected the Lord's Supper, so that we might have remission of sin. No person could do that. No animal could do that. But Christ alone. So Paul says Paul was not crucified for you. He cannot offer an atoning death for you could. He goes on to say in verse 13, or were you baptized in the name of Paul? And again, the obvious answer is no. You were not baptized in the name of Paul and even if you were that would do you no good is only Christ that offered himself as an atoning sacrifice. So that when we are baptized into the very blood of Jesus Christ, it is His sacrifice that we are baptized into for the remission of our sin. To be baptized into anyone else would really be futile. be futile. And so Paul says you have misplaced people. You need to understand that God, Jesus Christ are first, and that all others are secondary to that all others are creatures that are created by God Almighty. And so Paul says, You have misplaced people, not losing them, but simply not putting them in their proper place. As we move along, we see that Paul says, there really needs to be a proper place. Paul was one of the individuals that people were elevating, he was one alone, Paul Paulus, Sisyphus, and it was almost as if there was a competition. And so Paul says in chapter fours, we get into our text, he says, This is how you should think of me. How many of us would be tempted to say, Yeah, I am great. I've got a following mean, some people that that's what life is about how many followers you have, how many people are noticing you how many people are liking you, how many people are seeing your talents, how many people are seeing what you can do. But Paul says, This is what I want you to think of me. This is what I want you to think of me notice in First Corinthians four in verse one. This is how one should regard us, as servants of Christ, and stewards of the mystery of God.

Jeremy Sweets  11:39
You see, the attitude that Paul has that he exemplifies for us and the attitude that we need to have. In some ways, we're geared in the other direction, aren't we, when it comes to school and schoolwork, we try to do our best we try to perform, we want to be noticed and thought well of the teacher, we want people to think well of us. In our jobs, we have to say in a resume that I can do all these things, we have to look good. It's a competition out there for jobs and look in, in that, when we're working, we want to look good, put our best foot forward. But that can go too far. And that it it takes over our mind. So that that is our only concern, how good we look before other people. Now, yes, be competent at your jobs, do your best in school and all of that. But do not let that get out of control. Understand and realize that what we really are, what we really are as Christians, is servants. We are servants to God. That's not what we want to think of ourselves, as we want to be seen as the leaders, the one that everyone looks to the one that says you're doing everything right, you're in control, you are good, you are great. But Paul says this is what I want you to think about me. I want you to think of me as a servant of Christ. And that is the attitude we need to develop. I want you to think of me as a steward of the Gospel, the mysteries of God. Do you consider yourself a servant of Christ? You know, servants, when I think about servants, servants are fairly well unnamed, for the most part. They're not known. They're not thrown in the positive light. They don't get awards and things like that. Servants are in the background serving. Are we willing to do that for Christ? Are we willing to lower ourselves so that we can be a servant of Christ? Paul says, that's what I need you to think of me they were getting things out of order out of place. He says, but this is where I belong. Would we correct others? If they had us out of place? And say, no, no. This is where I belong. You know, Paul had those that thought he was a god. Thought he was Hermes, the Messenger of the God and they they bow down before Him. What did the apostle say there? Paul says, No stand, stand up, do not bow before me. And Paul has that same attitude here. He says, I'm not the one you need to be worshipping. I'm not the ultimate leader. It is God. We need to develop that mindset about ourselves so much so that we could stop those that are wanting to praise us or put us out of place. And I'm not talking about a word of encouraged MIT but I'm talking about having things out of place. And we should stop that and say, This is what you need to think of us. This is our proper place. Not only servants, but stewards. We've talked a lot about stewards. You remember that stewards are not masters. stewards are not owners. stewards are those that have been entrusted. They've been given charge. Yes, they are working, and they are working diligently, but they are not the masters. They have been entrusted by the master. And that's what Paul says, we are we are not masters. We are not the Lord. But we have been given a work to do a work to do. In first Corinthians chapter nine later in this book, he's going to talk a little bit about that work. I think it's a good application for how we should view our servants in First Corinthians nine verses 16 and 17.

Jeremy Sweets  16:11
He says, For if I preach the gospel, that gives me no ground for boasting. For necessity is laid upon me. Woe to me, if I do not preach the gospel. From if I do this, in my own will I have a reward but if not a my own will, I am still entrusted with a stewardship. Paul says that he is a steward of the gospel. And notice the attitude that comes with that in verse 16. He says, it's one that means that I cannot boast. I'm not saying Look how great I am. But rather, he says in verse 16, it is a necessity laid upon me, or we might think of the word of duty. It is, it is something we are supposed to do. It's not something we boast about, look how great I am. We're not the master, we're not the Lord. But rather we are servants. We are stewards of the master. We see in verse two, it's not enough to be entrusted. Going back to First Corinthians four and verse two, he says, We are not only entrusted as stewards, but were to be faithful. That means it's not enough just to be given the task, but we need to do it faithfully, serving God faithfully, to the best of our ability, being a diligent servant, we need to be servants. That's our proper place, our proper place. Well, notice, he talks about God's proper place next. And it's really when he understands God's proper place that he can put others in their proper place. You know, so many people start with themselves, or they start with civilization and people and you can never get things in their proper place, when that's your starting point. We must start with a knowledge of God and who he is. First Peter five, six, and seven says Humble yourselves, therefore under the mighty hand of God, that must be our starting place, understanding God and His greatness. And it's only when we do that, that we will ever be able to understand who we are, and who other people are and who they should be in His sight. So notice what he says about God's place, and how that affects what he thinks about others, in verse three of First Corinthians four, but with me, it is a very small thing that I should be judged by you or by any human court. In fact, I do not even judge myself, for I'm not aware of anything against myself, but I am thereby not, but I am not thereby acquitted. It is the Lord who judges me. It's that last verse where we are the last sentence of that verse for where he says who God is. It is God who judges me. God is sovereign. God is King. It is God who judges me. God deserves the first place. And Isaiah, it uses this language. It says, For the Lord is our judge. The Lord is our law giver. The Lord is our king. God is the one that is sovereign. He is our judge. And we have to know that if we're going to have the proper attitude toward other people, because he starts with this foundation that God is the judge. Notice what he says about others and how he views others and verse three, he says, but with me it is a very small thing that is should be judged by you or by any human court. No, so often we are consumed with what others think about us. It is the thoughts and opinions of others that controls what we do. Now, we should be concerned with what others think in this regard, if someone has something against us, we certainly need to do everything we can to make that right. We shouldn't seek to be a disrepute in the eyes of other people. Elders, as we mentioned, they are to have a good standing of doing what is right in the sight of other people, that shouldn't be our goal. But what about when we are trying to do what's right, and others still think negatively of us or others are trying to judge us? What controls us? Far too often, it's simply what others think, how they would judge us how they would place us. But Paul says, that's a small thing to him. Why is that a small thing?

Jeremy Sweets  21:10
That's a small thing, because the judgment of any person or human court doesn't have eternal consequences. But the judgment of God does. The judgment of God does. You see how Paul was able to put the judgments or the thoughts of other people in its proper place because of how he understands who God is. That's what we need to do. If we could understand and know and believe that God is our judge, then we won't be enslaved to the thoughts and opinions of others. So that whatever they think we're gonna follow, no, that's not our guide. It is God that is our God. It is the truth of God's word that is our God. And we need to keep that in mind. It is a very small thing, that I should be judged by others. Paul takes that even a step further, in verse three. He says, in fact, I do not even judge myself. I do not even judge myself, for I'm not aware of anything against myself, but I'm not there by acquitted. We're ultimately not even our own judges. It is God's Word that will judge us. It's not simply that I'm happy with myself, or I have a sense of self esteem. I think if you understand who God is, there's a great deal of self esteem you'll have in that or a picture of confidence as being valued people. But again, if you move God out of the equation, and you're happy with yourself, that's not the ultimate goal. That's not what it's all about. But rather, he says, It is God that is the judge. So that shouldn't frighten us. That shouldn't cause us to be filled with terror and fear. But that should cause us to reflect and continually reevaluate, and continually go back to God's word. I'm doing what I know to be right. But let me see if I'm doing it according to God's word. See, God's word is always meant to mold and shape us. It is meant to bend our will according to its way. And we need to be open to that process. Because it is God's word that is the standard. It is God's Word that should be shaping and molding us. So it's not enough simply to say that I feel good, I feel right. That is not enough. And Paul recognizes that. He says, Now I'm not aware of anything. But that's not not the ultimate guide. Just what we think, is not the ultimate god. It is God and what He thinks it is God and what He would have us to do. That's it. That's a difficult task, isn't it? To put people and their judgments in the proper, proper place, to put even my own thoughts and judgments in their proper place and elevate God above all, that we're so often entranced are beholden to the thoughts and opinions of others and even we get consumed with our own selves. So many times. Paul asks a pointed question in Galatians chapter one and verse 10, about our motivation. He says, For where am I now seeking the approval of man, or of God? Or am I tries trying to please men. If I were still trying to please man, I would not be a servant of Christ. And he lays it out very simple. What is our ultimate mode of motivation? Who are we ultimately trying to serve or to please, if it's people, then we're not servants of Christ. It's that simple. If the thoughts and judgments of others, ultimately directs how we act, if all of a sudden society says, Well, this is right, and we begin to follow society, say I don't want to be out of step, I don't want others to look at me in the wrong way. I don't want others to think that I'm backwards. If that's our God, then we're not servants of Christ, we just need to understand that. What is our ultimate motive motivation?

Jeremy Sweets  26:05
Paul says it must be. And it needs to be that we are striving to serve God. We are striving to serve God. God is our judge. Remember how he ends, verse four, or verse five, it is the Lord who judges me. He needs to hold the supreme sway in our lives. God is our judge and should have our devotion and our controlling interest or their controlling interest in our lives. And we should want to please Him above all others. And the reason for that is because God has a proper place, but he will also make a proper placement. God is our judge will one day, make a judgment upon your life? And the question is, are you prepared for that day? Now, I can't tell you the exact day when that will happen. I can't tell you that that will happen when you're 30, when you're 55, seven years old, I can't give you that time. So what is required of us is that we would be prepared at all times because we simply don't know when God will come. So the question is, are you ready right now, for God to make a proper placement in second, or second Timothy four in verse eight, as Paul reflects upon his life and says that the end of my life is near. He says, henceforth are therefore there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous Judge, will award to me on that day, not only to me, but to also all those who have loved as appearing. How does he describe God here? The righteous judge, God will make a proper placement, taking the Word of God as we see in Revelation chapter 20, verse 12, as he opens the books on the final judgment, and placing our life, the deeds which we committed in the body, Second Corinthians five, verse 10, placing those side by side and God will make a righteous judgment, as our lives are held up to the standard of the Word of God. And that sobering picture of the final judgment, that just reinforces that point we've been making all along, that it is God's views, opinions, thoughts, it is God's mind that matters and should matter to us, not other people. On the last day, it will not matter whether we were popular in this life or not. It will man, whether we have lived the godly life, not a perfect life, but one that submits to God and seeks his grace and mercy and all that we have do that humbles ourselves and elevates God, Jesus Christ, and the spirits. God will make a proper placement. So the question I have for you this morning is are you ready for that? Are you prepared? There is no time like right now because you're not guaranteed Another day, another time, make your life right. If you're here this morning, and you're not a Christian, you have an opportunity to answer the invitation of God himself. He sent His Son to die on the cross for you. And you must believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living God must repent of your sins and turn away from a lifestyle of sin and devote yourself to a lifestyle of service to God. You must confess that Jesus is the Christ and be baptized in water for the forgiveness of your sins being raised to walk in newness of life. If you're here this morning and you are a Christian, and you're not living as you should, you also need to make your life right. Make changes, whatever the case is, do what is needed in order to serve God this day so that God can put you with Him in Heaven one day. There's any subject to the invitation please come as we stand and sing at this time.
