It is always such a blessing for us to have an opportunity to come and worship our God, to give him the praise that he deserves. And that's what we intend to do this morning. It's good to have all of you here today appreciate the songs that Trevor LED is we want to bring a lesson that can make a difference hopefully, in your life. And in my life, as well, you know, God calls on each of us to make a difference in the world that we live in. And when Jesus calls us to salt of the earth, in the light of the world, the implication is clear that the world is corrupt. It is engulfed in spiritual darkness and in the grip of sin. So making a difference in the world may seem like a daunting task. It seems like all the rules have changed. The definition of marriage and family have certainly changed. Political Correctness is the buzzword of our culture. But we are Kingdom citizens and kingdom citizens are charged to make a difference in this world. One way that we can do this is by building a spiritual legacy. Now we don't use that word. Often, I think we should. James Dobson, the author of many books on parenting and family, as well as a radio program called Focus on the Family. His written a book, by the title, your legacy, the greatest gift, I haven't read that book yet. But the title was so gripping to me, it caught my attention and gave rise to this lesson. You know, there are a lot of gifts that we can give to our children and those around us. And is a lot of ways that we can make a difference for those that are around us. But the greatest gift I think that we can give our children, as suggested by that title, is by leaving them a spiritual legacy. And so this morning, I want to talk with you about your legacy. And suggest to you that it is in fact, the greatest gift that you can leave this world behind you that there are a lot of ways that we want to impact our children. And our children might be thinking about some money that they might get when parents die, and other things like that. But the greatest gift that I can give my children is to leave them a spiritual legacy that will cause them to serve God all the days of their life, and impact others as well. So this morning, we're going to look briefly at seven Bible characters. That's the perfect number a lot more people we could talk about, we're going to briefly look at seven well known Bible characters, and examine the legacies that they left for each one of us. But the penetrating question I think each of us needs to be thinking about is this question and this is for men and for women, for old and for young? What kind of legacy? Am I going to leave my children? And my brethren? What kind of legacy Are you building today? And so as we think about that, that title this morning, I want you to be thinking about some applications to your own life. So first of all, when we talk about legacy, we raised the question, what is the legacy sometimes political figures come to mind like Ronald Reagan may have some strengths and no doubt weaknesses? Might go back further in history to Abraham Lincoln, he certainly left the legacy in a lot of ways. Some of you familiar with this name, maybe not the face, CS Lewis, who has written a lot in terms of Christian apologetics, a British writer and teacher at Oxford. So we raised the question, what is a legacy, because we don't really talk about that very much. And so quickly, I want to just suggest to you, a legacy is something that you hand down from one generation to the next. And that's what we need to be thinking about.

Mike Roy  03:55
What we're going to leave for our children, our brethren behind us. And I want to suggest to the legacy is a lasting moral or spiritual influence that will impact future future generations for years to come. So as we think about legacy, very often we think about people that are that have transcended their time to generation. And we may never achieve that level of legacy, but we can all develop a legacy in our own lives. One point I want to make at the start of the lesson, is to understand that we need to remember that you don't have to be perfect to build a legacy. And none of the Bible characters that we'll talk about this morning were perfect, but they all established significant legacies in their lives. And so that's what we're talking about. And I think that's why that title got me and really got my attention, your legacy. It's the greatest gift greater than anything else that you do. Your legacy will outlive you may outlive your children. And, and this idea is seen in scripture in Psalms chapter 78.

Mike Roy  05:06
Is God is reminding us of the importance of his law. And that thing is David reveals this part of this. This message and verse five says that he established a testimony and Jacob and appointed a law in Israel, which he commanded our fathers to teach to their children, that the next generation might know them, that children yet unborn, and arise and tell them to their children, so that they should not so that they should set their hope in God and not forget the works of God, but keep His commandments, and that they should not be like their fathers a stubborn and rebellious generation, a generation whose heart was not steadfast who spirit was not faithful to God. This passage illustrates the importance of building legacy and faithfulness in a generation that is passed on to others. And when that doesn't happen, the consequences are catastrophic. If we don't establish spiritual faithfulness and legacy, it can have far reaching consequences in our children's lives, our grandchildren's lives and many other people. On the other hand, if we do establish that legacy, then the benefits can be quite positive and long lasting. And I think we need to realize that, that we all have the ability to establish a legacy. So in Revelation chapter 14, God is showing us a picture of those who had passed from this life they had served God faithfully. And in this passage, John is revealing to us the impact that these dead Christians were still having on those around them. It's and I heard a voice from heaven saying, right, this blessing of the dead who die in the Lord from now on. Blessed indeed says the Spirit, that they may rest from their labors, for their deeds follow them. These were Christians, I say ordinary Christians in some ways. But these people no doubt in the first century of the intense persecution of the Roman Empire, they gave the ultimate sacrifice. They died in service to God standing up for the gospel of Jesus Christ. But part of the what follows from their death is that they rest from their labors. But he said that their deeds follow them, our deeds will follow our lives, our actions will follow us, our legacy will and our influence will follow our lives. Also, in Hebrews chapter 11, verses four and five, Hebrews, chapter 11, deals with some of the great Bible characters of faith in the Old Testament and just mentioned in verse four, that By faith, Abel offered the God a more acceptable, acceptable sacrifice than Cain, through which he was commended as righteous God commending him by accepting his gifts. And through his faith, though he died, he still speaks. Abel still speaks to you and me today, because Abel decided that he was going to give his god give God his best in worship, and serve Him and acceptably. Cain did not do that. They both left legacies. But Abel still speaks to us today. Because he determined that he was going to give God his very best in worship. And so we recognize then the, that our our influence will follow us long after our lives of past couple of Boston, think about before we get into looking quickly at these individuals. Everyone can build a legacy. And I think everyone will build the legacy. It's not something that just is reserved for a select few. All of us can build the legacy, old and young, male and female, all of us can do that. In fact, we are, we will build a legacy. And secondly, I want to suggest that we build our legacy, by what we're doing right now, by being in worship. As best as parents, as single people, we make the priority to come and worship God to study his word, then we are establishing principles for our children and those all around us. So we build our legacy by what we're doing today, what by what we're doing right now. So just think about those thoughts. And let's look again very quickly, at some of the well known Bible characters, I've just selected a handful of them. We're going to look at those somewhat quickly. But let's talk about Noah, Noah established so I believe a legacy. And and I think ultimately, what I see in no way in addition to his faith, and all that was a man who's going to be obedient to God, and do God's word. So the it says in verse nine that these are the generations from Noah. Noah was a righteous man. He was blameless in his generation.

Mike Roy  09:53
And Noah walked with God. Wow, what a compelling example the whole world and Noah's day was in the grip of sin. No one else feared God except Noah, his wife did maybe with his influence his children, that the sons were able to bring three wives into the ark as well, but it was Noah's example. But it's a reminder that you can serve God faithfully, even if the whole world is lost in sin. You don't have to run after the crowd to do evil. Noah was alone. His children were alone. But he was a man determined to do God, and we can be faithful to God, even if the world is not faithful to Him. And think about this, that God gave no with a charge to build this enormous Ark. And to gather two of every animals into the ark, it was a daunting task, to gather all these animals, and to bring them into the ark, they stayed there about six months had to feed them and clean out their waste. Make a lot of people wonder, God, what what do you have in mind for me doing this, but you notice in the text, and this is just looking at a brief clip of that in Genesis chapter six, again, do you see the charts to take two of every kind into the ark, keep them alive. Take in verse 21. As for you take yourself some sum of all the food which is edible and gathered to yourself, and it shall be food for you and for them. Look at verse 22. Thus, no wood did, according to all that God had commanded him. So he did, in spite of all the great things of know that we can pop on his faith and all of that Noah, left a legacy of obedience. In our culture, obedience is not in the top 10 list of words to talk about today. And our religious culture doesn't really matter how you served God, just be sincere and honest. That's not what we find in Scripture. So no, left us an example of what it means to serve God faithfully, and I think, no work and a lot of ways his his legacy was a legacy of obedience. And so that's, and if you don't achieve a name and status in this world, or even in the Lord's church, it doesn't matter. But if you're, if you're obedient to God, and your children see that, then you in fact, have established a noteworthy legacy for your children to follow. So when I think about Noah, he left a legacy of obedience. What an example for us to follow it but Abraham gave, we're looking just briefly at some of these well known Bible characters, and James chapter two. And verses 21, through 23 says Was not Abraham our father justified by works when he offered up his son Isaac on the altar, you see that faith was active along with his works and faith was completed by his works. And the scripture was fulfilled that says, Abraham believed God, and it was counted to him as righteousness. And he was called a friend of God. Wow. Why was Abraham called the friend of God or a friend of God? Because he believed the promises that God had made him. Look at this passage. I've got these all on the screen. But I want you to look at Romans chapter four with me for just a moment. And and look at this, this account of Abraham's faith. Actually,

Mike Roy  13:28
I didn't put it up there yet. In Romans chapter four, verse 17, talking about Abraham, just the context of chapter four, is the idea that justification takes place on the basis of faith and that was evidenced by the Old Testament characters and verse 17, says, as it was written, a father of many nations have made you in the presence of him who believed even God who gives life to the dead, and calls into being that which does not exist in hope against hope, he believes, so that he might become a father of many nations. According to that which had been spoken, so shall your descendants be. Without becoming weakened faith, he contemplated his own body now as good as dead. He's 100 years old, since he was about 100 years old, and the deadness of Sarah's womb sheets about 90, yet with respect to the promise of God, he did not waver in unbelief, but grew strong in faith, giving glory to God and being fully assured that what God had promised he was also he was able also to perform. Therefore, it was also credited to him as righteousness. So God makes a promise to Abraham and Sarah 25 years earlier that they're going to have a child and finally when she's 90 years old, pass childbearing, and Abraham is 100. God is going to fulfill that promise, but it mentions that Abraham did not stagger in unbelief. He did not waver and unbelief. But he believed the promise sort of God, and was fully assured that God was able to keep what He had promised. And so, when I think about Abraham, and his legacy, I see a man who manifested unflinching trust in God, when it didn't make sense within seemed reasonable. He believed that God was able to fulfill this promise, and you think about Abraham, all of his life and in after he has to child a promise, God tells him to offer him up. And he is willing to do that, on the basis of faith, but what what sets Abraham apart, I think, in my mind, from so many Bible characters, is that he simply believed the promises of God. Do you? Do you believe God's promises that he'll be with you, no matter where you go, that he'll meet every need that you have. And that when life is over, he'll take us home to be with Him in Heaven. And so when if we manifest that type of attitude, then we can be, it can be said that we are like Abraham. And so when I think about Abraham, a lot of great things because he had his strengths, he had his weaknesses. But Abraham was a man who had this unflinching trust in God, he believed against all odds. And so many times we don't, and we, we, we stagger in our sometimes questions about God. So again, Abraham sets an example, that is worthy of our invitation. What about Moses? He's another one that we need to think about very briefly. A lot of passes, we could talk about Hebrews chapter 11. In verse 24, says it By faith Moses, when he had grown up refused to recall the son of Pharaoh's daughter, choosing rather than to be Miss treated with the people of God and to enjoy the fleeting pleasures of sin. He considered the reproach of Christ greater wealth than the treasures of Egypt, for he was looking to the reward. By faith, he left Egypt not being afraid of the anger of the king, for he endured as seeing him who is invisible. By faith, he kept the Passover and sprinkled the blood, so that the destroyer of the firstborn might not touch him. Again, Moses is a well known figure this familiar passes to us. The Moses is living life in an Egyptian Palace under Pharaoh he has an opportunity of wealth and affluence and ease, he gives it all up for life of difficulty, hardship and mistreatment, so that he could be God's leader effect, in essence. And so you think about Moses, there's no way to, to quickly summarize his legacy. But God gave the nation of Israel the law through Moses, that's why we call it what the law of Moses, the five books of the Old Testament, first five books of the Old Testament, He was a prophet, the prophet who spoke for God, and he delivered the nation of Israel from Egyptian slavery. So in terms of his influence, he was a prophet, a law giver, and a deliverer. But when I think of Moses in summarizing his his greatness in his legacy, Moses left us a legacy of leadership.

Mike Roy  18:20
He left a legacy of leadership, you know that the Lord needs leaders in his church today. The question is, are we willing to step up and be leaders in his church, and make a difference in the world around us make a difference among his own people. But Moses is a great example. And Moses didn't start out so bold and confident, and all that type of thing. And early on, he did not want to be God spokesman did not want to go to Pharaoh, and he was not gifted with the ability to speak and all of that. But Moses overcame those weaknesses, and became a legend. In terms of biblical leadership, spiritual leadership, think about how Moses impacted the nation of Israel and all the people around him. And he still is an example, for us today to follow. So Moses, left us a legacy of leadership. What kind of legacy am I going to leave for my children? What kind of legacy are we going to leave for our children, our brethren? So Moses is noteworthy look in Joshua, chapter 24. This again, very compelling, this has always been one of the most compelling accounts when I think about this is near John, the end of Joshua's life. And, in fact, in chapter, I think, early in this chapter, he's about to die. And he Institute's a covenant. We've been talking about that and encourage class this morning Institute's a covenant and speaks all these conditions he sent in Iraq is bearing witness to what I'm saying here. So now he's going away of all the earth. And notice what notice what the text says over here in verse 29, and following, it says after these things Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of the Lord died being 110 years old, and they buried him in his own inheritance at Timnath Serah, which is in the hill country of Aetherium. North of the mountain of gash. In verse 31, says that Israel served the Lord, all the days of Joshua, one man impacted the faithfulness of an entire nation all the days of his life. Isn't that amazing? That that this was Joshua's influence. Not only was that true, it says that it's you'll serve the Lord all the days of Joshua, and all the days of the elders who outlived Joshua. Wow, what an example, What a legacy. So in terms of terminology, I think Joshua, left a legacy of generational generational leadership, that he his influence, went on to other generations. So think about that, in terms of his faith, his courage, you know, he was named the successor to Moses, while Moses was still alive, he has the daunting task of subduing the, the the nations that they're going to conquer has a lot of great quality but But Joshua was a man, again of tremendous leadership of what we might call generational leadership, his influence impacted other generations. But I had to put Jove I wanted to talk about him this morning briefly. Because there are a lot of lessons we can learn from job. So in Job chapter one verse one said that there was a man in the land of us whose name was Job, and that man was blameless and upright, one who feared God and turned away from evil. So this tech sounds a lot like in the days of Noah, but Joe was extremely blessed in his life, he lost everything. He endured unimaginable suffering and ridicule. But Jobe patiently endure, he remained faithful to God, if you look in the New Testament, and James, chapter five, verses 10 and 11. James says in verse 10, as an example, Brethren of suffering and patience, take the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord, we count those blessed to endured, he said, You have heard of the patience or the endurance of Joe. So this was, in fact, in my opinion, my understanding Job's legacy, job left the legacy of patience or steadfast endurance, you can look at that word and translate it a little bit differently. But that was his legacy.

Mike Roy  22:46
That job was dealing with unimaginable suffering, ridicule, all types of difficulty with a loss of his entire family. He didn't give up, he didn't quit. And so as we struggle with pain and suffering and anguish or loneliness, whatever it might be, we look to job and really, the account of job is is written down for us, so that I can learn to patiently endure when life gets really, really hard. So job left a staggering legacy. We don't think about it, it doesn't seem glorious or glamorous. But he left a legacy of steadfast endurance. He did not give up and in the end, God does vindicate him. So Job was a man of tremendous patience. Let's look at a couple other examples this morning. We certainly want to talk about David, and in his legacy, and again, we can look at a lot of different passages. I've just chosen one from Acts chapter 13, as Paul is recounting some of Israel's history on his first missionary journey, and jumping into verse 20, says All this took about 450 years. And after that, he gave them judges until Samuel the prophet. Then they asked for a king and God gave them saw the son of Kish, a man of the tribe of Benjamin for 40 years. And when he had removed him, he raised up David to be their king, of whom he testified and said, I have found in David, the son of Jesse, a man after my heart, a man after my own heart. We can talk about David's failures in just a minute. But God found in David was a man whose heart was like God's hunger to do what was right. He thirsted after God's law. So he said, God is sing about David I have found in David the son of Jesse, a man with my heart who will do all my will of this man's offspring. God has brought to Israel a savior Jesus as He promised. So you think about David think about young David. With the courage he manifested in his battle with Goliath he wasn't afraid to face To Goliath, he took the Goliath down. He was one of the greatest warriors in Israel's history, powerful warrior, a great king, maybe one of Israel's the greatest king, because he was guilty of some serious sins, adultery, murder, and no doubt others as well. But he humbly repented of his sin. He wrote many of the Psalms, which reveals his hunger and this delight in God's word. And again, it's reminder to each of us if you don't have to be perfect. me say that, again. You don't have to be perfect to develop a legacy. But David did develop a legacy. And I think his legacy was he was a man who hungered, after God's word, what's most important in your life or in my life? I think that's, that's a remarkable thing to think about in the statement that God makes about David, I have found a man after my own heart. That's a legacy that he left for each of us to imitate.

Mike Roy  26:01
Let's look at one other example this morning, before we extend the invitation. Certainly want to talk about the apostle Paul, as a man of great faith, there's so many examples we could talk about, and I just didn't have time to go through all those this morning. But the Apostle Paul was also a man who left a tremendous legacy for us today. And so this in first Corinthians chapter nine, Paul is talking about his desire to save souls. In verse 19. He says, For though I am free from all that I have made myself a servant to all, that I might win more of them, to the Jews, I became as a Jew in order to win Jews. To those under the law, I became his one under the law, though not being myself under the law, that I might win those under the law. To those outside the law, I became one outside the law, not being outside the law of God, but under the law of Christ, that I might win those outside the law, verse 22, to the week I became weak, that I might win the weak, I have become all things to all people that by all means I might save some, I do at all for the sake of the gospel, that I'm a share with them in his blessings. So Paul is a man. In terms of his legacy, he was a tireless soul winner, a tireless preacher of the gospel of Jesus Christ, he wrote at least 13 books of the New Testament, as a lot of writing, he too endured an unimaginable persecution, suffering in hardship, he traveled extensively through the Roman Empire to spread the Gospel. And yet he did it all with joy, the joy of saving souls. And really, Paul is a tremendous role model and leaves a legacy. For every gospel preacher. Today, anyone who proclaims the gospel of Christ looks for the apostle Paul, his legacy still lives. And none of us come close in any way we're so far off the mark. But he's the example for me. He's example for all of us. His love for the Lord, his zeal for lost souls motivates and inspires all of us to follow his example. So Paul, among other things, left a legacy of a tireless servant who was on a mission to save souls, and we can certainly look to Him for our example. Let me just review some things before we extend an invitation this morning. So when we talk about some biblical legacies, Noah is a man who demonstrated complete obedience to God's word, no excuses he did exactly. And specifically, what God told him to do. That's what the text says, Abraham, man of tremendous faith, with an unflinching trust in God. He's called the friend of God because of his faith in God. And again, what the phrase I think, that we need to tie in with Abraham, is that he heard the promises of God and believed them, and did not doubt God's promises. That's why he has left a legacy for us. Moses is a prophet, he's a law giver, he is a deliverer. But Moses left us a legacy of leadership. And his example still, is, is being felt in our lives today, Joshua, again, I use this phrase generational leadership. He was a man who, maybe in some ways, single handedly caused the nation of Israel to be faithful to God as long as he lived. And when he was buried, as long as the elders were still alive, that served him. Israel was faithful to God. It's remarkable leadership, generational leadership. Are we generational leaders making a difference for those to come? I'm hoping that we our job is a man who left a legacy of perfect patience. When almost anybody else might give up and quit, job continued to persevere. He was a man of steadfast endurance. That's a noteworthy quality. And maybe it's not as glamorous in some ways as some other quality. But Job left a legacy of patience. He did not give up. David again, he was a man after God's own heart had tremendous strengths. He had his weaknesses. But he had he had a heart, for God's word, a heart to do God's will. And then the apostle Paul,

Mike Roy  30:42
excuse me. He was a tireless preacher of the gospel, he was willing to spend and be spent, he spent his life serving God and saving souls and finally died. During the very thing. He loved saving souls, remarkable examples to think about these individuals. But the question that each of us have to think about now, and as long as we have life and breath in us is this question. What kind of legacy are you you're going to leave those around you what kind of legacy you're gonna leave your children? Yeah. And that's something that we have to be reminded of is that we build our legacy today. And while we're alive, and I want to suggest to you and we could have used Jesus as another example, and I'll just use it in the clothes. But the best place to start if you want to build a legacy that will last follow the example of Jesus Christ, he left quite a legacy obviously, he left a legacy of love, compassion, mercy, truth, complete selflessness and obedience to God. And when I think about Jesus, one thing stands out, I guess maybe from the Garden of Gethsemane. As a man, he totally surrendered to the will of his Father. He pushed aside comfort. He pushed aside his own prerogatives, his own wishes, and he totally fell on his face before the ground and surrendered to His Father's will. What an example, What a legacy if you want to build legacy in your life, and we all do. Let's start with that attitude. If you're not a Christian, the first thing to do I know you hear about, you know, hear the gospel and repent and believe, and be baptized, all that but the first thing you got to do is surrender. I give up, I'm not going my way any longer, give up completely surrendered to God's Word, His will and then yield your life and complete obedience to Him. It may be that you need the prayers of the congregation were here always to assist and encourage each of us as we journey towards heaven if you need to respond to the gospel in any way come while we stand and sing this song
