It is always such a pleasure for us to assemble and worship and praise our God in heaven. That's why he made us and, and it's so encouraging is we have entered into that period of worship this morning completing some Bible classes this morning. And in that process, learning more of God's will. That's what this is all about as we come to worship God and sing praises to his great name, and to offer prayers that we've done this morning, appreciate chances, pray this morning to chance to gather around the Lord's table. We do this, to glorify God to honor God as we seek seek to become more like Him. And in through this whole process, I want to suggest to us that God made us in such a way that he wants to fill us. And I'm remember, as a young kid, you've probably heard phrases like this, but I think my mother would say, occasionally, Oh, Michael, you're just full of baloney. And he would ever say that to you, not the only one. There's full of baloney. What does that mean? You're full of nonsense silliness, maybe other phrases, but the reality is that we are full of something. And we live in a culture that fills us with all types of thoughts, sometimes good, bad, very ugly. And I want to suggest to each of us this morning that we were actually made by God to be filled. The question is, what are we going to be filled with? So let's look at that this morning. Again, I want to suggest that God designed us and made us in such a way that we would partake of His character, but but we would actually be filled up with any number of things. And he would want us to be filled up with truth with wholeness with purity with righteousness and all of that. And so when we think about the fact that God made us with five senses, the sense of taste, the sense of smell, sight, hearing, and touch, so we're constantly being filled with with something I was actually part of this lesson came about when I was in Gallatin a few weeks ago, and as obviously stopped the lunch on a regular basis and going into a KFC up there. That was the KFC in Gallatin, by the way is all you can eat, kind of a buffet, someplace, you go in order what you want. But as I just notice, all these people eating, you know, over it, and I was eating too. And this is a regular thing, I don't eat just once a week, if you don't eat us, once every month, we do this on a regular basis, we constantly fill ourselves with food. So taste is a big part of that smell. You know, you we, God has given us this ability to smell aromas. One thing that comes to my mind driving down Main Street in Hendersonville, they drive past Burger King, they, they pump, that charbroiled burger smell into the air, and it goes all over the city. And even if you're not hungry, like pet smells good, I'm gonna go get some of that stuff, even if you don't like burgers, or whatever. So this tastes, the sense of smell sight. We're constantly taking in things I mean, constantly, every day, all day. Images, we see people television, movies, music, all that all that type of thing. Well, you don't see music, but you might read music. But anyway, we're constantly taking in images constantly hearing. And again, we're we're listening to messages, listen to music. This morning, we've been filled with our Baba class from the book of Luke and Acts as we see those things connected together. So and now, we're in the process of being filled with some message from God as I plan to preach this morning. Touch is another way, another one of our senses. It's interesting that in the scriptures, Jesus, us touching the very meaningful way he touched the leper. Nobody would ever do that. He healed people and touch them that were considered outcasts. So the point I make here is that by design, by God's design, we were made to be filled. And so the question that we have to ask ourselves as we get into this lesson, what are you filled with? What am I full of? And here's just some things to think about. We talked about taste and all the five senses. Junk Food is a common thing and you know, in preaching, you have to be somewhat honest, you know, and, and I do try to eat healthy and I do try to exercise but at some times, I have to confess that I am a junk food junkie.

Mike Roy  04:39
That's not fun to admit that. But sometimes we that may be true of a lot of us we eat bad things. We eat unwholesome foods, sugary, drinks poor that's one of my weaknesses. Fatty for some This, again, making us think about the fact that we were made to be filled. What are we filling ourselves with? Well, what if we fill ourselves with violent movies? That's not healthy. We become angry people. And we live in a sports dominated world. We love the football and everything else. I

Mike Roy  05:13
certainly do and go to those games. But a lot of these sports are very violent. And sometimes if you go or if you're with a friend, they say, hit him again, you know, or I hope he breaks his neck. Really. This is a game you're supposed to win by points, not by torture and and, and cracked vertebrae and all that kind of stuff. So what are we filled with? Sometimes we were filled with anger because of a lot of different factors. What if we're watching suggestive television where people kind of undress on the silver screen, and our minds are full of all this type of suggestive activities? And, and well, what happens when when that we are fed that type of a diet are often full of lustful thinking. And keeping lustful thinking out of my mind is a constant battle is a constant battle for all of us, I believe. So again, the question What are you filled with? Are you filled with lustful thoughts? angry thoughts? What about lies? We live in a culture where this is really glorified almost men, I'm not a big fan of television or movies. But very many TV programs and movies have themes where lying is a predominant part of that. In fact, I remember years ago, I didn't see this movie. But Jim, Jim Carrey has started it is called Liar Liar. And if I'm not mistaken, I think that this whole movie glorified this man's constant practice of lying. And so when we hear that kind of things, we can deceive ourselves. And so sometimes we're filled with self deception. We don't tell ourselves the truth, as we should. So again, I'm just trying to probe your mind to think about what's in your heart, what's in your mind, what are you filling yourself with? What about false teaching? It's not politically correct to talk about that. But the reality is, if you listen to so many, the modern day pastors, the priests, and certainly the Pope, they're not teaching the truth on very many issues, how a person is saved. In scriptures, a person has to be born again. In our religious culture, most of these, many of these pastors are teaching people to save the sinners pray, that's not true. That's not how you get forgiveness of your sins. So there's all types of things. So there's junk foods, junk thoughts, on wholesome foods, and wholesome thoughts watered down true. What if our minds are filled with if we were filled with jealousy, or envy, to we wish that we had what somebody else has? We filled with worldliness or selfishness and the list goes on and on. But I'm suggesting to us to think about this morning. What do you feel you are made to be filled? That's by God's design, what are you filled with? And I want to suggest that Jesus kind of answer this for us and where these thoughts come from, and Matthew chapter 15, verses 15 through 2015, through 20. Peter said, Tim explained the parable to us. And he said, Are you also still without understanding? Do you not see that whatever goes into the mouth passes into the stomach, and it's and is expelled, but what comes out of the mouth proceeds from the heart, and this defiles a person, he says, four, out of the heart, come evil thoughts, murder, adultery, sexual immorality, theft, false witness, slander, he said, these are what defile a person. So Jesus tells us that what comes out of our minds, what comes out of our heart, or comes out of our mouth proceeds from the heart. So the reality is we continually are filling our minds, our hearts with something, we got to be very careful about that and understanding that what we end up talking about and what type of activities that we may engage in is a result of what we allow to fill our hearts and minds. And so we're talking this morning about the fact that we were made to be filled. I want to suggest, more specifically this morning, and this is kind of the theme of my lesson, that we were made to be filled with God himself, that he wants us to partake of His character, His holiness, His purity, His righteousness, to become that type, the type of person that would imitate God in our lives. And so think about that with me. And this is a passage actually, we read, Gil read in the concerning the Lord's Supper in the scripture that Jim made reference to in the song selection. But again, here's this is a well known passage of scripture I want us to think about here for just a moment. And Paul is praying for these Christians at Ephesus, this is Paul's prayer for the Ephesians and and by extension, his prayer for us as well. And he said For this reason I buy my knees before the Father from whom every family in heaven and on earth is named, that according to the riches of his glory, he may grant you to be strengthened with power through his Spirit in your inner being. so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith, and that you being rooted and grounded in love, may have strength to comprehend with all the saints, what is the breadth, and length and height and depth. And he says, to know the love of Christ that surpasses knowledge, and I'm not going to be just camped out in this passage, we'll be looking at some applications here a minute. But one of the things that Paul wants us to know and you'll mentioned this during the Lord separate talk, is to know how much God loves you. And you can spend a lifetime doing that and and still not fully understand and grasp, grasp the magnitude of God's love for you. Sometimes you say, I'm not worthy, I'm imperfect and flawed, and that's not the point. God loves us in spite of those things. And is this is kind of a paradox over here. He said, He wants these Christians to know the love of Christ, in and of all the things that you need to know about in your life, knowing how much Jesus Christ loves you is at the top of the list. And then it's this paradoxical statement, he says, to know the love of Christ that surpasses knowledge. What does that mean?

Mike Roy  11:22
It means really, it's hard for us to, to get our get our mind around that, that we can contemplate that and think about that, and still not fully understand why Jesus loves me, and why he loves you. You can spend your whole life thinking about that and still not understand. Why did Jesus go to the cross, and suffer horrific torture and pain and ultimately, death for me, a sinner, condemned unclean. One of our songs says that, so this is this is the challenge for us. And and Lord's supper brings those thoughts to our mind to know the love of Christ that surpasses knowledge, and then what's the result of that, that you may be filled with all the fullness of God. So that's the goal. That's kind of the theme of the punchline of my lesson. We were made to be filled with God, not all this other junk that we talked about this morning, we were made and designed to be filled with God, himself, his his character, and and the question is, how do we do this? So if you take notes, or if you're making mental notes, put this down, it's a theme for your life, God made me to be filled with him, how am I doing? What am I? What am I being filled with? Or what am I filling myself with? And so, with that in mind, let's ask the question, how do we fill ourselves up the God? So Paul's prayer for the Christians at Ephesus is that they would be filled to all the fullness of God, how do we get full of God? Well, a couple of things to think about. We need to read God's word, I think on a daily basis, we need to meditate on God's Word on a daily basis, we need to pray to God daily. And then we need to worship God on a regular basis, I believe and want to suggest that by doing these things consistently, is how we're filled with God. Sometimes that means turning off the television, turning off the computer, turning, turning off our phone, whatever it might be, and getting alone alone time with God. But I want to suggest to us that this is really the process of how we fill ourselves up with God. So that's really Paul's ultimate prayer, and aim in Ephesians chapter three, to be rooted in the truth that Christ made well in our hearts to faith,

Mike Roy  14:01
but ultimately, to know the love of God, and how that can impact the lives so ultimately, that we are filled up with God. So the first thought to think about thinness. If we're going to fill ourselves up with God, we need to read God's word on a daily basis, so many passes we could look at, but here's one. In Acts chapter 17, said that the brothers immediately sent Paul and Silas away by night to Berea, and when they arrived, they went into the Jewish synagogue. Now these Jews were more more noble than those in Thessalonica. They received the word with all eagerness. So think about this, that these Jews were more noble than those in Thessalonica. They received the word with all eagerness, examining the Scriptures daily. So again, think about this. Paul goes to Thessalonica goes into synagogue, he's trying to preach and doesn't have much, much success, in fact, because of his message of faith in Jesus Christ and repentance and all that They chased him out of town, chased him out of town. We'll be staying down the book of Acts. And then as he goes on to Berea, they follow him over there. So the contrast is made that in the synagogue in Berea, Visa, Visa, Jews, these are not Christians. These are Jews. And they hear Paul's preaching. They received it with all eagerness. They examined the scriptures daily to see if these things were so that goes along with Luke's account that we've been talking about this morning, to verify the accuracy and of the beginnings of Christianity. The spread of the gospel is interesting in verse 12, he said, many of them, therefore believed, not with a few Greek women of high standing as well as men. So what what we see here is, and this is just one script, that is something that we can talk about, but God is showing us the importance of studying God's Word on a daily basis. And the question is, as we seek to be filled with God, are you trying to read God's word? Every day? It's a struggle in we're honest, we all fall short in our Bible reading plans that we might be on. But one of the ways that I can be more full of God, and less of myself, by reading His word every day, it changes me, it transforms me. And it changes and transforms each one of us. So the first thing I want to suggest to us then that one of the ways that we can be filled with God is to read His word every day. Secondly, and mentioned that we need to meditate on God's Word on a daily basis. Excuse me. Notice the well known psalm, Psalm chapter one and verses one through three. The psalmist says, Blessed is the man who walks not in the counsel of the wicked, nor stands in the path of the sinners, nor sits in the seat of the scoffer. So he's talking about the godly man, the God fearing man, the one who is blessed by God is a man who does not walk in the Council of wicked people. He doesn't stand out in a way with sinners, and he doesn't certainly sit down that wishes a progression of maybe ungodliness sit down in the seat of the scoffers. What does he delight in? His delight is in the law of the Lord. What do you delight in? Like I said, some people delight in these movies where lying is glorified, where fornication is glorified, where covetousness is glorified, and greed is glorified. They delight in that. Surely we don't do that. The godly man, the lights in the law of the Lord. There's nothing that can satisfy us as much as meditating on God's word. So the godly man delights in the law of the Lord. And on his law, he meditates

Mike Roy  17:57
day and night, that's the difference. We say, I'm going to read my Bible. That's great. We need to read our Bibles we need to study. But there's a difference between Bible reading and Bible meditation. When you meditate on God, you think you see His power, His grandeur, hit his holiness, and his love and all that. And we meditate on the idea of when this life is over. Serving God faithfully, I'll be given the crown of life, the crown of righteousness. Wow. That gets me excited to share in the glory of God, but to realize also that if we turn away from God and our disobedience, his will to be cast out of his presence forever. God wants us to meditate on His Word, because it's the most important source of truth that we can go to and it changes who we are. So the godly man in Psalm chapter three is he is one who is filling himself up with God. He not only reads God's Word on a daily basis, he meditates on God's word day and night. What's the benefit from this passage? What's the benefit of the lighting and God's word and meditating on God's word lifted from this context? He's said that he is like a tree planted by streams of water, I want to be like a tree, a tree planted by the streams of water really cannot be moved. And so that's one of the benefits there. It says that yields is fruit in his season, and his leaf does not wither and all that he does, he prospers. God's word is for us, is for our benefit. It helps us to become more like Him. And when we meditate on God's word, and constantly think about it, and ponder its meaning and visualize the promises of God, all that type of thing. We are in effect, filling ourselves up with God himself. The third, I will go to the third point in just a moment I came across this quotation Shannon from this fella Claudius Solomos think he lived around the time of Alexander the Great so y'all can do some research find out who this person was. But he said this I have lost a world of time had I one year more it should be spent and per using David's Psalms, and Paul's epistles mind the world less. And God more need to put that in front of our televisions and a lot of other things. God great thought that think about so we recognize then that one of the ways that we fill ourselves up with God is by meditating can there's a difference between meditating on His Word on his greatness. The third way that we can fill ourselves up with God is spending time in prayer. Now this is a passage that we're familiar with. Paul says in First Thessalonians chapter five see that no one repays anyone evil for evil, but always seek to do good to one another and to everyone. Rejoice always pray without ceasing. Give thanks in all circumstances, as we give thanks in all circumstances, we become more like God, we become we become more like Jesus Christ, is it for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you Do not quench the spirit, do not despise prophecies. But test everything hold fast, what is good, abstain from every form of evil. This is a passage that we're so familiar with. We kind of read past that. But again, look at verse 17. He says, Pray with without ceasing. Can we pray without ceasing? Or sometimes like me? Do I go grow weary? I want to pray, and I just can't put forth the energy, the effort to consistently pray like that. He says, Pray without ceasing. God knows your struggles. He knows my struggles. He knows your trials, He knows our difficulties. And the the admonition is for us to pray. So when we spend time, praying without ceasing, guess what happens? That filling up process, we're thinking more and more of God's power and less of my weaknesses, and deficiencies and shortcomings and all that we go through life, I don't think I can do this. I'm not talented enough, I don't have enough faith, that focus is all selfish. When we spend time praying to God and praying without ceasing. Then slowly we allow ourselves to be filled with the power and the love and holiness of an awesome God. So again, that's the third way. I think that we can allow ourselves to be filled with God. And then fourth, I want to suggest is what we're doing this morning. I suggest to you that worship, worship is so important. Look at this passage in John chapter four. And verse 21, through 24, Jesus said to her to the woman, the Samaritan woman at the well, woman believed me the hours coming when neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem, will you worship the Father. You worship what you do not know if we worship what we know for salvation is from the Jews. But the hour is coming and now is when the true worshipers will worship the Father in spirit and a true so let's understand that God doesn't just accept any worship, we want to worship Him.

Mike Roy  23:17
In spirit, and in truth, we don't have to know the truth, but it's a spiritual activity. It's not a physical type of engagement. Then it says, Jesus says, For the Father is seeking such people to worship him. And then he says, God is spirit and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and in truth and what I suggest to us, as we seek to be filled with God, worship is one of the ways that we do that. And we maybe say it often. When we come together and worship God, we clearly understand this is for God, we're seeking to glorify God, He is the object of our praise. We are pointing our fingers to him in our hands him saying you are worthy. That's why we sing the song. So worship is all about God. Right? giving him the praise that he deserves. But through that process, this earthen vessel is changed and filled more of God's character. That's, that's the design of worship. So do you want to fill yourself up with God? Spend time in meaningful worship as we're doing even this morning? You look at the scriptures and you see this emphasis throughout. Look at his passage in Revelation chapter five, this but I think maybe the last verse I'm gonna look at this morning before we review the lesson, Revelation chapter five, John, it needs some encouragement because of the persecution Christians are dying. In the first century, they they're dying, sometimes burned at the stake. I mean, it was horrible. And John needs to know that the Christ cause is going to be is victorious, that Christians will be victorious. So he's given a a little preview of heaven. So John Since I looked like the door is open, I heard around the throne of the living creatures and the elders divorce of many angels numbering, myriads of myriads, and 1000s of 1000s, saying with a loud voice, Worthy is the Lamb who was slain to receive power, and wealth and wisdom and might an honor and glory and blessing. And then look at verse 13. And I heard every creature, every creature in heaven, and on earth, and under the earth, and in the sea, and all that is in them, saying, To him who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb, be blessing and honor and glory and might forever and ever. So John sees his glorious worship seen in heaven, that encourages him and empowers him to continue to serve God faithfully. And then the last verse, the four living creatures said, Amen. And the elders fell down in worship. We're going to worship God forever. That's what we're preparing for right now worshiping God forever, again, because he deserves it. We give him all praise and glory and honor. But through the process of worship, were changed, were transformed. And we're filled, more and more with his holiness in his purity. So we can kick out selfishness as an impurity and all the stuff that tries to creep into our hearts. And so Revelation chapter five, again, shows us that really the final scene there, Christ on the throne, the lamb on a throne, God being worshipped and praised forever. So again, how do we fill ourselves up with God, maybe a lot of different ways. We read His Word on daily basis, we meditate on His Word daily, we pray to God daily, and we worship God on a regular basis. And so I think the question that we have to ask ourselves as we bring the lesson to a close this morning is this question. So what are you filling yourself with, we are made to be filled with the physical app application, the food that we eat, but the thoughts that we allow to get into our minds, what are we filling ourselves with? In our lives? And I think the question would be, are you are you full of yourself? Am I full of myself? Are you full of this world? Or are you full of God? So it's a it's a thought provoking question where we stopped to contemplate the fact that God made us, He made us to be filled. And he wants us to go through that process well

Mike Roy  27:38
was we take this moment to extend the invitation. This morning, I have seen the invitation song. Let's say if there's someone here this morning, who is not a Christian, there's no way that she can be full of God. If you don't obey the gospel of Jesus Christ, you have to come to full obedience and God's will. So in order to become a Christian, according to the Scriptures, you must believe that Jesus is the Christ, you must be willing to repent of your sins, you must confess your faith in Jesus, and you must be baptized and water to have your sins forgiven, because God said, so. If you can google it today and ask about all the well known Protestant evangelical preachers, many of them are not saying that I'm saying they're not telling you the truth. If you want to be filled with God, you have to obey His Word fully. And that involves baptism. And it's reminded that baptism, when it's followed, when it follows faith and repentance and confession, baptism puts us into Christ. Galatians chapter three, verse 27. And in so doing, we are covered with the blood of Christ, talking about being full of God's righteousness, full of His Holiness. And his so doing, we get begin to be filled with God himself. So baptism is meaningful because it's one of the components that's involved in a person being saved from their sense of here this morning, you haven't done that. We would urge you to do that we have a baptistery. Ready here. If you want to study God's word more so that you can fully understand to be assured of what God's will is. We'd be glad to assist for that as well. If there's any this morning that needs to respond to an invitation. We invite you to come while we stand and sing the song
