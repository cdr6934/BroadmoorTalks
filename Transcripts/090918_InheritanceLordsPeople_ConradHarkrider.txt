No matter what's going on out in the world, or what's happening in our own lives personally, what a blessing it is to take time to worship the Lord. It's an encouragement to see each one of you here today. And I'm looking forward to studying another section of God's Word together if you will open up your Bibles to Isaiah chapter 54. Isaiah 54.

Conrad Harkrider  00:48
In 1998, there was this wealthy Portuguese bachelor, who drafted his last will and testament, there were 70 individuals that were named in the document. 13 years later, he passed away of natural causes. And the people who were listed in his will were contacted to let them know that they were going to receive a part of his estate. But the interesting thing was, is that these people were not children. They weren't family members, or even friends of this wealthy man. They were complete strangers. Come to find out he had taken a phonebook a directory, and randomly selected people to leave his inheritance to that, can you imagine that? Getting a phone call or receiving a letter to find out that you were going to receive millions of dollars from a complete stranger. And sometimes we hope and dream for those types of things. We think about a long lost relative who maybe has an unknown amount of wealth and they just decide to bequeath it to us. And we get excited about these an inheritance that we might receive. This morning, we're going to talk about inheritance, but it's something that is much greater in value than fine china or rare jewels or any amount of money that someone can pass down to us. As Isaiah speaks about, the inheritance of the Lord's people. Look at what he says in Isaiah chapter 54 And verse 17, Isaiah 54 and 17. No weapon formed against you shall prosper. And every tongue which rises against you in judgment, you shall condemn. This is the heritage of the servants of the Lord. And their righteousness is from me, says the Lord.

Conrad Harkrider  03:21
A heritage is a property that descends to an heir, something that an heir receives. And Isaiah says that this is what God's people will one day receive. Let's look at this text together. Isaiah 54. One of the most well known passages in all of Scripture is Isaiah 53. We often refer to that, that as the passage of the suffering servant, it describes one who would be despised and rejected by men, a man of sorrows acquainted with grief. And although it was written nearly 700 years before the time of Christ, it describes with great accuracy and detail the oppression and the persecution that God's chosen servant would go through. It is quoted numerous times in the gospels and the New Testament. It's the passage that the Ethiopian eunuch was reading when Philip met him on the desert road. And it is the defining characteristic, the suffering servant of Jesus Christ. You can't have the Christ God's Anointed One without the cross. He is the crucified, Lord. But this morning, I want us to think about what comes as a result of that, that Shafter that follows Isaiah 54 What do God's people receive? Because As of what the suffering servant went through what he gave up, and I see, what I see here is a, a, a gift, an inheritance, a reward that is handed down to the people of the Lord. Notice verse one, Isaiah 54, in verse one, seeing, Oh Baron you who have not born, break forth into singing, and cry aloud, you who have not labored with child, for more are the children of the desolate than the children of the married woman says the Lord. Notice the first word of the passage, he says, to sing, to cry aloud to break forth in to singing in our house, there's lots of noise that goes on with three little girls, there's a good amount of singing, and there's also a good amount of screaming. And both of those are high pitched noises that come out of the mouth. But they have a very different source. Singing comes from a heart of thankfulness of gratitude, of rejoicing. And that's what he says is going to happen with his people, they are going to have cause for great joy. But notice who it is who's offering up this praise. He says that it is the barren those who have not born and first of all we see

Conrad Harkrider  06:31
with the inheritance of the Lord's people there is going to be this blessing given to the Baron. Those who have not had children are going to have cause for great rejoicing. You know, being childless in the ancient world was seen as a as a disgrace. In our culture today, it's people have their careers and in their occupations and their jobs. And so it's not viewed in the same way. But during these times, it was of paramount importance for women, especially to have a family to raise children. That's why when, when Rebecca, finally, or when Rachel rather, finally conceives and gives birth to Joseph and Genesis 30, in verse 23, she says, God has taken away my reproach. This was a sense of security for them, people relied upon their children to take care of them, to provide for them to protect them. And we can see in the book of Ruth, when Naomi is going through a difficult time, she says, Call me, Mara, for the Almighty has dealt very bitterly with me, after losing her husband and her sons, she had nothing to rely on, nothing to fall back on. That's the state of the bear in the one with no children. But here, the Lord says, Those who are bitter and downcast, they're going to have cause for rejoicing. He says that the children of the desolate will be more than the children of the one who's married. How is that possible? How is God going to bring about a great nation from one who who can't even have offspring? This may be referring to Abraham and his two wives. If you remember, God had made that promise to Abraham and Sarah, that they were going to have a son and then through him there was going to be a great nation that would come. And as the promise was delayed, and time went on, Sarah and Abraham tried to intervene. And so they gave Sara's handmade Hagar to him as a wife, and she bore Ishmael. But God comes back to Abraham to remind him, he says, No, the promise will be fulfilled through your wife, Sarah, even though you are 100 and she is 90 years old. This is how he was going to bless them. And God is constantly working in this type of way he reverses the tide. He takes a situation that seems utterly hopeless and causes great blessings to flow from it. Look at verse two. It says, Enlarge the place of your tent and let them stretch out the curtains of your dwellings. Do not, do not spare lengthen your chords and strengthen your stakes, for you shall expand to the right and to the left, and your descendants will inherit the nations and make the desolate cities inhabited. Not only are the barren going to bring forth children, but there is going to be this incredible blessing. They are going to spread out in verse two he uses a metaphor of a tent that just keeps expanding. In verse three, he says that it's going to be from the right and to the left. He says the inheritance of the offspring are going to inherit the nation's they're going to cover the earth. This is the type of reversal that God so often uses. Think of a few examples. A baby that is sitting down at a river, left for dead, will ultimately become the deliverer of God's people, Moses.

Conrad Harkrider  10:25
God is always looking for unlikely circumstances to bring about his purposes. The children of Israel were slaves in the land of Egypt, serving under a hard bondage, and yet God brings them out with great power into their own land, to be their own people. Jesus use a similar language in the Sermon on the Mount when he says, Blessed are the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. The citizens of the kingdom are those who are poor, in spirit. He says, Blessed are the meek, for they shall inherit the earth that goes against what the world would think. And so God uses people and situations that seem to be useless, the situation is bleak, with no potential and He blesses them for his purposes. And you know, God is trying to do the same thing in the lives of his people, today. He takes situations of heartbreak, he takes moments of despair. He takes periods of life, of difficulty and challenge. And he can mold those or use those and turn them into something to you to be used for his purposes. When we come into the body of Christ, we're often leaving, we are leaving a life of sin. We're coming out of the desert, but God brings us into the valley of refreshing of healing and forgiveness. People come from relationships that are dysfunctional. But in the body of Christ, there is unity. There is genuine love between God's people. When we are without Christ, we're walking in darkness. So many people live life, they they don't know where they're going, they have no purpose or direction, or meaning but with, with God, we have our sense of direction. We know who we are, and why we're here. God can take a broken life and a wounded heart. And he can restore it, he can make it whole again. God transforms sinful, barren people into fruitful, joy filled followers. He can bless us immensely and that's what he says he's going to do here for those who receive his inheritance. Also, notice verse four. It says, Do not fear for you will not be ashamed, neither be disgraced for you will not be put to shame. For you will forget the shame of your youth and you will not remember the reproach of your widowhood anymore. For your maker is your husband, the Lord of hosts is his name. And your Redeemer is the Holy One of Israel. He is called the God of the whole earth. For the Lord has called you like a woman forsaken and grieved and Spirit like a youthful wife, when you were refused, says, says your God, for a mere moment I have forsaken you but with great mercies, I will gather you with a little wrath, I hid my face from you for a moment, but with everlasting kindness, I will have mercy on you, says the Lord, your Redeemer. I appreciate what Jim said before we took the Lord's supper together about that idea of redemption and what God did in order to release us to save us from our sins, what the price that he paid. And notice here in this text that the name Redeemer is given twice in verse five, it says, your Redeemer is the Holy One of Israel. In verse eight, it says he'll have everlasting kindness and mercy on you says the Lord, your Redeemer. To redeem something means to restore it, to buy it back, to place it back in, to, to service or to its rightful place. And Isaiah uses a analogy here, of a husband and a wife a bride. And he talks about what's going to happen to her. Throughout the book of Isaiah you see a picture of a bride Judah and Israel who was not very faithful in Isaiah.

Conrad Harkrider  15:04
In Isaiah chapter one and verse four it says, all sinful nation of people laden with iniquity, offspring of evil doers, children who deal corruptly. They have forsaken the Lord, they have despised the Holy One of Israel, they are utterly estranged. God's people had turned their backs on him. At the end of that verse there it says that they were estranged from him. This people that he had, had chosen, he had brought them out of slavery, he had made a special covenant with them, and now they are apart from him. But the promise that's given here in Isaiah 54, is that he is going to redeem them with everlasting love. He's going to buy them back, he's going to restore them, that special relationship and that covenant will be renewed. But what we see from the analogy of the marriages that Israel had had broken that they had turned away from God, and because of their faithful faithlessness, it was as if God had divorced them or put them away. He was turning away from them. Can you imagine what life would look like if God were to just completely leave us? If God were to leave us to our own? And let us stay in our sins? What would our life look like? What would the world look like if God were to completely and forever turn his back on us? We have these little pouches that we use for the kids snacks. And you can, they're reusable, you can take them and fill them up with different types of soft foods, applesauce, and yogurt. So one time we went on a walk, and we brought some of those along. And after we were finished, with our time together, we forgot to take them out of the stroller. And so there they stayed for several weeks. And when we opened them back up, it looked like a science experiment inside. The smell was horrendous green stuff growing all over. And that's what happens to us spiritually. When we're separated from the Lord. Sure things on the outside might might seem good. It might appear that things are going well. But inside of us, on the under underneath there is rotting and the foul smell of spiritual death. When we're cut off from the source of life, it's only a matter of time before decay and deterioration begin to set in. And that's the, the state that God's people were in. Jerusalem was about to be destroyed, the temple would be burned, people would be slaughtered, and those who survived would be carried off into captivity. But God reminds them that he is still going to be with his people. In verse four, he tells them, do not fear. Don't be ashamed. You won't be disgraced or put to shame. He's not going to remember their reproach. In verse five, he says that he is your maker, your husband, your Redeemer. God is going to restore them to set them free. In verse Not in verse seven, he says that it was just for a moment that he forced sick them. But yet with great mercy, he's going to gather them together, verse eight, with everlasting kindness, or love,

Conrad Harkrider  18:59
he's going to bring them back. Look at verse nine. He says, For this is like the waters of Noah to me, for I have sworn that the waters of Noah would no longer cover the earth. So I have sworn that I would not be angry with you, nor rebuke you, as God had made that promise to Noah that he would never again flood the earth and he put the rainbow in the sky to remind him of that promise. So it is here God is giving his word, he's not going to change his mind. He will never again forsake His people. In verse 10, it says, For the mountain shall depart and the hills be removed, but my kindness shall not depart from you. Nor shall my covenant of peace be removed, says the Lord, who had mercy who has mercy on you. The covenant that God had made with the children of Israel, it was conditional on their obedience, on their willingness to submit to you His commands. But here God has given them a new covenant. He calls it in verse 10, the covenant of peace, He says, My kindness or my love, will never depart from you. God will never take it away. Think about that just for a moment, ever lasting love. Divorce is a is a terrible thing. And so often when relationships break apart, in this world, people will say things like, I don't love them anymore. Or I don't feel the same way. Or their heart or their mind has changed towards that person. But God, what God is offering to his people is divine love. It's not love that has a limit. It's not unstable, and here one day but gone the next. It is constant unending, we cannot exhausted and that's reassuring us to know that no matter what we go through, no matter where we've been, or how much we've struggled, God is still there reaching out to us. In Romans chapter eight and verse 38. Paul says, For I am sure that neither life, neither death nor life, nor angels, nor rulers nor things present or things to come nor powers, nor height, nor depth, nor anything else in all creation, will be able to separate us from the love of God and Christ Jesus, our Lord. Nothing in this world can separate us from the love of God through Jesus Christ, our Lord, we have been redeemed or bought back with an everlasting love. Also, notice verse 11.

Conrad Harkrider  22:01
Verse 11, says, Oh, you afflicted one tossed with Tempest and not comforted. Behold, I will lay your stones with colorful gems and lay your foundations with sapphires, I will make your pinnacles of rubies, your gates with your gates of crystal, and all your walls of precious stones. All your children shall be taught by the Lord, and great shall be the peace of your children. In righteousness you shall be established, you shall be far from oppression, for you shall not fear and from terror for it shall not come near you. Notice how he describes them in verse 11. He says that they are tossed with Tempest, and not comforted. These are people that are being thrown about. Their life is unstable, it's uncertain. But God is going to do a complete renovation a makeover. And notice the terms that he uses to describe how they are going to be viewed. They're going to have these beautiful stones, these rubies and sapphires, their gates are going to be of crystal you can't help but think of Revelation Chapter 21. When God describes the New Jerusalem, the gates of pearl the streets of gold, God is going to turn his people into something that will be of great splendor and majesty, people will stand and be in awe of his people. And notice what it is that's going to cause them to stand out to be different. In verse 13, he says, all your children shall be taught by the Lord. The inheritance or the promise that God gives to His people is that they will be taught by the Lord. Notice he says that all will be taught not just a select few, not just the leaders or the elders, or those who had positions of prominence, but every single person, this would be a defining quality, this will be a characteristic that they would be taught of the Lord. This is in contrast to earlier in Isaiah, what he says about the people in chapter 29, Isaiah 29, in verse 13, therefore, the Lord said, in as much as these people draw near with their mouths and honor me with their lips, but have removed their hearts far from me, and their fear toward me is taught by the commandment of men. They were certainly being taught but it wasn't from the Lord. He says, the commandment of men. Jesus quotes, this same passage in Matthew chapter 15. When he's referring when he's interacting with the Pharisees and the scribes, they had challenged his disciples because they didn't wash their hands before they ate. And Jesus repeat use them and says that they that you are more concerned about your rules and your traditions than you are with keeping what the Lord has said. And this is a danger for, for all of us to start to place more emphasis on our own ideas or thoughts or opinions, where we make our decisions and our life is guided by what we think is best. And what what happens is, that's like building a house on a pile of sand. It is constantly shifting our emotions, our ideas, they're subject to change. And so it leads to instability. Notice that when Jesus was speaking to the Pharisees, and when Isaiah is speaking to these people, these are religious people. These are not pagans, who are atheists who don't believe in God, these are people who sacrifice they go to the temple, they had heard the word of the Lord. And yet, he says they had not been taught. They had missed the point. I have a known a few people that have taken music lessons when they were younger. And I was talking to one of my friends, and she was telling me about her piano lessons, and not just something that she did, you know, once or twice in her life. But this was every week, multiple times a week, she would go and sit with someone and they would work on this, this skill. And so for seven or eight years, she was learning how to play this instrument. So I were at the time we were around a piano and I said, Well, why don't you play something for us? She said, Oh, I don't play anymore. I don't, I'm not practicing anymore.

Conrad Harkrider  26:59
You see, a person can take lessons, they can learn the notes, they can know where to put their hands. But that doesn't mean they have a passion for it. That doesn't mean that it's something that's inside of their heart. It's not a part of them. And if you've ever been around a person who is a true musician, they are a little eccentric. They they carry their instrument with them everywhere. It's in the back of their car, they're always ready. They take it on the plane, they play when they're with groups, they play by themselves. It is a part of who they are. They love everything about it and to be taught by the Lord means more than just knowing information. It's more than just doing certain things coming to church. It is about being a disciple, a follower, an imitator of the Lord. And practically speaking, what that means is we share the same desires as Christ, we have the same heart. We share his love for other people, we serve others in the same way that he did. And we follow His word and seek after him with all of our heart. These people, those who received the inheritance of the Lord would be taught by the Lord. Finally, notice verse 15. Verse 15, says, Indeed, they shall surely assembled but not because of me, whoever assembles against you shall fall for your sake. Behold, I have created the blacksmith who blows the coals in the fire Who brings forth an instrument for his work. I have created the spoiler to destroy, no weapon formed against you shall prosper, and every tongue which rises against you in judgment, you shall condemn. This is the heritage of the servants of the Lord, and their righteousness is from me, says the Lord. The inheritance that God's people will receive. Isaiah says that they will be strengthened to overcome. Verse 15, says that those who try to get to come against them are going to fall. Verse 16, he uses this image of the blacksmith the craftsman who is making the sword, the axe, the spear. And the Lord reminds them that, yes, he may be making those things for war, those instruments to kill and destroy. But God is ultimately the one who makes him who makes the craftsmen. In other words, the Lord is the creator of everything He rules over all. He is ultimately in control over all the earth. In verse 17, he says, No weapon that's fashioned against you will succeed. The tongue that rises against you, it's going to be put down when the Lord is on there. sigh There is nothing that's going to be able to come against them and defeat them. If you remember, in the days of Hezekiah, the Assyrians came down and they camped around Jerusalem, and they were about to besiege the city. And Isaiah chapter 36 And verse 30. And 37 tells about that whole ordeal about how God was able to provide deliverance for his people. Hezekiah and his army did not even lift up a sword, and yet the enemy was completely decimated. What is the weapon that is fashioned against you? Is it temptation? Is there an ongoing sin or struggle that you're facing? Is it discouragement? Is it fear is it grief? The promise that God makes to his people is that he will stand behind them, that the power that is on our side is so much greater than anything that we face in this life. So often, when we struggle we feel like, like it's hopeless, like there's no point like it's too difficult or we can't go on. But we need to remember and think back to the promises that God has made. That the one who is with us is eternal, unmovable, unshakable, he is our source of strength. So when your legs are too tired to stand, remember that he will lift you up. And when your burden feels too heavy to and too great for you remember that he is going to carry you through our God will strengthen us to overcome.

Conrad Harkrider  31:52
Isaiah 54 is quoted in the New Testament by Paul in Galatians. Paul is talking about two different covenants. There's an old covenant that he made at Mount Sinai. That was a covenant of bondage and slavery, slavery because the law could not take sin away from us. But then there is a new covenant one described here in Isaiah 54, which Paul quotes. He says in Galatians, four and verse 26, but the Jerusalem above is free, and she is our mother. For it is written, rejoice. So bear in one who does not bear break forth and cry aloud you who are not in labor. For the children of the desolate one will be more than those of the one who has a husband. God provides a great inheritance for his people. He gives blessings to those who feel empty. He can redeem us and by us back with his everlasting love. We will be people who imitate and follow the Lord because we're taught by the Lord. And He will give us strength to persevere over the difficulties and temptations of this life. But ultimately, what this inheritance promises us is freedom. God says that the New Jerusalem you are free and no longer under bondage. And that's the great hope that we have through Jesus Christ, we can be set free from the sin and the death that has been hanging over the world since the beginning of time. This is an inheritance that is not random. God didn't just select people at random but it has been extended to every person who is willing to submit their life to Him. If you have a need this morning, we encourage you to receive the Lord's invitation. If you're not a child of God, you can become one by submitting your life to Him repenting of your sins. being buried with Christ and baptism. You can be raised to walk a new life. If there's something that we can do to encourage or help you this morning, please come down to the front as we stand in seeing
