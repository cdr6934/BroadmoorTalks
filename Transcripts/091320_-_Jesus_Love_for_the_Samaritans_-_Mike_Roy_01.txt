In the midst of a lot of uncertainty and dealing with this virus that we've been talking about for quite a while, we still have this common bond this fellowship where we are bound together in love. And we continue to maintain that connection as we keep our eye on the goals and it's great to worship together with you all this morning. Appreciate Gil's message this morning. Again, it reminds us that God is greater and bigger. We have a hope that anchors our soul that we can overcome no matter what comes our way. So the worship that we've engaged in appreciate JDS message at the Lord's Supper we were reminded of the grace and the mercy of God of Jesus Christ, we all need it every single day of my life, I need God's mercy and grace. And I trust that you do as well. This morning I want to challenge you with is we want to become more like Jesus Christ, we need to maintain the attitude that he had and the love that he showed towards other people, especially in terms of evangelism. You think back to the Old Testament times the Assyrian and Babylonian captivity is related to Israel. In the north and Judah in the South were traumatic experiences. One of the things that came about, I believe in connection with the Assyrian captivity, is that they repopulated Israel with people from Sumeria. And so a new kind of race of people was formed kind of a mixed race. And, and so, because of that, the the tensions were very great between the Jewish people, Jewish leaders, and the people of Sumeria. And so even the New Testament, we see that the the Jewish leaders maintained a strong disdain for an even hatred for the people of Sumeria. On the other hand, Jesus showed them compassion and mercy and love. The Jewish leaders tended to view the Samaritans as worthless and hopeless. And I believe Jesus saw them as prospects for his heavenly kingdom. And I think one of the greatest challenges that we have today is learning to love like Jesus loves learning to see other people the same way that Jesus loved learning to be evangelistic as Jesus was, in his day and time imitating that same attitude. So that means we got to get rid of all Pride and Prejudice. In love, all people deeply need to stop pre judging, who will and who will not respond to the gospel, and simply extend the gospel to all people. So this kind of maybe supplementing some things that John talked about several weeks ago about evangelism. But I want to look with you this morning at this

Mike Roy  02:49
lesson from the New Testament, and kind of the lesson Jesus love for the Samaritans. And that significant begin again, we'll see in this message this morning, there's a strong contrast between Jesus attitude towards the Samaritans. And the Pharisees and the scribes and the Sadducees. And, and especially the, the lawyers had such open disdain for the people of Sumeria. And so we want to follow Jesus example, especially in terms of loving others and reaching others with the gospel. And so we're going to be looking again, mainly at Jesus attitude and how that that plays out in the Scripture. So by way of kind of an overview, I want to suggest to you that Jesus showed us the importance of the people of St. Mary because he visited the region of Sumeria. Remember, he taught the woman at the well in John chapter four, we'll be looking at that here in a minute. Also, he told us the parable that a great the Good Samaritan in Luke chapter 10, again, illustrating his love for his compassion for the people of some area. Again, the Jewish leaders despised that group of people. And I think our challenge is to love people the same way that Jesus did, and not despise any people of any race or any background, social economic differences, color of skin education, all that stuff cannot matter as we as Christians, seek to reach out to those who are lost. And then I want to remind us that Jesus commanded His disciples to take the gospel specifically to Sumeria. That would have been something that would make the Jewish leaders aghast they glue couldn't comprehend that. But as you look at a New Testament, we see these things. So I think I've got all the scriptures on the screen this morning. So we'll be looking at that this morning. But the so the first thing I want us to see is that, that Jesus had a profound love for and compassion for the people of Sumeria. They were a despised kind of A mixed race. And they were despised, especially by the Jewish people, the Jewish leaders, you can see that from this map this morning, that God is down in the south. And then Sumeria is kind of midway up towards the coast. And then further up is Galilee, do you see the other areas there. But this what we're talking about this area of Sumeria is where of course the Samaritans live. And, and that kind of gives a quick picture of, of this Bible lands that we're fairly familiar with. So let's talk first about about in John chapter four. So the first point that I want to stress is again, that Jesus illustrated his love for the people of Sumeria. By going there, are there places on Earth that we don't want to go because we don't think people are worthy of the gospel, they're not going to respond, we may be preached, judge them. So notice the text over here. In John chapter four. In verse one, it said, When Jesus learned that the Pharisees had heard that Jesus was making it baptizing more disciples than John, although Jesus himself did not baptize only His disciples, He left you d and departed, again for Galilei, and he had to pass through some areas, I'll just highlight that for a moment. It says there that he had to pass through some area, again, looking back at that map.

Mike Roy  06:31
GDL is down to the south until basically, you see if you went straight north of Judea on the map, you'd see that some area is between Judea and Galilee. So it'd be a natural direction to go. But I'm told it in in the times of Jesus in the New Testament times, very often the Jewish people because they had such disdain for the people of Sumeria would go in that direction, then go around that region to get onto Galilee, or some of the place. But the text that we're looking at over here, it's interesting that we said in verse four that he had to pass through some area now, maybe physically he did, but it may be also an intentional statement on Jesus parts that he wanted to reach them with the gospel. So he came through a town of Samaria called sidecar near the field that Jacob had given to a son Joseph Jacobs well was there so Jesus wearied as he was from his journey was sitting beside the well. It was about the sixth hour. And in verse seven, a woman from Sumeria, a woman from Sumeria, came to draw water. Jesus said to her, give me a drink, for his disciples had gone away to the city to buy food. And of course, the Samaritan woman said to him, how is it that you a Jew, asked for a drink from me, a woman of Samaria, again, revealing the tension between the Jews and the Samaritans? First, in the same verse, the parenthetical statement, though, indicates the attitude of this day and time says for Jews have no dealings with Samaritans. That's kind of an understatement that Jews did not want to have any interaction with the people of some area. So everything that Jesus does in his ministry, in his teaching in his commission to his apostles, would be in contrast to the attitude of

Mike Roy  08:25
the Jews in his day. So again, it just reminds us that the Jews have no dealings with the people of Sumeria. But you know, the story Jesus talked with her confront sirs, she, no, he shows her that she is a sinful woman, but he has compassion for her. He is offering her the gift of eternal life, though, to drink freely from the water from living water. And so he continues to have this life changing discussion with her. And she was obviously moved by that. Notice again, since we're familiar with his passage, and was going to highlight a few key verses. And then in verse 27, it says, Just then his disciples came back, they marveled that we use he was talking with a woman, but no one said, What do you see? Or why are you talking with her? So the woman left her water jar and went away into the town and said to the people, come see a man who told me all that I ever did, did. And she said, raise a question, can this be the Christ? So Jesus is engaging a Samaritan woman who comes to understand that He is the promised Messiah? And so, as a result of this woman's influence, it says, They went out of the town and recommit and this is Samaritans. Samaritans, despised, rejected, ridiculed, hated by the Jews are coming to Jesus. The Jews didn't want that. They should have known but they should have been they were a light to the nations and to the Gentiles and everybody else. But So Jesus says gages this woman, and she is coming to the conclusion of he is the Messiah, the town comes out to meet him. And again, look at the again, these are verses that were familiar with them just kind of highlighting some key thoughts here. It says in verse 39, that many Samaritans, from that time believed in him because of the woman's testimony. All these Samaritans believing in Jesus, because of this woman's testimony, says he told me all that I ever did. And so when the Samaritans came to him, they asked him to stay with him. And he stayed there two days, and notice there and many more believed, because of his word. So again, Jesus goes directly into some area, it would have been the natural route. While many of the Jews in the first century would just kind of circumvent that area. And look what happens the Samaritans came to know about Jesus Christ, and many of them believe in that one woman who had five husbands, and certainly is an immoral woman, she came to understand who she who Jesus was at her need for him. She was impacted by him believed in him. And and so she influenced many in that town. And so in verse 42, says, Then they said to the woman, it is no longer because of what you said that we believe, for we have heard for ourselves, and we know that this is indeed the Savior of the world. So again, you look at this account in John chapter four, a well known passage that that's familiar to most of us, again, we're reminded not just about people coming to know Jesus Christ coming to believe in trust in him in and with a with a certain level of conviction. But these were Samaritans. These were people of some area, the Jews remember that parenthetical statement, the Jews had no dealings with the people of some area. Of there are some people that we have no dealings with, because we don't like the color of their skin, or their educational background, or what country they're from, or they speak with a different accent. And God's Kingdom is made up of people from all races and tribes and creeds and backgrounds. And so again, we need to follow Jesus lead by maintaining the same kind of attitude that he had for other people. So John, chapter four, shows us Jesus attitude towards the people of Sumeria, his love for them, that he was not afraid to break with tradition. And he demonstrated his love by engaging in this woman, and countless people came to believe in Him because of this woman. Secondly, I want us to focus on when we think about the

Mike Roy  12:53
Sumeria. And the Samaritans, what comes to mind, of course, is the parable of the Good Samaritan, that we're so familiar with that. So I'm not going to go through that whole text here, I just made going to read some read briefly this account. So verses 25, through 29. Give us the background for this well known parable, this teaching of Jesus, it says, And behold, a lawyer stood up to put him to the test saying, teach you what shall I do to inherit eternal life? He said to him, what is written in the law? And how do you read it? And he answered, You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, with all your strength, and with all your mind, and your neighbor as yourself, any and he said to him, you have answered correctly do this, and you will live. And so first of all, let me just say this by way of emphasis again, the most important issue in life for every human being, is loving God, with all of our heart, mind, soul and strength. Don't read past it quickly. That's my challenge. That's your challenge, to love him so much, that will obey him without question completely and totally. So this Jesus is listening or responding to this lawyer, and asked, answering his question about what what to do to inherit eternal life. And so, first and foremost, we have to love God, with every fiber of our being. That's that's our first responsibility. And but notice in verse 29, but he the lawyer, desiring to justify himself said to Jesus and who was my neighbor? Such dishonesty such hypocrisy, you know who the lawyer was? This was not just somebody studying law like we have in our culture today. The lawyer was an expert in the law of Moses. He knew the law of Moses inside and out backwards and forwards. He was an expert in Jewish law. He was an expert in the law of God. And so Does he not know who his neighbor is, of course, are all kinds of instructions about loving your neighbor, caring for your neighbor helping your neighbor. But he doesn't want to help certain neighbors because they have a different nationality, different background. And so he's prejudiced. And no, although he's an ex, he's supposed to be the expert in the Mosaic Law. He has some terrible prejudices that Jesus is going to expose. So in this parable, again, Jesus responded to this man, he said that a fiddle lawyer to the man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, an elevation and he fell among robbers, who stripped him and beat him and departed, leaving him half dead. Now, by chance, a priest was going down that road, and when he saw him, he passed by on the other side. So likewise, a Levite, when it came to the place and saw him pass by on the other side, but a Samaritan what, so Jesus is teaching this lawyer, the expert in the law of Moses, about the meaning of the law, the first two of the greatest two commandments. And he does by using a character in this message, who was a Samaritan, again, who was despised and hated by the by the Jewish leaders. So he's talking to a Jewish Jewish expert, and says, Let me tell you what it means to be a neighbor. And he is so bugged by contrast, because the man is when the injured man has beaten his left by half dead, the priest again, he's supposed to be another one of these super religious Jewish leaders. He looks at the guy and turns his face away and passes by the leaves that was like an assistant to the priests, same thing. They knew the law of Moses, inside and out. He looked over there and saw the man and went on the other side of the street. But a Samaritan Samaritan as he journeyed, came to where he was. And when he saw him, he had compassion. Imagine that. This most despised person, the Samaritan, has compassion on the stranger, who went to him and bound up his wounds, pouring on oil and wine. Then he set him on his own animal and brought him to an inn and took care of him. And the next day, he took out to dinner II and gave them to the innkeeper, saying, Take care of him, whatever you whatever more you spend, I will repay you when I come back. Which of these three do you think proved to be neighbor to the man who fell among the robbers? So Jesus is teaching this, this lawyer, the meaning of what a neighbor is and who his neighbor would be? And Jesus illustrated in this particular message that a Samaritan man was moved by compassion helped this individual took care of him, told him people want to come back from my trip, I'll pay whatever more you need, need, as you've taken care of him. And so Jesus in verse 36, just asked a question, which of these three do you think prove to be a neighbor?

Mike Roy  18:05
Excuse me, to the man who fell among the Roberts? Well, on the text, verse 33, says, A Samaritan is identified there. So the answer that the lawyer should have said, was the Samaritan man, what proved to be the neighbor? That what he said, No, what he said was the one who showed him mercy, he couldn't even say the word Samaritan. Because his hatred was so deep seated, he could not utter the words of Jesus said him go and do likewise. So again, Jesus is illustrating the importance of loving those, even from a different background, even people who might be despised by a certain culture, that we had to rise above that and practice compassion and mercy in understanding as certainly if this Samaritan can practice that type of compassion and mercy to a total stranger. Surely, we can be merciful and compassionate and understanding with each other as brothers and sisters in the body of Christ as we sang this morning, we are one we belong to God, we belong to one another. And it doesn't matter our racial background, our educational background, our culture, as most of you know, I obeyed the gospel many years ago as a Yankee. And I've been in southern churches my whole life, and in some capacity, and I've been welcomed in, in spite of my Yankee accent, although I've lost that having lived in the South for a very long time. Although some people do say I still have the Yankee accent. That doesn't matter if you're a Yankee or a southerner. In God's kingdom, we are all one. And so it's a reminder that that is this Samaritan illustrated what it means to be a neighbor. That means we practice compassion, mercy and understanding. Well, there's one other A section of scripture I want to look at the third point this morning is to understand that Jesus commanded, instructed His disciples to take the gospel, specifically to Sumeria. Again, reminding ourselves that Sumeria was a despised region, and the Jews wouldn't even go there if they could help that. So this is following Jesus resurrection. And before His ascension, he gathered his apostles together there to accept one. It says, Some when they had come together and asked him, Lord, will You at this time restore the kingdom to Israel, He said to them, it is not for you to know the times or seasons that the Father has fixed by his own authority, but you will receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you. And you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem. First, all Judea, and Samaria. Take the gospel to Sumeria, the Jewish leaders could even stomach that idea. But in this commission that He gives His apostles before His ascension back to his father, he said, you're going to be my witnesses. And Jerusalem, ngd in St. Mary, and yes to the end of the earth, and we still carry out that commission today. So we got to be careful that we're not like the Jewish leaders, oh, we're not gonna go to this country, or this nation, because of idolatry or witchcraft or voodoo, whatever is going on there. Jesus says, take the Gospel to the end of the earth, including, specifically he said, some area, again, is you look in the book of Acts of Jesus. The truth of Jesus teaching is emphasized with his apostles. Another passage we're looking at and accept the eight verse that Nick read for so just a little bit ago. So this is following Stephens execution, Sol approves of that. And again, it says, and there are Rosen that they had great persecution against the church in Jerusalem. They're all scattered throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria. So again, the Great Commission is being fulfilled by Philip in other followers of Christ, the Apostles. We see what happened to the development buried Steven made great limitation over him saw was revving the turret ravaging the church and verse four, now those who are scattered about went preaching the Word. And Philip, it says, went down to the city of Sumeria. So again, Jesus emphasized to his apostles to His disciples, the importance of taking the gospel to some areas, specifically, what happens in Sumeria, they have a great revival, a great revival, and the Jews would not have envisioned that type of thing. So Philip goes down to the city of St. Mary and proclaim to them Christ. Great crowd. So

Mike Roy  23:05
with one accord paid attention, what was being said, by Philip, unclean spirits were coming out. And Verse eight says that there was much joy in that city. salumeria is rejoicing. Because of the preaching of the Gospel, Jesus said, it was important to take the gospel to every place in that region, including Sumeria, the often despised region, and that day in time, so you continue to look at the text over here. It mentioned that there was a man Simon who had previously practice Magic in the city. He amazed again, these types of people have some errors. So he's in some area, he obeys them. They're paying attention to him, they think He is the great power of God. But notice the contrast. So what Simon is doing with his magic in verse 12, but when they believed Philip as he preached good news about the Kingdom of God in the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized both men and women. So an area of Palestine in the first century that was despised by the Jewish people in general, especially the Jewish leaders became a, a hotbed of revival, a great spiritual revival takes place in of all places. Some married men and women heard the gospel, they believed they were baptized. And even Simon is mentioned, we know the story. He wanted to buy that power that the apostles had. But it's just interesting to note that in Sumeria, we had such a tremendous revival. And then notice, in verse 14, when the apostles at Jerusalem heard that some Marissa had received the word of God, that's the point he's making here. So Marissa had received God's word. They said to him, Peter, and John, who came came down and pray for them that they might receive the Holy Spirit I had, Nick just kind of stop here at this context. But the point I'm making over here is that Jesus told His apostles, you take the Gospel, you're my witnesses in Jerusalem and Judea, and Samaria, and they're in the remotest part of the earth, they do that type of thing. So Mary receives the Word of God. And I was, as I was looking over this lesson, I guess, yesterday, I want to add another verse, verse 16, says, For he had not yet fallen, any of them, but they had only been baptized named Lord Jesus, then they lay their hands on them these Samaritans and they receive the Holy Spirit. God's love is so powerful, any person can be saved if they're willing to obey the gospel. And so that, again, is significant. When you think about how how despised this region was, and yet Jesus made it a priority to go there himself to teach lessons that would shock the Jewish leaders like the the lawyer in Luke chapter 10. And then his, his apostles, his disciples followed his instructions, went to Sumeria. And I guess you would say, in conducted one of the great revival, and people obey the gospel, in a city that would have been cut off and rejected by the establishment in Israel at that they in time to the point that they obey the gospel, they receive God's pair. So God lives in them through God's Word, He abides, and then they become part of the fellowship that were a part of today. One other verse I want to look at before we bring the listen to close this morning, accept the nine, verse 31. But again, shows us kind of a summary statement of what's happening in excuse me, in the book of Acts, it says, so the Church throughout all, excuse me, throughout all Judea, and Galilee, and Samaria, had peace and was being built up in walking in the fear of the Lord. And in the comfort of the Holy Spirit, it multiplied. So remember that map and I put that up originally. So Jesus would have gone from Judea down in the south, go through some Mariya and get up to Galilee in these regions were prospering spiritually, because of the preaching of the gospel. So this statement and accepted nine, verse 3031, is kind of a summary statement, showing us the success of the gospel in all of these regions, including even scenario. So it's a significant

Mike Roy  27:47
point, I think that needs to be made. And, and I think it just challenges us to raise this question I leave with you this morning. Do we love other people like Jesus did? Do we practice evangelism the same way that Jesus did? Do we love our brothers and sisters in Christ like Jesus did? And do we have the same kind of compassion towards one another, even when there are political differences, we live in a country with his great political divide, we've got a big election coming up. We know all that. And people have different there may be on different sides of the political spectrum, but in Christ, we are one and we want to love others and be compassionate towards others in the same way that to me that Jesus was and so hope it's a lesson that can challenge us as we seek to bring more people into God's kingdom. And as reminders we typically extend the invitation. God's love and His grace and compassion is available to all people, if they happen to be anyone who needs to respond to the gospel, maybe the prayers for the to help maybe to help change your your mindset to be more merciful and compassionate to people that you might in the past have not had that kind of an attitude. We can pray with you or for if you need to respond in any way come always stay in and sing this invitation song
