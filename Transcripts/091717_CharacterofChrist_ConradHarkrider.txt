It's good to see each of you here this morning, if you have a Bible and want to be turning to Philippians, chapter two.

Conrad Harkrider  00:26
One of the most intimidating and potentially terrifying moments when you're in a relationship with someone else is having to meet their family for the very first time. Now, hopefully that occurs long before you're married, although I have heard of some situations where people do have their first introductions on the wedding day. But that can be a very tense situation, I think there's a lot of pressure there. Because we want to be accepted, we want to have the approval of these people who are the closest to the person that we love. And it doesn't matter who it is the father, the mother, the sister, the grandma, anybody really in the family can put the heat on and make us feel that stress or that tension. Before I introduce Jessica, to my extended family who lived in another state, we were I was up there in the summer visiting with them, and I started getting the questions, you know, tell us about this girl, where did you meet her? And what is she like? And what types of things Is she involved in with school? And when you're answering those questions, you really tried to promote the person, right? You want to say things that are going to help people view them in a positive light, you don't want to say that they are extremely disorganized and always running late, you're gonna love her. Okay, you want to try to say things that are going to show their character, the type of person that they are, this person is kind. They're considerate, they're generous, or they're giving. And we tend to de emphasize things that are that are external, the clothes they like to where the car they drive, or how much money they have. Because really, that's those aren't the things that are most important, they external things. They tend to fade, they tend to lose significance. Shortly after you get married, but the character that's the person that you're living with, day in and day out. In Proverbs, it says a good name is to be chosen rather than great riches and favor is better than silver, or gold. This morning, we're going to look at a passage from the book of Philippians that I think emphasizes the type of character that we are to have, as we think about developing the right type of character, and not just any traits or personality but developing the character of Christ. Read with me in Philippians chapter two, beginning in verse 19, Philippians two and verse 19, it says, But I trust in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you shortly, that I also may be encouraged when I know of your state. For I have no one like minded who will sincerely care for your state, for all seek there, oh, not the things which are of Christ Jesus, but you know, his proven character that has a son with his father, he served with me in the Gospel. Therefore, I hope to send him at once as soon as I see how it goes with me. But I trust in the Lord that I myself shall also come shortly. And I considered it necessary to send to you a Pafford itis my brother, fellow worker and fellow soldier, but your messenger and the one who ministered to my need, since he was longing for you all, and he was distressed because you heard that he was sick. For indeed he was sick almost unto death. But God had mercy on him and not only on him, but also on me also, less I should have sorrow upon sorrow. Therefore I sent him the more eagerly that when you see him again you may rejoice and I may be less sorrowful, receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness and hold such men in esteem. Therefore the work because for the work of Christ, he came close to death, not regarding his life to supply what was lacking in your service toward me.

Conrad Harkrider  04:51
At the beginning of Philippians chapter two, Paul urges these Christians to be of the same mind to have the same heart the same feelings and attitude towards one another to be unit united. And apparently that was an issue for the believers here in Philippi. In chapter four and verse two, Paul specifically calls out to ladies Euodia. And since a key, and he says that I want you to be of the same mind to get on the same page. In order for that type of unity to exist in a group of people, there has to be an attitude and a spirit of humility, where each person considers the needs of others more significant than their own. And Paul doesn't just state this truth about humility, and then move on here in chapter two, he gives four different examples of this attitude being put into practice. He starts at the beginning of chapter two, and verse five, about Jesus Christ. And he talks about how he was willing to leave heaven and come to earth to put on the form of a man to submit himself to death, even death on a cross. In chapter two and verse 17, Paul mentions himself, he says that I am being poured out as a drink offering for on your account. And then here in verse 19, through the end of the chapter, Paul gives the example of these two men, Timothy, and a Pafford itis. Now I've met several Timothy's in my life. But I've never yet met an A Pafford itis not a common name. But maybe after looking at the character, and the traits of this man that might make it onto your list, some incredible things are said about him here in this text. In verse 19, it says that Paul wants to send Timothy to the Philippians. Paul is confined in a Roman prison. And he can't just travel wherever he wants to, nor can he pick up the phone and give them a call or video chat with them to try to get an update on how they're doing. The only way is to send a personal messenger or possibly even send a letter, and then wait to hear a response for them. And so Paul decides to send Timothy it wasn't uncommon for him to dispatch different people on various assignments. In First Timothy chapter one, Paul tells Timothy, stay in emphasis, I need you there, so that you can teach and refute those who were teaching things that were false. But in this case, Paul sends him to Philippi so that he can get an update on the church. Notice what it says about Timothy's character in verse 20. He says, For I have no one like minded who will sincerely care for your state. First of all, notice that Timothy was a man who had genuine concern for others. Did you notice what it said? Paul says, There is no one else who is like him or like minded as he is. Have you ever said that about a person? There's no one like them? Or has that ever been said about you? There's no one like you. You are one of a kind. That's typically not a compliment. You're a strange bird. But in this instance, Paul is holding up Timothy. He is saying that when you look among men in the kingdom, Timothy is different. He's special, there is no one that exhibits this type of attitude. It reminds us of what God said about Job and Job chapter one. In verse eight, when the Lord said to Satan, have you considered my servant Job that there is none like him on the earth, a blameless and upright man who fears God and turns away from evil Job chapter one and verse eight. What was it that made Timothy so unique, so different from the other people around him?

Conrad Harkrider  09:18
Traveling from Rome, which is where Paul is writing this letter, and presumably, Timothy is with him and he's sending him back to Philippi. That's not an easy journey. If you look on a just Google Maps or you tried to book a flight from Rome, to Philippi, it's about a four hour direct flight today. Of course, Timothy wasn't able to board a plane and just fly over the Mediterranean and he would have had to gone over land and sea on a boat, a journey that would have been very expensive, very time consuming, and most likely very dangerous. And yet, why would he do something like this because there was some type of job opportunity on the other end of it. Or because there was some great financial incentive, he was being paid really well to do this work, or because he was going to be recognized for his efforts by the city or the community or throughout the world. Know, Timothy makes this shirt this trip, because he genuinely cares about these brothers and sisters. And that's the type of stuff spirit and attitude that God desires to be developed in each one of us. These examples that are given to the Philippians are not just put these men up on a pedestal and say, Look how great these ministers are. Paul is writing to the Philippians, because he desires for these attitudes and attributes to dwell inside of each Christian, each follower of Christ. Think for just a few moments about the difference between real sincere concern and fake or pretend concern. Let's start with the negative. I knew of a situation where there was an elderly Christian who was living in a city and his family lived in another place. And he could, for the most part, take care of himself. But there was a woman who lived in town who was in her 40s. And she was just great to this man. She would go and pick him up, she would give him rides, she'd take him to the doctor, she'd go and get food for him. She would buy him clothes, all of these really generous acts. She wasn't a Christian, she didn't go to his church. She wasn't a part of the family and people who were looking at this, were sort of amazed, right? How is this person doing all of these things? Why is she showing so much love and kindness to this older man? Well, over the course of time, it came out that each time she would come and pick him up, he would give her $20 $30 $50. And so in a sense, she wasn't showing kindness, she was more providing a service, she was being compensated for her efforts, and potentially taking advantage of someone who was in a vulnerable situation. That's the way of the world showing some type of care or regard for a person because of what's in it for me, what am I going to get out of this situation? At work, people show kindness, because they're trying to position themselves, they're trying to move their way up the ladder gain some type of promotion. Maybe in a community or in a neighborhood people show kindness because they want to learn some information. They want to develop a relationship they want to get in a particular circle. They want to be associated with these groups of people. And all of a sudden, we see these different motives for why people do the things that they do. But think about someone who is genuinely genuinely concerned for you as a person, somebody in your life that just cares about you, because of you, because they love you. All of my grandparents have passed on. But I was blessed to know them for my childhood and into my early adulthood.

Conrad Harkrider  13:52
And when we would go and visit my grandmother, she would practically roll out the red carpet. She's stacking the pantry with all kinds of snacks and foods. She's making meals around the clock. She's preparing 10 Different kinds of desserts to for every appetite. It was almost a requirement that you had to gain five pounds when you're staying at her house. When you would talk to her if you told her something exciting happening in your life, about school sports, whatever. She would just glow and her face would show this excitement, this pride. It was almost as if she was the one that had experienced this. When you would tell her something that was difficult or challenging. She would feel a sense of pain as if it had happened to her if she was the one that was going through that. She loved us and desire for us to grow Oh and mature and be successful, even if it there was nothing in it for her. And the question is, what type of concern do we have for our brothers and sisters in Christ in the Lord's body? Do we love each other with that type of real, genuine, authentic concern? concern that says, I care about you just because you are a part of the body of Christ, not because there's something else that's in it for me, because I'm going to gain something or receive something back. If you think about Timothy, spending all of this time to go and visit people on another side of the known world. And yet he was motivated by his love and his concern for them. In Philippians, chapter two and verse three Philippians two and verse three, it says, Let nothing be done through selfish ambition or conceit, but in lowliness of mind, let each esteem others better than himself. When we start to consider others, more significant, more important, and better than ourselves, that allows us to then start having this genuine care and concern, because we see their needs as greater and more important than ours. Timothy, showed this genuine care. Also notice in verse 21, sec, Philippians chapter two and verse 21. It says, For all seek their own, not the things which are of Christ Jesus, but you know, his proven character that as a son with his father, he served with me in the Gospel, Paul says that everyone else is doing what? They're seeking their own interests. But instead, Timothy was a man who sought the Lord's interest. Timothy was concerned about the things of the Lord, not just is this going to help me in some way? But how is this going to benefit Jesus Christ in His kingdom? That's a challenge for us. Because we think about our interests, those are right in front of us. We are well aware of the things that we need. And they are the things that we desire and the things that we want. And it's easy for us to put them first because they benefit us. Last month, we had a major astronomical event here in Nashville. If you weren't around, we have the it was a total solar eclipse. Pretty impressive thing to see. But I heard a story about or know of someone who was outside getting ready for this event, and you couldn't look up at the sun, because of its brightness really should never look up at the sun. But during an eclipse, you can't look directly at the sun without wearing these protective glasses. This person was outside and they had their glasses, and they were getting ready for the big event to come. And they noticed there was a neighbor across the street who is also outside trying to watch the Eclipse. Except instead of looking through their glasses, they were holding up a cell phone and trying to watch the sun via via phone, which there's no app for that that doesn't work. What would you do and in that situation? It's been 400 years since we had an eclipse, total eclipse in Nashville. So that guy should have planned, he should have planned better, because there is no way I'm giving up these glasses.

Conrad Harkrider  18:56
That's what Paul is talking about here thinking only of our own interests. Worried about ourselves. I can't miss this. I have to see this. This person walked over to the neighbor's house. And they gave away their glasses. Now in fairness, they still were able to borrow a family member friends, and share and see and whatnot. But that's still incredible. And we think about what would you be willing to give up for a brother or sister in Christ? You might give up your Eclipse classes for your granddaughter? You'd say she I would rather her see it than me. But do we have that same type of love for those who are in Christ? For people that are members of the body? Do we share that same concern and love for them. In verse 22. It says, regarding Timothy of his proven character, Timothy was a man who was reliable. He had been tested, he had been found trustworthy. He served with Paul as a father, sir, as the son serves with his father, there's a good possibility that Timothy did not have a Christian, a believing father, were told an axe that his mother was a Jew and his father was a Greek, there's no indication that his father ever believed in the Lord. And there's a good chance that he grew up grew up in that mixed environment, that mixed situation where some of the people that were closest to him were not serving and following the Lord. Many of us today were blessed with godly Christian parents, people who, though imperfect, were seeking to do God's will and trying to teach their family in that same way. But some of you didn't grow up with those influences. And what we see in Timothy here is a man who was still able to grow into faith. He's working he's serving, he's contributing to the efforts of the gospel. And one of the things that Timothy was was able to do was to find a godly mentor, somebody who could support him who could encourage him and help him. It's important, not just for those who don't grow up in Christian homes, but all of us to surround ourselves with people who are going to add strength to our faith, not take away from it, and diminish it. Timothy, was a man who sought the Lord's interests ahead of his own. Well, how about the next example of Pafford itis. His name appears only twice in the scriptures here in the book of Philippians. And Chapter Four in verse 18. It says, Indeed, I have found I have all and abound, I am full, having received from Epaphroditus the things sit from you a sweet selling or a sweet smelling aroma, and acceptable sacrifice, well pleasing to God. Apparently, a Pafford itis was a messenger from Philippi, he brings Paul a gift. During this time, if you were in prison, they didn't give you your three daily meals and a nice accommodations, you are expected to be cared for and provided for by your friends, by your family, by people that knew you. And so if Halford Epaphroditus apparently brings this care package from Philippi to Rome, on Paul's behalf. In chapter two and verse 25, Paul refers to him as a brother, a fellow worker, a soldier, one who had ministered to his needs. And then look at what verse 26 says, since he was longing for you all, and he was distressed because you heard that he was sick. For indeed, he was sick almost unto death. But God had mercy on him and not only on him, but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow. Apparently, while Pafford itis has gone to Rome, he has become sick he's been he becomes ill, not just some type of little cold or, you know, infection, but he is to the point where he's about to die, he's close to death.

Conrad Harkrider  23:49
But notice what it says about him here. In verse 26, he was distressed when he heard that they were when they heard about him being sick. In terms of his character, we see him being distressed by others pain. He was concerned about the way that they were taking this, the way that they were handling the news about him getting sick. So think about this situation. He goes on this mission, he becomes ill, the Philippians hear about it, they start to worry that that kind of makes sense. You send somebody on a mission and something happens and now you're you're concerned about them. But when a Pafford itis hears about their worry, he becomes distressed and he is concerned about them. Does that make any sense? What happens to us typically when we get sick when something happens when we hurt our leg or we get in have to go to the hospital, whatever. How are we thinking what are what is our focus on when we're sick? We feel so all right for ourselves, right? I wish I could get out of this bed or I wish I wasn't feeling crummy like this, or I wish I was feeling better. Our vision becomes narrowly focused on ourselves. And in some ways, that's, that's natural. That's a normal feeling. But what Paul shows the Philippians is here is a man who was sent on this journey, putting himself at risk, he gets sick. And when he hears about the discouragement of the Philippians, that's his main concern. How is this affecting my brothers? How are they being impacted by this? Not just when we're sick, but all of the time are we moved by the pain and the hurt of other people. In Romans chapter 12, in verse 15, it says, Rejoice with those who rejoice and weep with those who weep. The past couple of weeks have been pretty stressful for a lot of people in the United States with all the hurricanes and the storms that have been coming through. And if you have family members that have lived in one of those areas, then you know, the feeling of being anxious of being distressed, or being concerned about someone who is living in a place that may be dangerous. But the challenge for us as God's people, as the family of God is to feel those same feelings of concern not just for our, our children, or our relatives or people within our family, but for all of God's people. So when someone is dealing with a difficulty, there's a couple that's trying to get pregnant, and having a hard time with that. There's a family who somebody has lost a job, or they're going through some type of financial challenges. Here's a person who has been dealing with an ongoing physical illness, they just can't seem to get back to their normal health. Here's a person who feels isolated, and alone, they don't feel like they really connect with anyone. There are so many needs in the body, and just looking around, and placing ourselves in that position. And being able to have a sense of sympathy and, and being understanding having a tender heart. In Matthew chapter nine, in verse 36, it says, When he saw the crowds, he had compassion for them, because they were harassed and helpless, like sheep, without a shepherd. This might be the most defining quality of Jesus. He cared about other people. And when these giant multitudes came to him, he didn't just look out and see some type of opportunity, or he didn't just look out and say, here's a, this is really great for my fame and my note notoriety, he saw them as people, and he cared about them. And if we are to develop the character of Christ, it should pain us when others are going through challenges through hard times.

Conrad Harkrider  28:33
We should weep with those who weep. Philippians chapter two, and verse four, says, let each of you look out not only for his own interests, but also for the interests of others. Again, Paul gives this introduction and then he's using these examples to show what does what does that look like? What does that mean? Well, finally, a Pafford. Itis was a man who displayed the character of Christ because He risked his life for Christ. Look at verse 29. It says, receive him therefore in the Lord with all gladness and hold such men in esteem, because for the work of Christ, he came close to death, not regarding his life to supply what was lacking in your service toward me. Paul tells the Philippians I want you to esteem and honor these types of men. These are the men that should be held up in your presence. Because here, a Pafford itis risked his life he put his life on the line in service for these people. Most likely, you and I are not going to be called upon to do something that would risk our lives for the cause of Christ. But Jesus does say that those who who follow Him must give up everything in Luke chapter 14 In verse 26, it says, If anyone comes to Me and does not hate his own father and mother, wife and children, brothers and sisters, yes, and even his own life, he cannot be My disciple. Jesus isn't telling them to literally hate their families. But what he is saying is that in order to be a disciple of follower of Christ, we have to be willing to give up anything, even if it's one of the closest relationships that we have in this world. And ultimately, it means being willing to give up our life, being willing to give up our desires, our pursuits, to enable to to in order to serve the Lord. We have to love the Lord and care about others, more than we do our own lives. And when we develop that type of character, man, those are the those are the funerals that preach. When you find a person that is genuinely concerned, for others, someone who has sought the Lord's interests, they've been distressed when others have been in pain, and they have given their life and service to God. When it comes time to talk about who they were and what they did on this earth, there's no fighting for words. There's no grasping for things to say. That is a genuine character that impacts the people around them, and generations to come. We're going to close this morning with an invitation if there's something that we can do to encourage you to help you and your walk with Christ. Please come down to the front as we stand and sing
