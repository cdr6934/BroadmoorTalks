most profound conversions that we see are recorded in the New Testament is that of Saul of Tarsus. There's no greater change I think that we we see anywhere else. He made a complete 180 degree turn around. He went from one who was terrorizing the church, to one who became its greatest component, greatest proponent. Let's look at Acts chapter eight, to get a feel for that change that took place. X chapter eight in verse three we read, but Saul was ravaging the church. In entering house after house, he dragged off men and women and committed them to prison. And then over in chapter nine, verse one, but saw still breathing threats and murder against the disciples of the Lord went to the high priest and asked him for letters to the synagogues that Damascus, so that if he found any belonging to the way, men or women, he might bring them bound to Jerusalem. And he was about to do that as well in Damascus, as we see going on there. In chapter nine, he was on his way to Damascus, to find Christians to take them and imprison them or put them to death. But something happened as he was making that journey that made a complete change a complete transformation in his life, because a bright light shone, and he heard a voice from heaven, asking him, what is he doing, Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me? And He answered, who are you, Lord? And he said, I'm Jesus, whom you're persecuting. And that statement that recognition that meeting of Jesus on the Way to the mascus made a complete change in Paul's life. Let's look down at verse 10, where we see the Lord appearing to Anna NYAS and telling him about what has happened. In X nine, verse 10. Now there was a disciple at Damascus named Anna NYAS. The Lord said to him in the vision and an iris and he said, Here I am, Lord, in the Lord said to him, Rise and go to the street called straight. And at the house of Judas, look for a man of Tarsus named Saul, for behold, he is praying. And he has seen in the vision a man named Anand is come in, and lay his hands on him so that he might regain his sight. But Anand is answered, Lord, I've heard from many about this man, how much evil he has done to your saints at Jerusalem. And here he has authority from the chief priests to bind all who call on your name. But the Lord said to him go, for he is the chosen instrument of mine, to carry my name before the Gentiles in Kings in the children of Israel, for I will show him how much he must suffer for the sake of My name. That last verse is very interesting. The Lord was going to show Paul how much he must suffer. So this one who had brought suffering upon the people of God was now going to become the recipient of that suffering. So Jesus was truly asking him to count the cost. You know, we wanted to make sure that he knew what he was getting himself into. But Paul, went right ahead. Once he saw Jesus, once he knew that Jesus was truly the Son of God, he gave himself wholeheartedly to proclaiming the gospel, in that same zeal that had been directed at Christians now was directed to making Christians helping other people know about the Lord. And he list a few of those things that he suffered throughout his life in Second Corinthians 11. So let's take a look at those Second Corinthians 11, beginning in verse 24. Five times I received at the hands of the Jews, the 40 lashes less one. Three times I was beaten with rods once I was stoned. Three times I was shipwrecked. A night in a day I was adrift at sea, on frequent journeys in danger from rivers, danger from robbers, danger in the wilderness, danger from own people danger from Gentiles, danger in the city, danger in the wilderness, danger at sea danger from false brothers in toil and hardship, through many a sleepless night, in hunger and thirst, often without food, in cold and exposure. And apart from other things, there is the daily pressure on me of my anxiety for all the churches. When we look at that list of suffering, I doubt any of us have suffered to that extent. So Paul certainly was one who was acquainted with suffering. Let's notice an instance of suffering that he faced in Acts chapter 16

Unknown Speaker  05:07
That's chapter 16. When Paul and Silas came to the city of Philippi, in were teaching the gospel there, He cast out a spirit of divination of a slave girl. And her masters got upset with that, about that because she was bringing them much money money through their fortune telling. And so in verse 19, of acts 16, we read, for winter owners saw that their hope of gain was gone. They sees Paul and Silas in drag them into the marketplace before the rulers. And when they brought them to the magistrates, they said, These men are Jews, and they are disturbing our city. They advocate customs that are not lawful for us as Romans to accept or practice. The crowd join in attacking them, and the magistrates tore the garments off them, and gave them orders to beat them with rots. And when they had inflicted mini blows upon them, they threw them into prison, ordering the jailer to keep them safely. Having received this order, he puts them into the inner prison and fasten their feet in the stalks. About midnight, Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and the prisoners were listening to them. Did we hear that correctly? What was their response to being beaten, being thrown in prison? In in, in having their feed in stocks? Their response was they were singing and praying to God? How could they have that attitude? How could Paul deal with all the suffering that he faced in his life? Well, I think that his letter to the Philippians gives us insights on how he was able to deal with suffering, and can hopefully give us instruction as to how we can deal with the suffering and difficulties that we may face in our lives. So turn over to Philippians. And we'll spend most the rest of our time looking at passages from this book, Paul's letter to the Philippians. I'd like to point out four principles that I think, Paul that we see Paul teaching in this book, that were a help to him in dealing with the sufferings and trials that he face. First of all, I'd like to suggest that Paul recognize that God was at work in the lives of his people. Let's look first at verse six of chapter one. He says, I'm sure of this, that he you began a good work, and you will bring it to completion at the day of Jesus Christ. God has a good work that he wants to work in our lives. God has purpose for us. And he wants to help us grow into the likeness of his son, and to be in fellowship with Him. He wants us to be able to enjoy eternal life. And so the things that he allows to come into our life, there's purpose there, in even though we may not be able to see the purpose for the trials and sufferings we face because of our limited vision. God has a purpose, and God can make good come from it. In chapter two, verses 12 and 13. We read, therefore, my beloved, as you have always obeyed. So now not only as in my presence, but much more in my absence, work out your own salvation with fear and trembling, for it is God who works in you both to will and to work for His good pleasure. Again, we see God has a purpose in our lives. He wants, there's a work that he wants to do, there's a will, that he has a purpose that He has for our lives. And then in verse 27, Philippians, two, talking about Epaphroditus, who had brought a gift from the Philippians to Paul, and while he was there with Paul had become sick. In verse 27 of chapter two, Paul says, Indeed, he was ill near to death, but God had mercy on him, and not only on him, but on me also, lest I should have sorrow upon sorrow. So we see that God had mercy upon he Pafford itis and allowed him to recover from his illness because he still had work that he wanted him to accomplish. And then over in chapter four of Philippians, starting in verse 10,

Unknown Speaker  09:35
Paul says, I rejoice in the Lord greatly that now at least you have revived your concern for me. You were indeed concern for me, but you had no opportunity. Not that I'm speaking of being in need for I've learned in whatever situation I am to be content. I know how to be brought low. And I know how to a bound in any in every circumstance, I have learned the secret of facing plenty and hunger abundance in need, I can do all things through Him who strengthens me. So Paul said he went through times where he didn't have food to eat. He went through times when he had plenty of food to eat. He went through times where he didn't have money for his needs. He went time through times, we had plenty of money to get what he needed. But in all those situations, God was still with him. And Christ was strengthening him for those situation that he faces. And in the same way God will be with us will be at work in our lives in strengthen us and provide us help for the things that we may go through. And then in verse 19, and Philippians, four, as Paul's talking about the gift, the monetary gift that the Philippians had sent to him, he said in my God will supply will supply every need of yours, according to his riches in glory in Christ Jesus, God knows our needs, and He will supply those needs, he will provide the help the strength, the blessings that we need, if we are seeking to follow him. So I suggest that the first reason Paul was able to deal with his sufferings was that he recognized God was at work, God was in control. These things that were happening to him weren't happenstance. But there was a purpose behind them and God had good that he could bring out of those situations. The second thing that I think Paul recognized that helped him in dealing with the struggles of life was that he made knowing Christ and living for Him the top priority in his life. Let's look at chapter one starting in verse 19. For I know that through your prayers, and the help of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, this will turn out for my deliverance, as it is my eager expectation and hope that I will not be at all ashamed, but with it, but that with full courage now, as always, Christ will be honored in my body, whether by life or by death. For to me to live is Christ and to die is gain. If I'm to live in the flesh, that means fruitful labor for me, yet, which I shall choose, I cannot tell. I'm hard pressed between the two. My desire is to depart and be with Christ for that as far better, but to remain in the flesh is more necessary on your account. Convinced of this, I know that I will remain and continue with you all for your progress and joy in the faith. So that in me, you may have Apple calls to glory in Christ Jesus, because of my coming to you again. So when Paul writes this letter, he was in prison, and he wasn't sure what the outcome would be of his imprisonment, he could be put to death, or he could be released and be able to go back to the Philippians and be with him in person again. But he said, either way, he's okay. Because his purpose in living was serving Christ. So if Christ wanted him to live longer and continue doing work for him, he was happy with that, if it was time for him to be put to death. Paul was happy with that too, because that's gain form there. He's in the presence of God and it no longer has to endure the sufferings of this life. So either way he won. The worst that someone can do to us as far as physical suffering in this life is putting us putting us to death. But for Christians, that's game to us. So there's nothing to fear. If we keep in mind that our top priority in life is knowing Christ in serving him. Let's look over in chapter three, starting in verse two.

Unknown Speaker  13:53
flippin three verse two, Paul says, look out for the dogs look out for the evil doers. Look out for those who mutilate the flesh. For we're in the circumcision who worshiped by the Spirit of God and glory in Christ Jesus, and put no confidence in the flesh, though I myself have reason for confidence in the flesh also, if anyone else thinks he has reason for confidence in the flesh, I have more circumcised on the eighth day of the people of Israel, of the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew of Hebrews, as to the law of Pharisee, as to zeal a persecutor of the church has to righteousness under the law, blameless. But whatever gain I had I counted as loss for the sake of Christ. Indeed, I count everything as loss because of the surpassing worth of knowing Christ Jesus, my Lord, for his sake I've suffered the loss of all things and count them is rubbish, in order that I may gain Christ and be found in him, not having a righteousness of my own that comes from the law, but that which comes through faith in Christ, the righteousness of God depends on faith, that I may know him in the power of his resurrection, and may share his sufferings, becoming like him in his death, that by any means possible, I may attain the resurrection from the dead. So Paul tells a little bit about his past life in Judaism. He was a rising star in Judaism. He was a leading Pharisee and up and coming leader of the Jews, and he had great prominence. But he said, when he met Jesus on the road to Damascus, he forgot about all that, all that went by the wayside. All his rabbinic credit credentials, all his pedigree in Judaism, it no longer mattered. Because what was important to him now was knowing Christ, having that relationship with Christ, and looking forward to being able to attain the resurrection from the dead, where that he could go to spin eternity with Christ in heaven. So that was what was important to him. So in light of that, giving up those things didn't matter. It didn't bother him, because it was far more important to be in a right relationship with Christ. And then in verses 20 and 21, we see that his loyalty changed, it was no longer grounded and rooted in this world, but it was rooted in heaven. He says in verse 20, but our citizenship is in heaven. And from it, we await a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ, who will transform our lowly body to be like his glorious body, by the power that enables him even to subject all things to himself. Since as Christians, our citizenship is in heaven, the things that happen on this earth don't matter that much in the long run. What's more important is our home with Christ and God and had since this body that we're living in currently is not our permanent body. It doesn't matter if we might have to endure suffering in this body. Because God is preparing a resurrection body for us, that will enjoy for all eternity, when we are raised to be with him. So when knowing Christ and living for Him is the top priority in our life, then the suffering that we may have to endure takes less prominence, because its its importance is not as great is our future. In third place, I'd like to suggest that one of the things that helped Paul in during sufferings was he looked at the self sacrificing example of Christ. And we see this chronicled in chapter two verses one through 11.

Unknown Speaker  17:51
Paul says, so if there's any encouragement in Christ, any comfort from love, any participation in the spirit, any affection and sympathy, complete my joy by being of the same mind, having the same love being in full accord and of one mind, do nothing from rivalry or conceit. But in humility, count others more significant than yourselves, that each of you let each of you look not only to his own interest, but also to the interest of others. Have this mind among yourselves which is yours in Christ Jesus, who, though he was in the form of God did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped, but made himself nothing, taking the form of a servant, being born in the likeness of men, and being found in human form, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a cross. Therefore, God has highly exalted him and bestowed on him the name that is above every name, so that at the name of Jesus, every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth, and under the earth, in every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father. So in Jesus, we see the perfect example of self sacrificial love. Jesus didn't think about his rights, he had the right to remain in heaven with God and enjoy full fellowship with Him, and enjoy the blessings of full deity. But instead, he decided to empty Himself to take on the limitations of human form, and to come in dwell in the flesh to identify with us and to give Himself as a sacrifice for our sins. He who did no sin, war, the penalty for all of our sins, because of his love, his self sacrificial love, and because of the joy that he found in what his death would accomplish, he was willing to endure that suffering. He was willing to just go through the shame in the The agony of the cross for us because of his self sacrificial love. And when we can have that same same type of love, then we're no longer thinking about how we can promote our interests, how we can get ahead. And if somebody mistreats us, you know, it's not the end of the world, because we're willing to sacrifice for others, we're willing to do what we can to honor Christ, and to show love for Him in love for others. In verse 17, we see that Paul adapted this attitude, chapter two, verse 17, he says, even if I'm to be poured out as a drink, offering, upon the sacrificial offering of your faith, I'm glad and rejoice with you all. So Paul says, I'm happy to be a sacrifice to if I need to be poured out as an offering to help build your faith, to help you help establish you in your loyalty to Christ, I'm happy to do that. And we see his son in the faith, Timothy also took on this attitude of not thinking about his own needs, but thinking about how he could serve others. In verse 19 of chapter two. Paul says, I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you soon, so that I too, may be cheered by news of you, for I have no one like him, who will genuinely be concerned for your welfare. For they all seek their own interests, not those of Jesus Christ. But you know, Timothy is proven worth how is a son with a father, he is served with me in the Gospel, I hope, therefore, to send him just as soon as I see how it will go with me. And I trust in the Lord that shortly I myself will come also. So Timothy had picked up this vision of self sacrificial from his Lord, and from his father in the faith, Paul. And Jesus teaches us that that's the way to greatness in the kingdom as well. In Matthew 20, you remember, the mother, the wife of Zebedee came and asked Jesus to allow our sons James and John, to be seated one at the right hand, one at the left hand of Jesus, when he came in his kingdom, she wanted them to have the prominence the place of honor beside Jesus. But Jesus responded to that request and said, That's not the way it works in my kingdom, in Matthew 20,

Unknown Speaker  22:28
starting in verse 25. But Jesus called them to him and said, you know that the rulers of the Gentiles lord it over them, and they're great ones exercise authority over them, it shall not be so among you. But whoever would be great among you must be your servant. And whoever would be first among you must be your slave, even as the Son of Man came not to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many. Jesus came in this world to serve us to provide the sacrifice that we needed for our sins. And if we want to be His disciples, we will have that attitude as well. We will look for ways that we can serve, and we can help build others up in their faith in Christ. And then the final secret I would like to suggest that Paul learn for enduring suffering was he cultivated an attitude of thankfulness and joy. So back in Philippians, let's look at chapter one, verses three through five. Philippians, one, three through five, Paul says, I think my God, in all my remembrance of you, always in every prayer of mine for you all, making my prayer with joy, because of your partnership in the Gospel from the first day until now, when Paul prayed for his brethren and thought about them, he was thankful. He remembered how these Philippians in particular had partnered with him in the Gospel for a long time. They had supported his work for many years. And he was thankful to them and thankful for them, because they were willing to share with him in the Gospel, and help provide his knees so that he could take the Gospel to various places throughout the world. And as he made these prayers, He was joyful. He rejoiced at what they were able to accomplish together in spreading the gospel in teaching others about Christ. And then let's look down at verses 29 and 30, of chapter one. He says here, for it has been granted to you for the sake of Christ, you should not only believe in him, but also suffer for his sake, engaged in the same conflict that you saw I had, and now here that I still have when he says it has been granted to you. That's the verb form of the word war of the word grace. So what Paul is saying in a paraphrase is that you've graciously been granted the privilege of suffering for Christ. So he viewed suffering for Christ as a gift. This was a gift from God. Rather than being a curse, it's actually a gift. And there's good that can come from our willingness to endure suffering for Christ. And so thinking of it that way, makes it easier to bear, recognizing the good that can come from our sufferings, even even you know, when at times, we may not be able to see that but trusting that God can make good come from it. In Philippians, chapter two, verses 14 through 16, we see something that can cause us can can take away our attitude of thankfulness and joy that we have to be on guard against Philippians 214. He says, do all things without grumbling or questioning, that you may be blameless and innocent children of God without blemish in the midst of a crooked and twisted generation, among whom you shine his lights in the world, holding fast to the word of life, so that in the day of Christ, I may be proud that I did not run in vain or labor in vain. So what's our natural tendency when we face difficulty when we face suffering? Why is this happening to me? Why am I having to face this? We want to grumble, we want to question why is God doing this to me? Why is he allowing this to happen? But we have to guard against those attitudes. Those are thoughts that come from the devil. He wants to get us focused on the negative and questioning God. But instead, if we can remember that even our sufferings are gifts from God, and there's good that can come from it, then we can cultivate that attitude of thankfulness and joy, rather than grumbling and questioning

Unknown Speaker  27:03
it over in chapter four. We see the things that we can do to help us keep this type of attitude. Starting in verse four, Philippians four, Rejoice in the Lord always. Again, I will say rejoice. Let your reasonably reasonable Ness be known to everyone. The Lord is at hand. Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God, in the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus. So we need to rejoice in everything. Even when we're facing sufferings and trials, there are still blessings from God. God pours His mercies upon us each day. And if we'll open our eyes and see them, there's always something for which we can be thankful, always something in which we can rejoice in. So if we'll focus on that, it will help us in our struggles in our trials, in when we're tempted to be anxious about our trials, well, we need to take those requests. Take those thoughts to the Lord in prayer. Do not be anxious about them, but in everything by prayer, and thanks in supplication with thanksgiving, we let our requests be made known to God, we take our concerns, our anxious thoughts to him, and ask him to help us, help us to be strong with his suffering, help us to trust in Him, and lean upon him. And remember to be thankful for the blessings that He does give us. And when we do that, then his peace will guard our hearts and minds. It will stay in guard as a soldier to protect us when Satan sins, those thoughts of grumbling. Those thoughts of questioning those thoughts of doubt, those thoughts of anxiety, his peace can protect us and can see us through the storms that we face in our lives in to help us in cultivating that peace that thankfulness that joy. We need to keep a watch on our thoughts. What is it that we allow our minds to dwell on? In verses eight and nine he says, Finally, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is just, whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is commendable. If there's any excellence. If there's anything worthy of praise, think about these things. What you have learned and received and heard and seen in me, practice these things, and the God of peace will be with you. So if we want God's peace to surround us want God to be with us, we need to keep our minds focused on these His type of thoughts, think about what's true, what's honorable, what's just what's pure, what's lovely, what's commendable? What's excellent and worthy of praise. And we need to recognize when others do things that help us. Paul did that he recognized the Philippians for what they had done in sending this gift to them. Starting in verse 14 and chapter four, he says, it was kind of you to share my trouble. In you Philippians yourselves know that in the beginning of the gospel, when I left Macedonia, no church entered into partnership with me in giving and receiving, except you only, even in Thessalonica, you sent help, to me help for my needs, once and again, not that I seek the gift, but I seek the fruit that increases to your credit, I have received full payment and more I'm well supplied, having received from a Pafford itis the gifts you sent a fragrant offering a sacrifice acceptable and pleasing to God. And my God will supply every need of yours, according to his riches and glory. In Christ Jesus, to our God and Father be glory forever and ever. Amen. Paul took the time to let the Philippians know that he appreciated what they were doing, that they wanted to share in his trouble in his sufferings while he was there in prison, and that he was thankful that from the beginning of the time that he left Philippi, right after establishing the church there, they had been supportive of him. They sent gifts to Him time and time again, to help him in his work in preaching the gospel. And so he wanted to express that things. And we too need to remember to express things when people do something to help us when they share with us when we're going through those difficult times. Take time to thank them, and to cultivate that attitude of thankfulness and joy.

Unknown Speaker  32:03
Paul reminded his son in the faith Timothy in Second Timothy 312, that persecution difficulties is something we should expect in the Christian life. In Second Timothy 312. Paul says, Indeed, all who desire to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be persecuted. So we can expect to face trouble difficulty in this life. Jesus also warned His disciples right before he went to the cross, that they should expect some suffering in John 15, is he's having that final discourse with His disciples. He tells them that John 15, starting in verse 18. If the world hates, you know that it has hated me before it hated you, if you were of the world, the world would love you as its own, but because you are not of the world, but I chose you out of the world, therefore the world hates you. Remember the word that I said to you, a servant is not greater than his master. If they persecuted the, they will also persecute you. If they kept my word, they will also keep yours. Jesus was perfect, he did no sin. But there were people who rejected him and persecuted him and put him to death. So we as his followers, who follow him imperfectly, and in you know, don't always do things perfectly we, we should recognize that we too may face persecution, we will face difficulties trials in lives. So that should not surprise us. But if we keep in mind these principles that we see revealed in the letter of the Philippians, I think it can help us in dealing with a suffering. Remember that God's at work in our lives, when we're striving to follow Him and be His children. Remember that knowing Christ and serving Him, living for Him, should be the top priority in our life, when that's the case that will make the suffering seem less troublesome. When we look at the self sacrificing example of Christ, that gives us strength for being willing to suffer for the sake of others. And when we cultivate an attitude of thankfulness and joy, that can help us keep the proper perspective on suffering. So I hope that thinking about these things will be helpful to you and helpful to each of us as we face trials and difficulties in our lives. If we can put these in practice, I think it can help us have the perspective that Paul had on suffering in second Corinthians chapter four, verses 16 through 18. He says, so we do not lose heart, though our outer self is wasting away, our inner self is being renewed day by day. For this light, momentary affliction is preparing for us an eternal weight of glory beyond all comparison, as we look not to the things that are seen, but to the things that are unseen, for the things that are seen are transient, but the things that are unseen, are eternal. Remember the list that Paul that we read about the sufferings Paul went through, if we're focused just on this life, I think we would be very hard pressed to say, those were like momentary afflictions, he went through some pretty intense suffering, but he viewed them in light of eternity. And so in light of eternity, this life is just a blip. You know, it's, it's hardly anything compared to eternity in heaven. And so if we can keep that perspective, then our trials and our sufferings, will remember, you know, these are just like momentary afflictions. And God can bring good out of it, if we trust in Him, and lean upon him. So I hope this was, will be helpful to each of us as we think about this.

Unknown Speaker  36:21
But to enjoy the full blessings of that hope. For an eternal home with Christ, we have to be a part of his people, and part of his family, we need to be his followers. And to become a follower of Christ, we need to be willing to confess our faith that Jesus is that Promised Messiah, the Son of God, who came to this earth, in born in his body, the penalty for our sins, that we might receive forgiveness. And we need to be willing to turn away from our sins, to repent of them, and instead allow Jesus to be Lord of our life, to submit to His waves. And we need to be united with Him in baptism, where we go through that picture of His death, burial and resurrection, so that we can come in contact with the saving benefits of his sacrifice for us. If you haven't done that in the past, I would encourage you to think about that. Think about making that commitment tonight and starting your walk with him. Or perhaps you have become a Christian in the past, but knowing Christ and living for Him has not been the top priority in your life. You've let persecutions or let cares of this world choke that out, and it's no longer first place in your life. If we can help you and encourage you, pray for you and with you, and help you get your life right. If there's anything we can do to help you please come as we say in and say
