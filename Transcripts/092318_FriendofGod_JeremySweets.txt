Good morning. It's good to see everyone here today. It's a little rainy and dreary outside. But any day we can come together and worship God, it's a good day. So I'm glad that we could be here. We're glad that we can pray together, singing together, glad that we can all take the Lord's Supper and remember, really the greatest event in human history. I'm glad that you're here to worship with us today with me. If you would open your Bibles to James chapter two, James chapter two.

Jeremy Sweets  00:38
Read with me, if you would, verses 20 through 24. James 223 24. Do you want to be shown you foolish person, that faith apart from works is useless? Was not Abraham our father justified by works when he offered up Isaac his son on the altar? You see that faith was active along with his works and faith was completed by his works. And the scripture was fulfilled. It says Abraham believed God and it was counted to him as righteousness. And he was called a friend of God, you see that a person is justified by works and not by faith alone. Here there's a question about whether faith and inactive faith is sufficient. Is that enough to simply a sit or say that you believe without your actions completing and following that up. And James points to Abraham is one that believed and allowed his belief to push his actions or direct his actions, so that he combined both faith and works. There's one phrase in this passage, though, that really caught my attention. And that's found in verse 23. After it says the scripture was fulfilled, and Abraham believed God and was counted to him as righteousness, it states and he was called a friend of God, a friend of God, I'd like to talk for just a few moments about being a friend of God, what an amazing statement, as far as I'm aware, that's not stated with that kind of language about any other person. Now, this does borrow from Second Chronicles 20 And verse seven. And also Isaiah 41, eight that references Abraham, as a friend of God, and he was a friend of God we can see from from this passage and elsewhere in Scripture because of his faith, because of his obedience, because of his trust. In God. Abraham was a friend of God. As I think about that phrase, really, when we think about friendship with God, what an amazing thing that is, we have lots of friend today, but there's nothing no friendship more important than being a friend with God. And friendship with God is not dependent upon God in terms of God may or may not God has done so much for us. He has extended kindness and friendship to all people. Really, the question is whether we would be a friend to God. And so that's what I want to ask you and think about and what ways do we relate to friends, I think we can see in Abraham and elsewhere in Scripture, that that's the way that we are to relate to God and consider God. So let us notice some points about being a friend of God. How can we be a friend of God? Well, the first thing that comes to my mind is regular communication. Regular communication.

Jeremy Sweets  03:49
Friendships are strengthened, and they grow when regular communication takes place. That's true in regular friendships. That's true in marriage. In fact, in pre marital counseling, one of the things we'll often talk to people about is communication. Make sure that communication is healthy and strong and occurring on a regular basis. Friends seek each other out, and I want to talk to one another, and they talk to each other about the routine, and the special, they talk to each other about their problems, about their struggles, about the occurrences that they encounter. When we look at God, we see that God has communicated to us and Hebrews one verses one through three, says long ago at many times, and in many ways God spoke to our fathers by the prophets, but in these last days, he has spoken to us by his Son, we see that God has revealed himself in the past, and even in a clearer way has revealed himself today, through or by or in His Son, Jesus Christ. But the point we see is that God has spoken to us. We're not left to guess Ever wonder about who this God is? We are told who he is. And we can learn much from how he has communicated to us. But not only has he spoken to us, but that's only part of it, isn't it? You know, sometimes I find myself talking. And we have four kids, there's a lot of hustle and bustle, there's a lot of competing for talk time with four kids. And sometimes I feel like people aren't listening. Especially if we're all talking at the same time. Maybe I'm not listening if we're all trying to talk at the same time. So part of communication is not only the talking part, but the listening. God has spoken to us and we need to listen. We need to be like a little boy Samuel in First Samuel 310, when God called his name Samuel, Samuel, he said, Speak for your servant here. We need to be eager to hear God. And Psalm 37, verses four through five it says, Make me know your ways, oh, Lord, teach me your paths. Lead me in your truth and teach me for you are the God of my salvation. For you. I wait all day long. You see in the psalmist here and eagerness to hear God's word, desire, a need even to hear God's were, friends regularly communicate. And we need to be people that listen to God. That's what Abraham did that. When God sent him from his homeland, he went, because he listened to God, when God says, Take your son, your only son, the son of promise that you've been waiting for for 25 years and offer him up. Abraham listened to God. We need to be a people that listen. In fact, that's an essential component of discipleship. Jesus said in John 10, verse 27, My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow Me. My sheep know my voice. Not only do we need to listen to God, but God also wants us to talk with him. In First Thessalonians five, verse 17, it says, Pray without ceasing. And that's what friends do, don't they? They talk to one another, on a regular basis, without ceasing. And so it is with God, we are to be people that regularly pray. We see that day Daniel made a habit of prayer. So that three times a day he prayed to God, do you have a habit of prayer? Do you pray to God on a regular basis, on an ongoing basis, a similar statements found in Ephesians, six verses 17 and 18. There it talks about the the armor that we're to put on as we face Satan, and it says in take the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God, praying at all times in the spirits, with all prayer and supplication. And notice both components there of communication are found in the armor of Ephesians six, it says, take the sword of the Spirit, which is the word of God take that with you. Understand, read, listen to God's communication to you, but also praying at all times in the Spirit. When I think about friends, I think about regular communication.

Jeremy Sweets  08:42
Abraham talked with God, and he listened to God, what about you? Are you talking to God? And are you listening to God? Regular communication? Well, how else can we be a friend of God? I believe we can be a friend of God, through honesty, honesty. True friends are honest with one another. Proverbs 27, verses five and six says better is open rebuke, than hidden love. Faithful are the wounds of a friend profuse, or the kisses of an enemy. It's better to be honest with one another, to help the other rather than to be fake and, and smooth things over when harm would actually result. When we think about God, we see that God has always been honest. He has always been truthful, in fact, that defines his very character. In Titus one and verse two, and also in Hebrews six and 18. It says that God never lies. And you can underscore that God never lies. He's truthful. He's truthful. He speaks truth. and John 17 In verse 17, as Jesus prayed to God about unity, he says, Sanctify them in the truth. Thy were, Your word is truth. And we can count on that. God has always been honest. But what about us? Are we honest with God? Proverbs 11 in three states, the integrity of the upright guides them, but the unfaithful are destroyed by their duplicity. That's the NIV the integrity of the upright guides them, but the unfaithful are destroyed by their duplicity. You know, we live this life with so much pretension. It's not a word we often use, but pretense means an attempt to make something that is not the case appear true. If you ever noticed that, we are full of this pretension. We want to make things look good, we want to put our best foot forward, we want people to think well of us. We want to be respected and appreciated. But often in our quest for adoration and respect from others, we sacrifice authenticity being real, and maybe even honesty. If we go to that extent, we don't want to appear like we have ever messed up in this life. We don't want to appear like we have problems. We don't want to ask for help, or appear like we have some kind of deficiency. We want people to think well of us we we mask, or hide those kinds of issues. Not only that, but there are social conventions that keep our conversations and our actions neat and tidy with each other. There are certain questions that you simply don't ask in public, there are certain statements, beliefs that you simply don't say, in public. Those are things that you don't say out loud. In other words, we have a very strong filter, when it comes to dealing with most people don't, we have a strong filter. Now, I do believe that we need to be more real and authentic, really, with more people. We shouldn't have this mask. I'm not saying we need to ignore every social convention. Some of those are around for for good reason. But really, in part, I say all this to say that when you're with a friend, friends are honest with one another, they're authentic with one another. And often with our friends, we remove much of that filter, notice. That's the kind of communication and the kind of hearts that we need to have with God. If we're to be a friend of God, we must be humble and honest and authentic and real. We need to lose that filter that we carry around with us so much. Sometimes we filter for so long, we begin to believe things ourselves. Often we can't even be real and authentic with our own heart. If we're to be a friend of God, though, we must lose that filter and present ourselves naked as it were vulnerable before God.

Jeremy Sweets  13:34
You know, you can see the brutal honesty, an unfiltered nature of children can't. Often you're trying to quick to hush them we don't. We know you're not supposed to say that kids will simply say and talk without a filter. And Matthew 18 and verses three and four. It says Truly I say to you unless you turn and become like children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven. whoever humbles himself like this child is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven. And there's a lot that that could mean primarily he's talking about humility as he points that out. But what goes along with that humility is an honesty, isn't it? Authenticity. We need to be honest with God, about our sins, about our faults. More often in this society if someone is accused of wrongdoing the first thing they say is it wasn't me or they begin to spin things. There's a reason why I did this very few times do we see someone accused of something and they simply say I did it and I was absolutely wrong. Period. Not just people in society what about us? We spin we deny we we want it to look the best possible way. We're more concerned with how we appear rather than The truth whether when rather than being honest with ourselves, we fear what others think we fear how people will respond, we fear that we're going to get in trouble or we're going to bear consequences. In first, John Warner verse nine, it says, If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. That's hard to do, isn't it? confess our sins, like I mentioned, we often hide those sins, even from ourselves. In Alcoholics Anonymous, one of the first things that they do is, you have to be honest, you have to admit who you are. Hi, I'm so and so. And I'm an alcoholic, that is a huge step in their progress and dealing with their subject to simply admit to themselves and to other people who they are. We need that same kind of on authenticity. You know, we don't hear people say, out loud, in polite company, I'm an alcoholic. We don't hear people say, I'm a thief. I'm a liar. I'm addicted to pornography. I'm hateful. I mean, we don't we don't say that. But when we come before God, we have to remove our filter, we have to remove this, this hiding this shielding so that we present the best possible, right, and we have to be real with God. We have to confess our sins who we are. And the funny thing, probably not the right word is God already knows who we are. with other people, we might think we can hide some of those things. But God already knows we need to confess our sins before him. Not only that, but we put our best foot forward when it comes to our needs. We don't want to look vulnerable, vulnerable, we don't want to look like we have any problems at all. But when it comes to God, we have to be brutally honest. We come before him. He created us, He knows us. In first Peter five and verse seven, says Casting all your anxieties on Him because He cares for you. Giving up your struggles, your worries, and your problems. We can express the God our true needs our true self. We can say to God, I have a brand new dad. And I have no idea what I'm doing. I'm scared to death. You know, we don't tell that to other people. It may be that may be that you're saying I have to care for my dad and my old age. And I'm scared to death. I have no idea what I'm doing. It may be that you're saying I have a brand new job. I'm going to a new school. I'm scared. I'm frightened. We don't say that out loud. But we can show our true and honest hearts to God.

Jeremy Sweets  18:27
It may be that you need to say I'm weak and frail. Because what human can boast before God, what human can stand up and say I've got it all together. I have all the strength I need and I don't need you. Only an ignorant person can say that and unaware person would even pretend to make that kind of statement. But with God, we can be honest and we have to be, we need to be. That's what friends do. That's what friends do. And if we were to be a friend of God, and we need to be honest, we need to be honest. You also need to be faithful. A friend is someone who is loyal or faithful, consistent. They're gonna be there. You know, we hear about the so called friends of the prodigal son. He had a lot of friends when he had money. But when his money ran out, his so called friends left now they we all know they were not true friends. A True Fit friend will be with you through thick and thin in good times and bad. Proverbs 17 And verse 17 says A friend loves at all times and a brother is born for adversity. In Proverbs 18 And verse 24. It says, A man of many companions may come to ruin but there is a friend who sticks closer than and a brother faithfulness that defines friendship, doesn't it? We see that God has always shown himself to be faithful. This deserves a whole series of lessons if you're to scan the Scripture and what it says about this subject, a few selections in Psalm 33 And verse four, for the word of the Lord is upright and all his work is done in faithfulness. Psalm 3119 In verse 90, Your faithfulness and yours to all generations, you have established the earth and it stands fast. God God's faithfulness can particularly be seen when we are in trouble when we are struggling. In Deuteronomy 31. In verse six, we see that the commission was given to the children of Israel, Be strong and courageous, do not fear of being dread of them, for it is the Lord your God who goes with you, He will not leave you or forsake you. God is consistent. God is faithful. He is not wishy washy. It is faithfulness is not altered by circumstances or dependent upon other people. In first Corinthians 10, and verse 13, as we face our struggles, and temptations with sin, it says No temptation has overtaken you, but it's common to man. But it's common to man, God is faithful. And he will not allow you to be tempted beyond what you are able but with the temptation will provide a way of escape, that you may be able to endure it. God is faithful. He's consistent. He's loyal to us. So God, God is faithful. There's a lot more we could say about that. But the question for us is, Are we faithful to God? Are we loyal to God? Now, God doesn't need our help. In the same way, we can't be there for God when, when he's struggling, he simply doesn't struggle. But that need for faithfulness is still present. It is still there. And we need to be faithful to him and all things. And Hebrews 10 And verse 23. It says, Let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering, for He who promised is faithful when we see God's faithfulness, it should encourage us to be faithful, to be consistent, and to hold fast the confession of our hope to hold it fast. In first Corinthians four and verse two really a verse that we've been using for much of a theme this year, being faithful stewards. There it says, Moreover, it is required as students stewards that they be found faithful, it's not enough to be a steward of God or be commissioned. You need to also be faithful in what you're doing. carry out the task. Faithfulness also means that we remain true through persecution and difficulty, we remain true to God. Through our struggles, we remain true to God no matter what

Jeremy Sweets  23:24
the parable of the soils talks about thorns that will choke out the word. It talks about rocky ground that doesn't have the right kind of soil to produce. A lot of times we'll spurred up with energy. But when the cares of the world come or when persecution comes, and we fall away, but to be faithful to be a true friend of God, that means that we will be faithful through thick and thin. In Matthew 10, and verse 22, it says, and you will be hated by all for my name's sake. But the one who endures the end will be say, Revelation two in verse 10, as we read about people that were persecuted the martyrs that were before the altar, the crying out to God says, Be faithful under death, and I will give you the crown of life. And there's two ways that we can take that and really both are true. Even to the extent of giving our own life we need to be faithful. If we're threatened with choosing God, or choosing safety, we choose God. If we're threatened with choosing God or choosing life, we choose God. It may be we won't face that kind of decision. And we'll need to be faithful each and every day up until death and that's also true. We need to remain faithful to God. Our faithfulness will be rewarded by a faithful God who keeps His word. In first Corinthians 15 And verse 58. It says, Therefore, my beloved brothers be said Fast, unmovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that in the Lord your labor is not in vain. We need to be a faithful people loyal. That's what friends do. And if we're to be a friend of God, we need to be faithful as well. are probably the one word that really defines friendship more than anything is love. Love. It's the chief and defining characteristic of a friendship. We see in Proverbs 17, verse 17, a passage we read earlier, but it says A friend loves at all times. In fact, we see some good friendships, some great friendships and scripture, none better than David and Jonathan. And that's the language that it uses of David and Jonathan that they loved one another. They were concerned for one another, they were trying to put the other one above themselves, they sacrifice for the other, they loved one another. A true friend has the other's best interest at hearts, at heart, hearts. Friends do what is best for the other, not what is merely convenience. They'll even sacrifice themselves, their own wants and their own desires. And when we consider God, we see that God has shown himself to be a friend to us in spades to if degree in a tremendous way. First of all, we see in first round four and verse eight, that God is love. It is his character. And we see that coming out from God in so many ways. In Psalm 86 And verse 15, it says, But You oh Lord, our God, merciful and gracious, slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love and faithfulness. First, John four verses nine through 10. And this the love of God was made manifest among us that God sent His only Son into the world, so that we might live through Him. And this is love not that we have loved God, but that He loved us and sent His Son to be the propitiation for our sins. If you want to know what love is, you'll look to the sacrifice of Jesus Christ, who was sent here by his loving Father, for us. Romans five eight says it very succinctly, but God shows His love for us and that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us. That is love. So God has shown us tremendous amount of love. The question is, what are we showing to God? Are we being a friend of God? This is really the first commandment.

Jeremy Sweets  27:52
In Matthew 22, the question was asked, what is the first commandment and Jesus answered, without hesitation, you shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul, and with all your mind, he was quoting from from Deuteronomy, chapter four, from chapter six. And so we see that that's a statement that's made often in the Old Testament of loving God with our entire being. And if we're gonna be a friend of God, then we need to have that kind of love. The kind of love we see in God is a sacrificial love. And that's the same kind of love that we need to have for God, and for others, we put God's interests above our own. We care for others more than we care for ourselves. In fact, we imitate the very love of God that He has shown to us in Galatians chapter two and verse 20, Paul could make the statement, I have been crucified with Christ, and is no longer I who live but Christ, who lives in me, and the why life I now live in the flesh, I live by faith in the Son of God who loved me, and gave himself for me. What could make a sane person say that I am crucifying myself? I'm putting myself to a torturous death. What could make someone say that? Well, Paul could say that because he had looked to Jesus Christ and His great sacrifice. And he knew that he could sacrifice himself as well. It's no longer what I want. It's no longer about me. But I live with faith in God. In John 14 and verse 15, it says, If we love God will do what He commands. It said, If you love me, you will keep My commandments. So to love God is to act. Its to do what he says to do what he wants to do what He desires, rather than what we want. me close with a passage from John chapter 15 In verses 12 through 15, you're welcome to open to that with me if you would, John 15. Starting in verse 12. Notice what Jesus says about our relationship together. John 15 and verse 12. This is my commandment that you love one another, as I have loved you. Greater love has no one than this, that someone lay down his life for his friends, you are my friends, if you do what I command you. No longer do I call you servants, for the servant does not know as maddest Master is doing. But I have called you friends, for all that I have heard from my Father I have made known to you. Notice that we see that Jesus says, just as I have loved you, I want you to love others. We see also that Jesus demonstrated the greatest love that could be shown. Greater love has no one than this, that one lay down his life for his friends. That's what Jesus did. He laid down his life for his friends. But notice, it's interesting how he says that he wants the relationship to be he says, I want to consider you friends and not serve. And what he means by that is not blindly led servants servants act out of duty. They do what they're told simply because they're told, just do this. But he says, but I've revealed to you the mind of God, I've given you a why I've given you a reason I've shown to you God's heart. You're not a blind servant. Now we see elsewhere. We are to be servants, but not blindly lead servants. We're friends, and can be friends with God. Because he has told us about his heart. He has told us what He wants us to know he's revealed to us. And so we can be friends with God. Are you a friend of God? Do you regularly communicate with him? Do you practice honesty, faithfulness and love? Do you direct that toward God? It's not an easy thing to be a friend sometimes is it?

Jeremy Sweets  32:14
But it's worth it. It's worth it. Maybe there's someone here this morning that's not a Christian, you're not a friend of God. You've not committed yourself to Him, believing that Jesus is the Christ repenting of your sins, being honest, confessing your sins before God, repenting and turning away from that sin and being baptized in the water for the forgiveness of your sins. If you've not done that, then you're not truly a friend of God the way He wants. Listen to Him, submit to Him. If you're here this morning and you are a Christian and you're not living as you should then rededicate yourself. Show yourself again to be the friend that you committed yourself to be when you were baptized. There's any subject to the invitation. Please come as we stand in scene at this time.
