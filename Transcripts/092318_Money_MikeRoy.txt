It's always a great privilege for us together and in God's presence, to praise him to honor him to glorify Him and thank Him for all that he has done for us. We do that on a regular basis, I think it's fitting to do so. And through the process of worship and teaching and preaching, we've become transformed a little bit each time to become more and more like our God, always want to think about practical lessons that we can bring to each of us as we seek to face the challenges that each of us face in our lives, no matter how much money you make, or how great your salary might be, or how feeble it might be, at times, all of us face

Mike Roy  00:47
some strain financial strain at different times in our lives. And it'd be nice to think that having become a Christian, there would be no financial worries or concerns are cared but that's just not the case. And so, this evening, I want to address the issue, how do we deal with our lives when, when we're on a tight budget when there is a financial strain in our lives this past week or so Gary Fisher, preached from the book of Revelation that the very encouraging to me I trusted it was for all of us. But one of the numbers that comes up there is the number seven, seven represents the perfect number. And so this evening, I thought I talked with you about the seven keys to trusting God when money is tight. And so just want to make this a practical lesson for each of us. As we face the challenges in our lives, we all do it different times. But there's some principles in Scripture. And these things are not original with me. But there are principles that God has given to us in Scripture, that helps us to get a perspective, when we're facing financial strain. Maybe it might be that you've not had that recently. Or it may come at some point in your life. But the reality is, sooner or later, almost everybody faces financial strain, and some of the anxiety that might go with that. So I want to talk with you this evening about some keys to trusting God, when your finances are up in the air or down in the trenches, so to speak. And so let's look at those this evening. The first thing I want to suggest to you to each one of us, when we talk about financial challenges and the strain that can come with that, in the midst of the financial crisis, the challenge that we're facing, I think we need to understand that it's not about the money. So many times we think about, you know, why am I struggling with paying the bills? Or why are we going through such a financial hardship right now? The truth is, we all do from time to time. And so I think we need to recognize that principle I want to suggest to at the beginning of this lesson, that life is a test. That's what life is really about. It's not about making money. It's not about losing your money. It's not about how wealthy you are, or how poor you are anywhere in between on that that continuum. But life is a test. And God wants to know How are we going to respond when adversity comes into our lives? And if it's financial adversity? How do we respond to that situation, because so often, we live our lives through the lens of the dollar. And I see neighbors and friends and church members that maybe have nice homes and drive nice cars, and they seem like they're very well off. And that becomes a standard of my thinking. But that's not not, that's not the reality of the world that we live in. And so again, I think God is helping us in trying to help us see that life is a test of our faith and our trust in Him. So we need to recognize that. And really, it's about choosing to trust the grace, power and Providence of a loving father. So when we're especially in the middle of a financial crisis, or constrained by low income, or whatever it might be that you're dealing with, or I might be dealing with or have dealt with at times. Really what what life is about is choosing to trust God's grace, choosing to trust His power, His providence, because He is a loving father and he cares for for you and me for each one of us. So many times we lose sight of that in the midst of financial challenges. And you know, we're so thankful to have so many babies here young children, there's some we're 5055 children, but it's expensive having children isn't it and sometimes you get kind of conservative hospital bills come in and hoping that your your health insurance pays most of that or some of that. But but the reality is we still trust God's grace and power to meet all the needs that we have. So really, when it comes to if there's financial strain in your life, and and and the money is tight If that's right now or has been, or maybe will be in the future. So either we trust God, we trust ourselves kind of comes down to that. Because if I, if and when I, when I can't figure out how we're going to pay the bills, or where the money's gonna come from tuition, or having a baby or buying a house, whatever it might be, either we trust God, but we trust ourselves. And I think it's a whole lot better if we trust God, because trusting myself, usually is not the way to go. So that's the first thing I want to point out a friend, I want to share a quotation from this author of this article. And the author said, our financial stability depends on how much we trust God rather than on how much we make. It's really not about the money, how hard you work, and how wisely we've invested. Our financial situation is almost always about trust. But when we're when we're in the midst of that financial constraint, it's like, why, why me? Why us? Why are we going through the hawk, I'm gonna have more money in the bank, how come I can't pay my bills, God's saying, I know what's going on in your life. Look at me. So I think that this first point is helpful. When we're in the middle of that, that financial constraint and the strain on our lives, neither understand it's not really about the money. Secondly, when I suggest that God challenges us to trust him with today,

Mike Roy  06:26
that is a huge task. Because I'm living in a future where am I going to be two weeks to two years, 20 years from now? What about retirement, all the stuff that we think about that kind of weaves through our mind. But God says Don't Don't go there. Yes, we make plans for the future. We're like the aunt, we work hard, we make provision for the future. But we don't live our lives out there in the advanced we trust God by living one day at a time. But if there's some teachings in Matthew chapter six and verse 25 329, we'll put these on the screen as well. Feel free to look at those in the Bible if you'd like to. But look at Matthew chapter six. And this is well known teaching and again, but the one of the messages that messages that Jesus is teaching here is that he wants us to trust God, to meet our needs on a day by day basis to live our lives one day at a time. So your verse 29, verse 25, Jesus said, Therefore I tell you do not be anxious about your life, what you will eat, or what you will drink, nor about your body, what you will put on. Now look at this phrase I've highlighted in verse 25. Is not life more than food, and the body more than clothing? So tell me, is the summation of your life, the clothing that you wear, the designer shoes that you've got? Is that what life's about? The food that we eat? If it's just really nice, rich food? Is that what life is all about? And Jesus is implying no life is not just about your clothing, about your dress that you were not about your shoes. Then he says, Look in verse 26, look at the birds of the air They neither sow nor reap, nor gather into barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them, then Jesus, racist is very obvious, rhetorical question, but we have to ask it. Because we have trouble trusting the power of God, the grace of God, the love of God, in His providence in our lives. So then Jesus says, Are you not of more value than they stop and think they sound like the birds of the air? You get some sparrows and some Robins and blackbirds in your backyard. And Jesus is saying, aren't you more valuable than a bird? Aren't you more value than the possum? Aren't you more value than a raccoon? Surely we understand that Jesus said that we are of greater value of into into infinite value in comparison to

Mike Roy  09:08
his creation. He's driving, he's trying to convey that to each one of us. Then he goes on to say in which of you, by being anxious can add a single hour to his span of life? Maybe he's saying, if we thought we could just if I had enough physical energy and mental energy, I could work harder work a second job, or a third job, do some moonlight work, if I just had enough time, like I just expand the hours of the day past 24 hours, I can make more money, we can pay our bills. And Jesus is saying that by being anxious or in our mindset, we can't accomplish those things. He said, Why are you anxious about your clothing? And said consider the lilies of the field how they grow. They neither toil nor they spin and then in verse 29, he said Yeah, and I tell you, even Solomon, in all his glory was not arrayed. Like one of the He's. So you think about what he's saying there. Solomon was a man of incredible wealth, incredible power, luxury. But Solomon in his heyday, with all of that affluence, with all of the clothing and the purple and everything that graced his life and his Palin's, his palace, didn't compare to a lily out in the field. A lily is more well dressed, and then Solomon was. And so Jesus is telling us that He wants us to trust him go on to the second part of this text over here in verse 30, excuse me, Jesus said, But if God so clothes, the grass of the field, which today is alive, and tomorrow is thrown into the oven, really not much more clothe you, O you of little faith, Therefore do not be anxious, saying, What shall we eat? Or what shall we drink? Or what shall we wear for the Gentiles seek after all these things. And then the next part of that verse, Jesus said, in your heavenly Father knows that you need them all. Jeremy talks about that, that idea, this one that God knows that years ago, for that priest in Birmingham, I did a couple of lessons on this principle, don't you think God knows. God knows your needs, he knows when your finances are tight. He knows when it's hard to pay the bill. He knows all of that. And he's telling us to trust him. So in verse 33, But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness and all these things will be added to Therefore the conclusion of verse 34. Therefore, do not be anxious about what tomorrow we're talking about. accepting the challenge to trust God with today. It's so hard to do, because we're always thinking about what's going to happen tomorrow. So Jesus said, Don't be anxious about tomorrow. Tomorrow will be anxious for itself tomorrow will care for itself. So what are you saying over here is don't borrow tomorrow's troubles today? Tomorrow's gonna have enough challenges today has enough challenges, but to to live my life today, worrying about tomorrow? How am I gonna pay this bill? What's gonna happen next week, next month, next year, I'm borrowing future trouble, guess what?

Mike Roy  12:14
You might not make it to tomorrow, Jesus may come back and all our troubles are over. And so he's telling us don't live Don't live your life worrying about thinking about planning about tomorrow, because tomorrow is going to take care of itself. Then the last part of verse 34, sufficient for the day is its own trouble. The numeric and Standard Version says this, Each day has enough trouble of its own. So what Jesus is telling us is that he wants us to trust God with today. So when finances are difficult, and as a strain of paying the bills, and all that type of thing. You have to live in and day tight compartments one day at a time. And I think that's one of the things that can help us deal with the stress and the strain when money is tight. Because what happens when money is tight? What am I gonna do tomorrow? What am I do when a mortgage is due in two weeks? What am I in and we just start playing the scene in our mind, and we're living our lives down the road. And Jesus says, tomorrow has enough trouble just live one day at a time. And somebody said, and I paraphrase this of all the troubles great and small that we worry about, think about, the greatest of them never happened at all. How many times are we worrying about thinking about this might happen? What am I gonna do here and all the hypothetical situations that might happen? And they don't? More often than not, they don't happen. So it is such a futile process to be thinking and worrying and being anxious about tomorrow, when they those things might not even take place. So the second challenge is we talk about some keys to trust in God when money is tight. God challenges us to trust him with today, this is the only day that we have that that is given to us. Number three, I think what is also helpful when we're facing financial constraints. We need to remember how rich we really are and we can lose sight of that because we live in a materialistic world, we look at people that live in nice house and drive nice cars, and they seem to be so well off. Sort of like what asef is doing in Psalm chapter 73, Psalm 73. You know, the wicked is doing all this stuff, and they've just having hay day and making so much money. You hear him I'm a Christian, and I'm having a hard time paying my bills, and we forget who we are in Christ. We'll look at some of these verses in just a moment. Romans chapter eight, Revelation Chapter Three Ephesians chapter one, we might just make some reference to that. But notice some again we want we we counter the lies of Satan by the truth of God's word. That's how we overcome this world. That's how we overcome Satan in all his life. So Paul said in verse 14, in Romans chapter a for all of for all, who are led by the Spirit of God, are sons of God, For you did not receive the spirit of slavery to fall back into fear. But you have received the Spirit of adoption as sons, who are we, whether you have a lot of money and don't have a lot of my we are sons and daughters of God. And if so, he says, We've received the Spirit of adoption as sons, by whom we cry, Abba, Father, father. So one of the things to think about this may connect to some of the points I've made. We serve a narcissist, a powerful, Holy God in heaven, we serve a God who is my father, who cares about me, not some distant, powerful, isolated god, that's a million miles away, it has all power to change all of future or the future, but has no connection with me. So that's the message in the spirit of the anxiety into slavery to fall back into fear and all that stuff. He said, we've received because we're sons of God, we can say our bus of, say, a term of endearment of a father. In verse 16, the Spirit himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God. Now, look at over here, if children, then were heirs, so you're talking about how much money you don't have in your checkbook right now? Or how much you do have in there. Realize this, Paul said that we're a heirs. And I want you to think about this first phrase over here that I've highlighted, where heirs of God, what does it mean to be an heir of God? Well think about being an heir of your parents, your parents pass away, your parents pass away will inherit their state. For some of you, that'll be very, very good inheritance. For some of us, there won't be anything. That's all right. If your parents don't have a dime, that's all right. Because as children of God, we're heirs of God. What does that mean? It means that we inherit everything that belongs to God.

Mike Roy  17:08
Wow, that's a powerful inheritance, with your parents, leave your lot of money or nothing. Don't focus on that reality. Focus on me as that we are heirs of God. So all the praise, all the peace, all the comfort, all the joy, all the glory, all the honor, all the power that is resonant in God's home, and heaven is yours, forever. You're not going to get a better retirement anywhere, I just want to tell you that if you're looking around here, you're not going to find anything like that nothing. So we're heirs of God. Sound I have a lot of money in my wallet. Right now, man's having a hard time paying the bills. I understand been there and done that we know about that. But remember how rich you are when you die? You spend eternity as an air of the eternal God, have to think about that one for a minute. Not only that, he says and fellow heirs with Christ. So Christ inherits all things. He's the glorified son who did his father's will, and is given everything that his father promised and we are fellow heirs. With crisis. This kind of staggers the imagination, it really does. I'm thinking of the passage that Gary shared with us recently in our study of Revelation, remember the church that lay out to see that was so bad that Jesus was about to spit them out of his mouth. He's about to spit them out of his mouth, because of their indifference in their lukewarmness and all that type of sin. And He says, Repent, and those you know, whom I love, you know, I command to repent, verse 20, you said, Behold, I stand at the door and knock if anyone hears My voice and opens the door, I will commit to him and eat with him. And he with me, the one who conquers, again this every time I look at this first, it's a powerful thought, the one who conquers, I will grant him to sit with Me on My throne. I don't think you're going to sit on any earthly throne. But to receive this promise, to be a co heir with Christ, to sit with him in eternal glory, eternal power, one of the images in scripture that we rain, we reign with Christ forever. So when we're facing financial shortcomings in our life and shortfall, remember the truth of who you are in Christ and the eternal comfort and the everlasting wealth that awaits us in heaven such a compelling thought to think about and there's so many others Ephesians chapter one First Peter, chapter one talks about this inheritance that's undefiled and perishable will not fade away in All of the wealth that God wants to share with us. So, again, the is we focusing on some keys to trusting God, when your money is tight. Remember who you are, you're an heir of an eternal God and a co heir. With Christ better think about that every day, we do things, chances are that we check or somebody did we check our phone, we check the stock market, I want to see how the investments could have just gone up or down, we check all these things. But the thing that we need to check every day is not the stock market. But the book of life that has our name recorded in there. So the third point that we need to take away is that we need to realize how rich we really are. So the irony when we're facing financial shortfall and the strain that comes with that, one of the principles of Scripture, no matter how wealthy we are, or how poor we might be, we give it back to God. That's a principle that we find in Scripture. And again, is going along with our theme for this year, we need to remember that we're that we are managers and stewards of the money that God is entrusted with to us, we're not owners. So this has been we'll look at Luke chapter six in just a moment. were faithful stewards, Jeremy emphasis emphasize this morning, the idea that we're thankful we're faithful to what we've been entrusted with, right. And that's our challenge to be faithful with our time, our energy, our talents, the gifts that God has given to us. We've got to be faithful with him. But we're not to be faithful owners. were faithful managers. were faithful stewards, just not mine. The money in my wallet came from God. And ultimately, I have to give it back to him. And he wants me to

Mike Roy  21:50
share it with others. But there's the principle that we are faithful and a part of it a slogan, and our theme this year is that we are stewards. We're not owners. How many? How many acres you own Mike? Well, it's a little bit less than an acre, how many cars do you own all that? Well, they don't really belong. They're just on loan to us from God. And God wants us to make the most of what He has given to us. We're faithful stewards. So look at this passage. And Luke chapter six, and verses 37 and 38. Luke's account puts the warning about judging in this context, maybe gives us a little different perspective. In verse 37, he says, Do not judge and you will not be judged, do not condemn, and you will not be condemned, forgive and you will be forgiven. And then in verse 30, he says, Give, and it will be given to you. A good measure, pressed down, shaken together and running over will be poured into your lap For with the measure you use, it will be measured back to you. And then amazing that people, these Palestinian peasants in a first century that didn't have a lot, God says, Give, give it back, they don't make a lot of money. They don't have a lot of resources, many of them. But still, even in that context, we're challenged to give, the way that we break the power of greed is giving it giving away, we think if I can just save enough, if I can store it away and put it in my vault in my house, or my safe in my house, my CD in the bank, where the more we try to hoard it all together, thinking, if I can just grab enough of this stuff, and hold on to it, I'm going to be okay. And God says, Open your arms, give gift to others. And when you do that, what's the reward? That he's gonna give you a little bit back look at the language over there. We give in it will be given back to you this good measure pressed down, shaken together, running over as the picture of the harvester, we thought about the faithful stewards get this and unsure what the language is here. I'm not a harvester or farmer, but to get this sack of the wheat or whatever you gathered, and God keeps

Unknown Speaker  24:06
putting more and more and more and more in more and they can't even

Mike Roy  24:10
hold it. Right that is that's that's the message that God gives us. So that the the surprising one of the surprising keys to dealing with the concerns of the financial hardship or challenges that we face, give it back to God, even if it's a little bit Look at Luke chapter 21. I don't have this on the screen. But this is again, very compelling passage of scripture. Luke chapter 21. And the first few verses over here Jesus talks about the gift that the widow gave at the temple treasury. So Luke chapter 21. A and in verse beginning of verse one, as this is talking about Jesus, he said he looked up and saw the rich putting their gifts into the treasury. He saw a poor widow putting in two small copper coins. And he said Truly I say to you, this poor widow put in more than all of them, for they all out of their surplus put into the offering. But she out of her poverty, put in all that she had to live on. With this lady have some concerns about paying tomorrow's bills, I think she might have some apprehension about that. But her mindset was, I'm gonna give back to God, even if it's these two copper coins that I might have. And the others give out of their wealth, their luxury, and they're not making any type of sacrifice. So this surprising truth of scriptures, we deal with our money. And we're so concerned about it, we want to invest it wisely. And we all that type of thing. But we want to give it back to God. And we do that by helping others by generously giving us we do on the first day of the week here at Broadmoor, which allows us to support as we mentioned, from time to time, about 20 preachers in this country and around the world. That's noteworthy thing for us to do. And so again, we look at these keys to helping us deal when we're facing financial constraints, giving it back to God. Here's a couple other points I want to mention this evening with almost seven keys to trusting God seems a perfect number. So hopefully, this will be a perfect lesson not really, but it gives us some principles that we can take with us. So number five, embrace your financial challenge as an adventure of faith. Think about that. What happened, we face financial hardship, whether it's paying our bills, and as we get older, sometimes we face the challenges of taking care of parents or maybe siblings or whoever it might be. But here's one of the key that can help us to overcome the challenges that we face, sometimes with our finances, that we embrace it as an adventure of faith. Look at Philippians chapter four. And, and verses 15 through 20. And Philippians chapter four, I put this up in the New International Version, just to get a little bit of a different read there says basically the same thing but knows what Paul says about his, his, his needs. And he's taking the gospel to the Roman Empire, and a lot of uncertainty about where the money is going to come from. He said in verse 15, verse 15, moreover, as you Philippians know, in the early days of our of your acquaintance with the gospel, when I set out for Macedonia, not one church shared with me in a matter of giving and receiving except you only for even when I was in Thessalonica, you sent me aid more than once when I was in need. So Paul wasn't afraid he wasn't going to sit back in his tent somewhere. And not take the gospel because he didn't know where the support was going to come from. I have a friend of mine that we spent some time in Japan together and he was an Air Force. I was in the Navy, he decided after we both came back to the country, and finish I think Florida College and Houston go to China and preach the gospel, and didn't really have any resources. So what did he do, he sold what he had, he sold his possessions. Literally, his house, his cars, took the gospel, and then he receives support. In fact, we're supporting him in Charlottesville, Virginia, Fred Newman is one of the guys that we support. But Paul wasn't concerned about where the money is gonna come from, when nobody else was going to help up Philippi jumped in there. He said, not that I desire your gifts, what I desire is that

Mike Roy  28:37
what I desire is that more be credited credited to your account, I am, I have received full payment, and I have more than enough, I am amply supplied now that I have received from the Pepperdine as to gifts that you sent. They are a fragrant offering and acceptable sacrifice pleasing to God. And verse 19, when those powerful statements in my God will meet all your needs, according to the riches of his glory in Christ Jesus. So we're saying when we're facing financial challenges, embrace it as a challenge, just like Abraham did. Maybe you wouldn't think about it in these terms. But when he left or of the counties to go to the promised land, he didn't know where he was going. He was shuffling. So he didn't know how he was going to get there. He didn't know if he was going to get there. He didn't know if he'd have enough provisions for his family. But he trusted that his God would supply all his needs, and God did supply all his needs, as he brought him to the promised land, and God will supply all your needs. So when we are facing the financial hardships and challenges that test our faith, and we know about all the things that we talked about this already this evening, this powerful truth, that God will supply all of our needs. We need to trust him to do that. So again, it's a mindset. It's mindset over skill set. That means that we understand that the challenge that we face has to be embraced like an adventure of faith. A couple of other points I want to talk about this evening. As we look at the seven keys to trusting God when money is tight, number six, practice generosity toward God and towards others a little bit different point then back from point for giving it back to God. But we'll go get second Corinthians chapter nine, verses six through 11. And again, look at the language over here. And when Paul is writing to these Christians and talking about them, reminding them to fulfill their pledge that they had made, live with what he says over here, the point is, over here said, Whoever so sparingly will also reap sparingly but whoever sows bountifully or generously will also reap bountifully. Each one was give us he is decided in his heart, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver, and God. God is able to make all grace of Balakot those words, they're all grace abound to you, so that having all sufficiency in all things at all times, you may abounds in every good work, wow. That God does supply all our knees when we practice generosity, that's sometimes the hard thing to do. As it is written, He has distributed freely he has given to the poor, his righteousness endures forever. He who supplies seed to the sower and bread for food, well supply and multiply your seed for sowing and increase the harvest of your righteousness, you will be enriched in every way to be generous in every way, which through us will provide thanksgiving to God. So again, here's a principle that is somewhat surprising, and maybe to us as we develop the right mindset towards financial challenges. And then as we practice, generosity, one other point that I want to mention this evening before we wrap up the lesson, and that is that we choose contentment over worry. And when we're facing the challenges of life, and we live in a materialistic world, ultimately, we need to choose the mindset of being content

Mike Roy  32:09
with the things that we have, and not putting additional strain on our lives as we try to keep up with the people in our community. Look at Philippians chapter four. And verses 10 through 14, this is the New American Standard Version. So Paul says concerning his need, and the support that he received from Philippi, so I rejoice in the Lord greatly, that now at last you have revived your concern for me. Indeed, you were concerned before but you lacked opportunity. Not that I speak from want but look at the phrase in the middle of verse 11. For I have learned to be content, how many of us can say that hopefully, as we get older, in our lives older in our faith, we learn to be content contentment is something that we have to learn we weren't born with that children are content, you give one toy they want to and anon down the road. So Paul says I've learned to be content in whatever circumstances I am, and know how to get along with humble means. And I also know how to live in prosperity. In any and every circumstance, I have learned the secret of being filled and going hungry, both of having abundance and suffering need, I can do all things through Him who strengthens me, that's still one of the most powerful truths in my mindset. Whatever I have to do whatever needs to be done, Paul said, I can do everything through Him who strengthens me, I've got that memorized the mind and a couple of different versions, but possible, I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me. And it's a choice. That means he even acknowledged in verse 14, nevertheless, you have done well to share with me in my affliction. But Paul says in the midst of that, that paragraph, I learned to be content. And that's a tall challenge for each of us. So one of my phrases that I go through life is Life is about choices. We choose contentment, or we choose materialism, we choose trust, or we choose worry and anger or anxiety, it's your choice. And it's my choice. Life is all about how we respond to God. Well, just by way of review this evening, the seven keys to trusting God when we're facing financial challenges, it's not about the money. We need to trust God with today, realize how rich we really are. Need to give it back to God. Embrace the challenge that you face as an adventurer and adventure of faith. That's really the essence of life that God's He wants us to take each day that comes to us as an adventure number six we practice generosity. We choose contentment. And that's right. I forgot I had number just had seven so we choose contentment. So that's what what God challenges us to do. because we face challenges in our lives, especially relating to finances, he wants us ultimately to trust him. The best way to do that is, first become a Christian. If you're here this evening, you haven't obeyed the gospel of Christ. Really to get the proper mindset and attitude towards finances. You need to yield your life to God's will and complete obedience to the gospel. And maybe that you've done that, and you're facing financial challenges in your life. You're not sure how to pay the next bill down the road. Again, it's about trusting God. We mentioned again, we are in the family of Christ, we're here to it's a safe place where we can open up and share our struggles. We all have them. I say that a lot. We all face our challenges. If there's any need that you have. If you want to share with us and request prayers on your behalf, we invite you to come while we stand and sing this invitation song
