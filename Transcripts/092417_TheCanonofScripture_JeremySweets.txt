Good evening. It's good to see everyone here tonight. It's been an encouraging service already, even if I didn't say a word, we'd been benefited by being here. First, especially appreciated Evans prayers, he talked about the situation we see in the world with the violence that happened just this afternoon and in our own backyard, and how truly sad that is. And I was interested, or I thought it was interesting that right after that came the Lord's Supper. So we placed those two things side by side, the realities of the world with sin and violence, yet the hope we have in Jesus Christ, so it's beneficial to be here, appreciate the songs that were led by Kevin to focus on God's word and the benefit that it provides for us. So a lot of good things there. This hour, we're gonna, or this portion of the hour, we're going to look at God's word. And I'd like to spend a few minutes talking about a subject, that I was asked to speak on it each Cheetham. And that the subject is the canon of Scripture, the canon of Scripture, this lesson might be a little bit different, we might focus a little bit more on history. But I think this does apply to things that are written in the Scriptures. And I think it's something that can be extremely beneficial for us today, as well. Looking at a 50,000 foot view, first of all, not an expert in this subject. And second of all, there's so much to talk about this that we will just barely be touching on. On a high level overview. I do know that Kurt has some material on the website, Bible class material talking about the origin, transmission translation of the Bible. So if this, this lesson does pique your interest, there's more to look at there. Second, Timothy 316. And 17 says all scripture is inspired by God or breathed out by God, and profitable for teaching for reproof, correction for instruction in righteousness, that the man of God may be complete or perfect, equipped for every good work. The Bible is breathed out by God, it comes from God. And in that sense, the Bible is unique and different than all other writings. Not that it has some kind of heavenly language or need some kind of special cipher to read it. It comes in every day, normal human language communication. But what is special and unique about the Bible is the fact that it comes from God, its source is God. Now as Christians, we proclaim that message, and we use the Bible as our standard of faith. It is the truth. And so we don't ask questions about do you feel like or do you think homosexuality is a sin? Or do you feel like it's okay to lie or to murder or things like that, we instead as Christians go to the standard, the source. And we want to know what God has to say about about those subjects, and many more. And so as we look at the Bible, we affirm that it comes from God. Now, this probably not be a surprise to you. But there are many that deny this fact. There are many that cast aspersions upon the scriptures and say that it is not from God. And one of the ways that they do that is by saying something along these lines, that it was something that developed over a process of time. And they'll emphasize the fact that it was a human endeavor. It was the church that simply picked out the books to use as the Bible, when they might say something like the Bible was invented in the fourth century. The church didn't have scriptures until the fourth century. So all those kinds of statements are floating around out there, trying to indicate that the Bible was something that came much later after the first century. And so I just like to spend some time looking at this subject. I think it can be faith building for us and give us confidence in the scriptures.

So as we talk about the canon of Scripture, first of all, let me just tell you a little bit about where that word comes from. There's a Hebrew word Kunta means read or measuring stick. In fact, you can find an example of this and First Kings 14 And verse 15 says, For the Lord shall smite Israel as a read is shaken in the water. And so just as you would see, those cat tails or those reads that were in the water, it was something that was a stick standing out of the water. And so that's that same word, the cannon another idea. This is a measuring read in Ezekiel 14 Verse five says, and behold a wall on the outside of the house roundabout, and in the man's hand, a measuring read of six cubits long. And so we see that here a read was something that was a natural object found in nature that could be used for the purpose of making measurements making measurements. When we come to the New Testament, we see that this word comes forward into Greek and simply means rule standard or a limit. In Galatians, six and verse 16, it says, For all who walk according to this rule, or this Canon, for all who walk according to the standard, well, this word was brought forward to apply to the collection of Scripture. And so when we talk about the canon in reference to the Bible, we're talking about those writings that have been deemed to be divinely inspired those writings that fit within that category of Second Timothy three of works that are breathed out by God. And so that is something that took a process to happen. And as we look at that process, we need to understand that that process makes sense. It makes sense.

If I were to hold up my Bible, here, this is what we're used to when we talk about the Bible. Now this has a single binding, it looks like one book. But the Bible was different than books that are published today. I know that many of you are Harry Potter fans, and whether you are or not, you know that that book was published on a specific date. In fact, if you're really into those books, you probably went there the night before, just as it was released. So on a day, that book was released or published for for everybody, it had a single date of publication. See, the Bible doesn't quite work like that. In fact, it is it is a collection of books. I realize you're aware of this, but it helps to state this. It is a collection of books, and this collection has 66 books in it in two major collections. 39 books in the Old Testament, 27 books in the New Testament, there's approximately 40 Different authors over 1600 years that wrote this. They wrote in three different languages. They wrote from different cultures and backgrounds and geographical locations. But as we look at this great diversity of these individual books that were written, we see that they are they comprise one book, one book of God, and so that one book has a divine author, and it has one narrative thread throughout. Now, it's interesting to note that within all that diversity of all the different people and times and, and locations and languages and cultural backgrounds, the scripture has one message. The Scripture has one narrative that flows throughout the entire book. Now how is that possible? That is possible because it is a book that comes from the mind of God. Yes, human authors were used. But it is a book that comes from the mind of God, it is breathed out by God. So it's important to notice that the Bible is not a book that was published on a date. But rather, it is a collection of books that took hundreds of years to write. So in light of that thought it would make sense that the collecting of those books into into a single collection would be a process, it's not something that would happen overnight. It's not something that would have a publication date, like some kind of Harry Potter book, the Bible is different in that regard. So it's important to note that we're going to look at the two collections. This is a chart that I'm bored offline. And so as we look at this, we're gonna first talk about the Old Testament books. The Old Testament books were get gathered into three sections, the law of Moses, and sometimes when in the New Testament, when they talk about the law, that may stand for the entire Old Testament collection. Sometimes they talk about the law and the prophets. In fact, you remember, Jesus said that He came not to abolish the law and the prophets, or when he talked about the golden rule, he said on these depend on the Law and the Prophets and very similar statement in Matthew 22. And he said, Love the Lord your God. That's the first commandment on these hang the law and the prophets. By the time of the first century, the collection of the Old Testament was taking shape or taking form, and it contained these three sections. In fact, in Luke 24 And verse 44, we see a reference by Jesus. As he was walking on the road to Emmaus. He said that everything written about Me in the Law of Moses and the prophets and the Psalms must be fulfilled. As we look at this chart, you can see the Old Testament divided into different sections. And these are a little bit different than our English sections. And so they had the law you probably heard the word torah is the Hebrew word for law, the Prophets the never aim. And this would have combined some of the books that were used to dividing like kings and Samuel, they would have had a single collection there. And also notice that the 12, the 12, minor prophets would have been one book, one scroll, and then they had these these writings here, other books, and so that would have included our much of our wisdom literature with Psalm Proverbs, job Song of Solomon, included some what we would consider some history with Ruth, and historical books, Daniel, Ezra, Nehemiah, and then also Chronicles. So by the time of the first century, you see that this collection was taking shape, for there to be a reference to the law refers to that collection that was there and the Prophets the same, same thing. Some people have suggested that this even goes back earlier to about 132 would be the earliest reference where they see a man named Joshua Ben Sira, who refer to the law itself, the prophecies and the rest of the books. And so if you think for just a little bit about this timeline here, if we were to say, a cut off for the Old Testament, when the writings ceased, we could say about 400, you might say, as little before that a little bit after that, well, we use that as a general point of noticing the end there. And so by the time of the first century, by the time of Jesus, you're gonna see that that that collection has taken shape. And so they would have had these writings that were passed down over this time. And they would have looked at these writings and consider these writings. And so there was a process as they carefully carried their collection forward. And that process would have taken a few 100 years to develop. And so we see that the Hebrew Bible developed in this way. Now, as we look at some confirmations of the Old Testament, we can see this in a few different places. First of all, in Josephus, he wrote about 90 ad and he has this to say about about this collection of the Old Testament, said, we have not myriad of books, disagreeing and conflicting with one another, but only 22, containing the record of all time and justly accredited. Of these five are the books of Moses containing the laws and the history handed down from the creation of the human race right to his own death. This period falls a little short of 3000 years, from the death of Moses to the time of our desert sees who is the king of Persia after Xerxes, the prophets who followed Moses have written down in 13, books, the things that were done in their days. The remaining four books contain hymns to God and principles of life for human beings. Josephus references 22 books. You'll notice on this previous chart that there are 24 books, and that simply may be the exact collection, but maybe they were combined in slightly different ways. For example, maybe Ruth was an appendix to judges. And so those are often placed together. If you see that continuation. So many believe that he is talking about this exact same collection that we have, as they're mentioned on this chart, and provided in this chart.

Jeremy Sweets  14:21
We also see that there was a council after the destruction of Jerusalem in 70 ad the Council of jam, Nia, and this council seems to have recognized the the tradition that had been passed down on the books that were provided. And they seem to confirm that, in fact, they have a discussion about some of these disputed books, some of these books that were less clear as far as whether they belonged in the canon and so they had a discussion about that. So I haven't mentioned that but kind of skipped over that. So you'll see that some of these books are are disputed books. And that simply means that if you were to look at categories of these books, there were some that were recognized by all. They were passed forward and very readily recognized, recognized. But in that process of development, there were a handful, where there were question marks about these things. And so they were things that were discussed, for example, in the book of Esther, the name of God is not mentioned. And so some people question about should this be considered inspired or something that comes from God? Chronicles is a repetition of much of the history that we find in Samuel and Kings. And so there was some question there. Song of Songs is not a book we preach from much it has a little bit different content. And so there is some question about talking about romantic love and those and those kinds of terms. And so there was some questions that went back and forth about some of these books. And they talked about those things. And in general, the consistent consensus came about. And that consensus, as I mentioned, was completed by the time of the first century. In the apocalypse of Ezra, which was an apocryphal book, it was not inspired. But around the first century, it mentions the fact that there were 24 books, again, using the numbering system that we saw on the previous chart. And so all these confirmations show us that over that period of time, and by the time of the first century, there seems to be a pretty fixed canon, measuring rod standard of writings that were determined to be from God by the community. And so we see the confirmations that we find there from from those witnesses. And there are other other confirmations as well. But these are a few. Now let's talk about the New Testament, I mentioned that there are quotes and quotes abound about the fact that the New Testament was something that was invented, I found a couple of these quotes online, one of them@deism.com, and another one at Mountain man.com. I don't know these particular sites very well. But I found these quotes to be representative of what I what I can hear from people. The first one says the Bible was not handed to mankind by God, nor was it dictated to humans to non ographers by God, it has nothing to do with God. And actuality the Bible was voted to be the word of God by a group of men during the fourth century. Mountain man.com, says the canonical books were fabricated under the commission of Constantine with Eusebius, as their editor in chief between 312 and 324, C E. So both of these quotes state the fact that the Bible was invented, or the Bible was fabricated, and that didn't occur until, until the fourth century, a similar thought of this as found in and

Jeremy Sweets  18:21
the movie, The Davinci Code. And so there, they apply that to the divinity of Jesus, that was something that was invented in the fourth century voted on upon by councils. One of the scholar, so called scholars that was quoted in that fictional work says something along those lines, that before the fourth Gentry century, the church considered Jesus to be merely a man. And it wasn't until the fourth century based on political reasons that he was deemed to be divine. It's very, very poor history that doesn't line up with the historical record. But this is what people are saying. And this is what skeptics will say about the scriptures. So I want to examine the New Testament canon and the development process as it came about. So let's notice a few things there. There are confirmations of the New Testament, just as there were of the Old Testament. One of the oldest of these came about 150 ad. And it lists 22 of the 27 books. Hebrews, James First and Second Peter and Third John are excluded, while wisdom of Solomon and the apocalypse of Peter were included. And so this comes about 151 50 Very shortly after the time of the New Testament. And already by this time, you see the majority of the work being agreed upon. The majority of the works are the the letters and writings it was agreed upon. By this time Do you see a further confirmation by a Arrhenius in one Adi ad, he identifies the four gospels, Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. And he states, it is not possible that the Gospels can be either more or fewer a number than they are. Now he makes

Jeremy Sweets  20:20
an application to four and the four seasons and things like that. And what do you agree on his idea of for being necessary, you see that by this time, he's identified the four Gospels. These are the four gospels that were employed and and in use. By the time of the fourth century, you see that that in general, the Canon was recognized Eusebius, who was mentioned earlier, was involved in some of those councils. And he'd identified three groupings of books recognized, disputed, and rejected. And so recognized books would have included the four Gospels, X, Paul's epistles, First John, First Peter and revelation. Some of the disputed books included James, Jude, second, Peter, second, and third John. And then he lists some of the rejected books. So by and large, most of the books were recognized from from the very early time, and that tradition was passed down, there were a handful of books in which there was some discussion about whether they should be included or not. But again, by the time of the fourth century, it was determined that they should, and that was not a flipping of the coin, but that was through a process of debate, where they went back and forth, and you see hundreds of years of collecting this evidence and making a decision. And so not just a, a quick, arbitrary decision that was made. With the Council of Athenaeus, and 367, and council of carcinogen, 397, you see, the full 27 books that we would consider to be canonical, the books in our Bible, were recognized. And so again, if you were to take 100 ad is the stopping point of the writing of the New Testament, you're gonna find that it took two to 300, you can maybe even go to 400, there's a process of two or 300 years of this collection of the books, again, shouldn't surprise us. There were many letters written to different churches, and that it took a time to collect and to make a determination on these books should not be a surprising thing. In fact, that carried through from that tradition that had gone all the way back. I think we can get even more encouragement from the fact when we look at the criteria for for inclusion of the books. Again, this was not an arbitrary process. This was not arbitrarily voted on in the fourth century. Let's just pick some books. This was not invented or fabricated. In fact, they had fairly stringent tests of what should be included as scripture. What what is God? Bree? The first one is that is apostolic. It had some connection, it was either written by an apostle or someone closely associated with the apostles, and Ephesians two and verse 20. It says, the household of God was built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus Himself being the cornerstone. The scriptures itself points to the fact that the household of God is built upon the foundation of the apostles. Paul says in Colossians, one and verse one, he calls himself an apostle by the will of God, and apostle by the will of God. And He also seems to recognize his writings as authoritative because he says, and ask that these letters be distributed to other churches, these letters should be read widely. And so we see this idea of apostolic, apostolic, that it would come from the apostles. We know that, that would that criteria makes sense from what we see of Scripture that the apostles were so heavily involved in the writing of scriptures and receiving the words of Christ and passing those on. This was even widely recognized by by many, you see, in the second and third centuries, a whole lot of letters that that purport to be are claimed to be from the apostles. Now, why would those claims be made? Why would they say this is Peter writing, you know, in the second or third century? Well, even the forgers recognize eyes what was considered to be authentic? And so they said, Well, if this, if I want other people to accept this, I need to put a name of an apostle on this. And so even within the the forgeries that were made later, you see a recognition of this criteria apostolic.

Jeremy Sweets  25:21
Another one is orthodoxy, orthodoxy. And that simply means that that it teaches truth, truth is consistent with itself. So the Scriptures, the books that were collected, needed to have a consistent message to be a message that is not contradictory. You see an example of this in Deuteronomy, chapter 18. There it says, If a prophet comes to you, and if he speaks presumptuously, one way to tell that as if he speaks a word, and it does not come true, you know that that message is not from God. God's not the author of laws. And so if there's a prophecy or a prediction that's made, and that doesn't occur, that writing and that prophet is not from God. In first Corinthians chapter 12, in verses two and three, really, I think that should be verse three. But you see a similar reference about the consistency of truth. There, it says in verse three, therefore, I make known to you that no one's speaking by the Spirit of God says Jesus is accursed. And no one can say Jesus is Lord except by the Holy Spirit. So do you see the connection that's there, Paul says that you can't come in the name of God, and say Jesus is accursed, because that contradicts the truthfulness of what has been revealed. And in the same way, if you're going to say Jesus is Lord, that's not going to come from something that's false. That is a true word. And so as they looked at these different writings, they tested the writings further truthfulness, their truthfulness. Another thing that we look at as into antiquity, antiquity, and so this is related to apostolic, the apostles in the first century, would have handed down their writings and those writings would have been the oldest writings, the Christian writings that we have in the Bible are the oldest writings that we have. And so it makes sense that they would look for something that is older that that would span further back in time. And so we see antiquity. And there's also traditional use, once again, let me emphasize that the the writings and the collection, the books of the Bible, there was not a coin flip in the fourth century. And it was not new, in the fourth century, that these books were used. These were books that had been passed down that had been being used by the church for a number of years. And so in the fourth century, if they came upon a work that was new, they would be more suspicious of that, a work that had not been traditionally being used that did not have that the antiquity included within it. And so we see the criteria and the criteria that was used for the New Testament canon. So that's the lesson that I have. But I hope that that lesson can, can bring you encouragement and strength. Our Bible is not the product of men. It was collected by men, God used men. But it was a process that happened over a number of years. And I have, I have faith and trust that the book that we have the Bible is the very breathed out word of God. And that's the word we need to be preaching. And that's the word that we need to be proclaiming. And so I have no doubt in that. Let me also add that I believe that God inspired or breathed out his word. I also believe that God helped or guided that process where the collection was made, that only makes sense to me, that God wants us to have his word because it is the Life Saving Word of God. And so just as God's word was breathed out by him, I was inspired by him. I believe that we have the book that God wants us to have. Now that doesn't mean we shouldn't look at the evidence. We shouldn't consider these things. We shouldn't take these things into account. But I believe that we can have faith and trust in this word as the word of God as the word of God. If you're here tonight and you're not a Christian, you have an opportunity to obey the Word of God, believing that Jesus is the cause. iced, repenting of your sins and turning away from a lifestyle of sin, and to a lifestyle of service, confessing that Jesus is the Christ and being baptized in the water for the forgiveness of your sins.

Jeremy Sweets  30:11
If you're here tonight and you are a Christian, you have an opportunity to make amends. If you're not living as you should, if you're not honoring the commitment that you originally made, whatever your situation, examine your own heart and make sure you don't leave here tonight without doing what is right, and making sure that your life is right. If there's any subjects of imitation please come as we stand and sing at this time.
