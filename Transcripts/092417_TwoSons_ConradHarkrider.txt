If you have your Bibles and want to be turning to Matthew chapter 21. Matthew 21, we're going to be looking at the parable of the two sons this morning.

Conrad Harkrider  00:21
Matthew 21, good to see each of you here. Today, before we get into the text, just to try to set the stage of what's occurring at this point in Jesus's ministry. This would ultimately be the final week of his life as he makes his way into Jerusalem. And during this time, there was a tremendous amount of pressure and tension between him and the Jewish leaders. The Pharisees and the chief priests, for lack of a better term hated this young rabbi who had gained so much attention from the people. If you remember, as he entered into the city, they were lining the streets and shouting Hosanna, to the son of David. And so there was a lot of jealousy. And they were looking for a way in order to bring him down to discredit him in the eyes of the people that come to him in Matthew chapter 21. And they confront him asking him a series of questions. But instead of responding and giving them a straightforward answer, Jesus turns the table on them. He asked them a question, and then he gives them this parable. And what he does here is he exposes or he opens, and shows the true character and nature of their hearts. As we look at their response and thinking about, think about the attitudes, and the character that we're trying to develop, it helps us to see the type of people that God is seeking to serve Him. Read with me in Matthew chapter 21, beginning in verse 23. It says, now they came into the temple, the chief, now when he came into the temple, the chief priests, and the elders of the people confronted him as he was teaching and said, By what authority? Are you doing these things? And who gave you this authority? But Jesus answered and said to them, I also will ask you one thing, which if you tell me, I, likewise, will tell you by what authority I do these things, the baptism of John, where was it from? from heaven or from men? And they reason among themselves saying, If we say from heaven, He will say to us, why then did you not believe him? But if we say, from men, we fear the multitude for all count John as a prophet. So they answered Jesus and said to him, we do not know. And he said to them, neither will I tell you by what authority, I do these things. The text says in verse 23, that Jesus was teaching in the temple. And at that point, the chief priests, and the rulers come up to him, and they ask him a question about authority. They say, By what authority? Are you doing these things? What gives you the right to be doing what you're doing? They most likely were referring to earlier in chapter 21, when Jesus had come into Jerusalem, and he went into the temple, and saw people selling and buying animals and exchanging money, and He overturned the tables, and drove them out. And now he's standing in the temple teaching people he's receiving this praise and honor from the crowds as they're shouting out Hosanna. And so they are essentially asking, Who does this guy think he is? Remember, Jesus is a young man, at this point, not much gray in the beard at 33 years old. And so these elders want to know what makes him think that he is so special. Instead of answering their question, Jesus turns the table and he poses his own question to then he asked them about the baptism of John. And he says that if you are willing to answer this question, then I will give you a response about where my authority comes from. In verse 25, he says the baptism of John where was this from John the Baptist that a centric, crazy man who lived out in the wilderness As he wore unusual clothes and he ate unusual food, and all of the people were coming out to see him, Where was his ministry from? Jesus helps them out a little bit by narrowing it down to a couple of options.

Conrad Harkrider  05:18
It gives them an A or B choice. He says it was either from heaven or from men. And in verse 25, they don't really answer right away, it says that they reasoned or discussed it. among themselves. I'm kind of picturing something like if you've seen the game show Family Feud, where the contestants will sort of congregate to the side. And they'll have that little discussion before they give their final answer. And they're talking it over and whispering and trying to figure out what they're going to say. And that's what we see here. They're going through the options about what they're going to answer, and they realize that they are kind of in a pickle. If they answer and say that this is from heaven. They understand that to say it is from heaven means that it is approved, it is authorized, it is divinely established, it's something that came from God. And that infers that it is something that should be accepted, and followed. And they don't want to choose that option, because they had rejected the ministry of John the Baptist. The second option was to say that this baptism is for men. That is that it is manmade, it's human designed, it was a creation and a thought that came from a person. And in that case, there's no imperative to follow it, or to believe it. Now, this wasn't a good option, either, because all of the people accepted and believed that John was a prophet sent from God. So they're kind of sitting on the fence here, they don't want to say that it's from heaven. Because they didn't accept it, that would indict them. But they also don't want to say that it's from men, because they don't want any kind of repercussion or negative response coming from the people. And so they decided to give the following answer, we don't know they don't commit either way. And Jesus, you have to just think that he knew where this was going, he looks at them and says, then I'm not going to tell you where my authority comes from. To further illustrate their heart, he then gives a parable of the two sons. And that's where we're going to focus the rest of our time. Look at Matthew 21 and verse 28. He says, but what do you think a man had two sons, and he came to the first and said, Son, go work today in my vineyard. He answered and said, I will not. but afterward he regretted it, and went, then he came to the second and said, likewise. And he answered and said, I go, sir, but he did not go. Which of the two did the will of his Father? And they said to him, the first Jesus said to them, Assuredly, I say to you, the tax collectors in the harlots enter into the kingdom of God before you For John came to you in the way of righteousness, and you did not believe him. But the tax collectors and harlots believed him. And when you saw it, you did not afterward relent. And believe him. Jesus gives a account or a parable of to a man who has these two sons. And he asked them to go and work in his vineyard. And the first son that he comes to declares in verse 29, that I will not go he basically just says that he's he's not going to do it. You have any young children like that. There's no question about how they're feeling about the situation. They just come right out and tell you I am not going to wear that. I am not helping to clean up. And oftentimes that's accompanied by the, you know, the Crossed arms or the clenched fists, but they're just digging in their heels and saying, There's no way that I'm going to go along with that. But then something happens in verse 29. It says that he regretted it. The ESV says that he changed his mind at some point he decides

Conrad Harkrider  09:50
that he's made a mistake that it would be better to do the will of his Father than to continue on with his initial course. With what he initially thought he was going to do, and so he goes to work in the vineyard. Meanwhile, the father approaches the second son, he didn't have much success, or at least initially, it didn't appear that there was much success with his first. And so he asked his second son to go and work in the vineyard. And this son says that he will, I will, I'll go sir, in verse 30. He doesn't make any excuses, he doesn't protest, he willingly agrees to do what he's been asked to do. Let me tell you, as a parent, that's a that's a great feeling, isn't it? Especially when there's other people around and you ask your kids to do something, and there's, there's no push back. Consider this hypothetical illustration. You're outside playing in the yard, it's starting to get close to the evening to bedtime, and you tell your kids to go in and start getting ready for bed. And they say, okay, they stop what they're doing. And they head through the door. And you kind of look at your wife, like, Did you just see that? Is this really happening? Like we are great parents. So after about 10 minutes, you go inside the house, and it's kind of quiet upstairs and you're sort of wondering what's going on. So you head up there to check on the progress and you're expecting to find little people who are dressed and ready for bed. But instead, you walk in there are books on the floor, there are toys everywhere, that puzzle from grandma that's got 500 pieces, has exploded through the room. And you look down at one of them. And you try to calmly ask, what are you doing? And they look up from their pile of toys and say we're getting ready for bed.

Conrad Harkrider  12:07
They are doing, not what you've asked them to do, but what they want to do. Jesus reveals that despite this second son's verbal willingness to go and work, he doesn't follow through with that. He never shows up at the vineyard never reports for duty. And when Jesus asked the chief priests and the elders and he says, Which one of these sons did the will of his Father? They actually answer the question. They say it was the first son, the one who, after it was all said and done, he goes to, he goes to work in the vineyard. Now, this is a pretty straightforward and simple parable to understand. There's not a lot of technical things going on here. But in verse 31, and verse 32, Jesus really drives it home, and he gives the application and he shows them what the meaning is. And he says that the tax collectors and the prostitutes, were going to enter into God's kingdom ahead of these leaders. Now, you don't have to be a biblical scholar to understand that those two groups of people were not models for religious conduct, and behavior. And yet Jesus says that those with this clouded and shameful paths would be brought in, they would be preferred over the most dedicated and religious people of the day. These Pharisees, these, these chief priests, these are the ones that are offering the sacrifices. They're serving in the temple. They're ministering among the people. They know the word, the law of Moses, and yet they had missed it. They had gone past God's true intention. As we think about some applications this morning, consider the fact that God is looking for specific kinds of people. And here you have a group of people that Jesus is rebuking because they weren't following. They weren't going down the path that the Lord had laid out. God like a employer or a department that has certain types of skills or characteristics that they are searching for. So the Lord has certain attitudes that are essential to be one of his children. First of all, notice from verse 26, that God is seeking those who fear Him above man. Look at verse 26. It says, but if we say from men, we fear the multitude for all count John As a prophet, God is looking for people who will respect and honor him above men. The elders, when they're having a little side conversation, they say that we can't answer in this way, because we don't want to upset the people. We don't want them to get mad at us, we don't want them to think less of us. They were more concerned about their appearance, and how other people were going to perceive them than they were with pleasing God. Fear fearing God means that fearing God above man means doing the right thing. Even when it's difficult. When Joseph was put into service in potter's house, he had some success. He was given some responsibility. But then there was a conflict, there was some pressure that started to get put on him. And he was being asked to do something that he knew wasn't right. And he had to make a decision. What am I going to do? Am I going to please and follow through with those who are over me what they're asking me to do. Joseph had to have known that Potiphar, his wife had the ability and the means to make his life miserable. And she ultimately does she removes him from his position. He's accused of something that he didn't do, he's placed in to prison. But do you remember what he told her? In Genesis 39? And verse nine? He said, How can I do this great wickedness and sin against God, this was an offense not just against the master or against the whole setup of the house, this would be going against the Lord. And it shows that Joseph is more concerned about what God thinks,

Conrad Harkrider  17:06
and how God would be affected by this than the people who were around him. The question we have to ask ourselves is, who are we trying to please do we fear men more than we fear God. And this gets so practical in our our choices every day, when I wear certain types of clothes. And my trying to appeal to my friends, or my classmates, or co workers or people around me, my looking for some type of attention, where they will say, that person looks really good, they're attractive, they're in style, whatever it may be, or to the clothes that I wear reflect a gentle and quiet spirit, something that Peter says, is very precious in the sight of God. First Peter three and verse four. What about the words that we speak? When we're in a group of people, and we're talking and we're choosing words to say and stories to tell? Is our focus and our emphasis on trying to make others laugh, to appear cool, or strong or tough? Who are we fearing? When we draw the attention back on ourselves and say things to get some type of reaction, we tell a story about someone else at their expense, we're saying things to get arise. Our words should be things that bring grace to those who hear. Some people think that there's conversation that can happen in front of grandma, and then conversation that can happen with the boys. Regardless of grandma is around the Lord always hears we need to ask ourselves, do I care more about what people think? Am I concerned more concerned about being well liked? Or about doing what's right? And in this case, these leaders as they confer together, they're just thinking about how is this going to affect my image? How am I going to be perceived based on what I choose to do? We also see from this account, Matthew 21, that God is looking for people who emphasize substance over for in the case of the parable, the second son he verbally agrees to go into the vineyard and to work but he never shows up. He has a form of obedience and compliance. But there's no sign stunts behind it, how common it is in our day for people to make assertions that they are going to do something but then there's no backing behind it in sales. This is common. You tried to say whatever you can to close the deal, trying to get people to sign on the dotted line, you can bring it back, you will repair it for free. There's no charge, you know, lifetime guarantee, whatever it may be. But that doesn't always turn out to be the case. Or how about in politics? On the campaign trail, people are making bold promises, they're laying out their grand vision for the future about how everything is going to be bigger and better once they get in to office. But after the election comes, all of the sudden, all of a sudden those ambitious plans start to get put to the side. And what about in our lives? Do we say? Things do we make assertions Do we believe things in our heart. But then when you peel it back, it's just form. It's just air, there's really no substance behind it. I may say that family is extremely important to me. But then you look at how I spend my time I go to work, I come home, I work in the yard, I watch a little TV, I play on the phone, I get on my computer, spend a little bit of a bedtime routine, and then I'm back to my own stuff. And so who am I really caring about? It sounds odd. We would never say my computer and my technology are extremely important to me. But yet, when you look at my actions and the substance behind it, what does it point to? This was an ongoing issue for the Jewish leaders.

Conrad Harkrider  22:04
They emphasized the external, the outside more than they did the heart. And so again, and again, Jesus is pointing this out that appearances are not everything just because they seem to be doing God's will doesn't mean they are actually following him. In Matthew chapter six, in verse five, he says, When you pray, you must not be like the hypocrites, hypocrites, for they'd love to stand and pray in the synagogues and at the street corners, that they may be seen by others Truly I say to you, they have received their reward. Matthew chapter 15, in verse eight, Jesus says, These people honor me with their lips, but their heart is far from me. In vain do they worship me teaching as doctrines the commandments of men. If you've ever been on a set before a movie set, or maybe for a stage for a play, you've seen how they can completely transform that area to look like a real place where there's houses and buildings. But we all know those are actual real structures. In fact, you could probably go up to one of those props and put your hand on it and and push it over. There's no concrete, there's no steel, there's no foundation behind it. Does that describe our service to God? It's sobering to think that we can spend our entire lives doing religious things come into church, singing, praying, taking the Lord's supper or being with other religious people. And yet there is no substance behind it. God is looking for more than just mechanical worship people who are just looking the part. He says in Hosea chapter six and verse six, I desire steadfast love and not sacrifice the knowledge of God rather than burnt offerings. What he wants is a relationship, a true connection to people where we are doing the things we're motivated because of our love or respect for God. We desire to serve him not because of how it will appear to others, but because it's the right thing to do. And finally, God is seeking people. This parable shows us who are willing to repent. God wants people who have a humble attitude and who are willing to change despite the direction that they may have started out as is the case of this for Her son here who openly says that he is not going to work for his father. In verse 32, it says, For John came to you in the way of righteousness and you did not believe him, but the tax collectors and harlots believed him. And when you saw it, you did not afterward relent and believe him. The indictment against these leaders is that they were unwilling to change. Compared to some other people, they were unwilling to redirect their course. God ultimately accepts these tax collectors and prostitutes, not because they had never done anything wrong, not because they were perfect, and they had this flawless track record. But because they altered their direction based upon the truth that they had heard that back in the 50s, my grandfather, enlisted in the Air Force during the Korean War. And during high school, he was fortunate enough to learn how to use a typewriter, not a skill that a lot of young men had. But because of that ability, it kept him sitted seated at a desk rather than out on a battlefield, he was assigned to a group that was transcribing different correspondences. And the commanders would dictate something and they would have to type out these messages and these letters, and they had to be absolutely perfect. There was no Backspace on the typewriter, you can just erase a misspelled word or a character that was out of order, whatever it may be, they would have to take it out and start over completely. God is not looking for people without any mistakes.

Conrad Harkrider  27:01
He's not looking for somebody who has gone through life without any mess ups are imperfections, or setbacks or failures. That's why Jesus came he came to seek and save those who are lost. He is looking for people who despite their imperfections, and their weaknesses, and the temptations that they struggle with. He is seeking for those who are willing to change their lives and follow Him. In Matthew chapter 11, and verse 28, Jesus said, Come to me all who labor and are heavy laden and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you and learn from me for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls. Have you found that great peace and rest that comes by having a relationship with Jesus Christ? Regardless of what you've done in your past, whether you've stood up to the Lord and said, I won't do it, you can now go and serve in his vineyard. And he is the only one who provides that true peace and fulfill me. We close this morning with an with an invitation to all who are here to make their lives right with God. To submit their hearts to the Lord so that one day we can stand before him blameless. There's something that we can do to encourage you in your walk. Please come down to the front as we stand and sing
