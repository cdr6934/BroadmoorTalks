Good morning if you want to open up your Bibles to Zachariah the fourth chapter.

Conrad Harkrider  00:28
Well, you don't have to be a civil engineer to know that Nashville is going through a construction boom. If you drive around the city, you seen the cranes that mark the the city skyline. According to one website that tracks the projects, there are nearly 200 commercial real estate projects that are in the pipeline. The business is certainly booming. Although over the last few months, several of those have started to slow down or even come to a standstill, because of disruptions to the supply chain not being able to get the materials or a shortage of labor supply or even running out of money. Some of the projects have had to slow down. When God's people came out of captivity, and they returned to the land of Judah, one of the first things that God wanted them to do was to begin rebuilding the temple that had been destroyed. And when they came out into the land, Zerubbabel led the people and they began this project and they had some early success, they laid the foundation to shouts of great joy. But after a while there was opposition, there was resistance. There was a lack of motivation by the people. And so the project began to stall. And it's at that point that God sends a couple of prophets to the land Haggai and Zechariah. They're going to bring a message of encouragement, a message of hope for the future to try and motivate God's people to continue building this great and continuing this great work. And so let's read and Zachariah, chapter four, about some of the admonitions and the encouragement that God offers. In this effort to get his people to build to be building for the Lord raised me in Zachariah chapter four, beginning in verse six. It says, Then he said to me, this is the word of the Lord is irredeemable, not by might, nor by power, but by My Spirit, says the Lord of hosts, who are you, oh, great mountain before Zerubbabel, you shall become a plane. And he shall bring forward the topstone amid shouts of grace, grace to it, then the word of the Lord came to me saying, the hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house, his hands shall also complete it, then you will know that the Lord of hosts has sent me to you, for whoever has despise the day of small things shall rejoice, and shall see the plumb line in the hand observable. In the Book of Zachariah, the first six chapters of the book outline, eight night visions, these visions are intended to give a picture of what is about to take place. Some of the visions relate to the city of Jerusalem, and talk about how God is going to come and dwell that his presence will dwell in the city. Other visions relate to the nations that are around them, and how God was going to bring judgment upon them because of what they had done to his people. But right in the middle of these sections of visions, visions four and five are going to center on to key figures, to leaders who were helping God's people during this time. In chapter three, Vision four pertains to Joshua, the high priest, and if you remember Joshua is standing in the presence of God and He is clothed with filthy garments. But the Lord comes and says, To remove the garments to take them away to give him fresh, clean robes. This would signify how God was going to remove the iniquity of the land in a single day. The second vision, or the vision number five, in chapter four,

Conrad Harkrider  05:16
right where we're reading here focuses on the leader durable. And now he would be tasked with rebuilding God's temple. In order to make this picture vivid in their minds, God presents to Zachariah this night dream about a lampstand. It has seven lights on the top of it, but it's no ordinary Lampstand because over this Golden Lampstand, there is a bowl that is filled with oil, it's a reservoir, a supply of oil. Beside the lampstand, there are two olive trees, and they are feeding. They have golden pipes that are feeding in to the bowl. It says if there is this continual, never ending supply of oil, God is showing his people that the light will turn on that worship will resume that the temple will be rebuilt. And that God's presence will continually be with him. He will supply them with the oil so that the worship of God can continue. In chapter four and verse four, after seeing this vision about the lampstand, you have to love Zacharias response, he asked the question, he says, What is this? Even though he's a prophet, he still is not afraid or ashamed to ask questions. And the angel says, Don't you know what this is? And Zachariah just says, No, I don't. And so here in verses six through 10, the explanation from the angel is given about what this Lampstand represents. And what we'll see here in just a few moments is there are some incredible lessons, some encouragement, some words of strengthening that are given to the people, things that they need to remember if they are going to continue building for the Lord. The exiles that had returned back from the land, under the direction of the rubble, had begun to rebuild the temple in 538 BC. And as we said earlier, they were able to lay the foundation, amid shouts of great joy. But after starting the project, the work was ultimately stopped. There was a lack of resources, there was pressure from their enemies. And so the project became stalled. And not just stalled for a few days or a couple of weeks. But for years, 15 plus years would pass from the time that the people came back into the land, until Haggai in Zachariah would come and encourage them to continue to build. And so the the words here in chapter four, are not just something nice to say, but this is the fuel this is the ignition to get God's people moving again. And so if we're going to build for the Lord, notice what we have to do in our time as well as what they had to do in their time. Look at verse six.

Conrad Harkrider  08:45
It says in verse six, then he said to me, this is the word of the Lord to Zerubbabel, not by might nor by power, but by My Spirit, says, The Lord of whole of hosts. In order to build the people would have to verse six, rely on his strength. The Lord tells the rubble that this is not going to happen because of his power, his ability, his strength, but instead they would be successful because of the Lord's spirit. The Lord was the one that would enable him he was the one that would bring about their success if they were willing to depend on his strength. from a human perspective, what is it that you need in order to accomplish a great building project, you need materials and supplies, you need the labor, the human force behind it, and of course you need money. You also during this time would need an army to protect you so that your progress wouldn't be impeded by enemies or by attacks. And if you compare the rubble and his people and the work that they had to do with salt Solomon, during his time when he was constructing the First Temple, all of the resources that were at Solomon's disposal, that comparison is it's not even close. In First Chronicles 22, in verse 14, David began making preparations for this temple. And he says, I have David speaking, I have taken great pains to provide for the temple of the Lord 100,000 talents of gold, a million talents of silver, quantities of bronze and iron two great to be weighed and wood and stone. And you may add to them. You have many workers, stone cutters, masons and carpenters, as well as those skilled in every kind of work in gold and silver, bronze and iron craftsmen beyond number. Now begin the work and the Lord be with you. It's unbelievable to see all that was in his possession. Solomon, as he begins to make this temple Zerubbabel barely has a militia to protect the people, the city walls of Jerusalem have been broken down the land is in complete poverty. How is it possible for them to accomplish this task? It wouldn't be because Zerubbabel was such a great leader. Because he was so strong or because he was able to influence the people or even coerce or intimidate them into begin beginning this project this building. But rather, they would only be successful by trusting in trusting themselves to the Lord, through the blessing of the Lord. And this is not something that is a new idea in the scriptures that it just shows up in Zachariah. But throughout God's Word, we see this theme again and again, that God finds situations that seem improbable, that seem unlikely, that are extremely difficult. He uses that situation to bring about his purposes in his plans. Let's give a few examples. And then we'll talk about why why God does it that way. First of all, there was a man who was 100 years old, married to a woman who is 90. And it was this couple that God chose to bless with a child that would come a great nation, the children of Israel, Abraham and Sarah, you say, Well, why not pick a man who's younger? Why not pick a man who has 30 sons, you know, if one of them gets sick or ends up dying, then the the nation can continue on No. Instead, he chose this old man and woman through which he would bless the entire world. Also think about when God is selecting a king for his people. He goes to the house of a man named Jesse. And he chooses his youngest son, who is not a well prepared warrior. He's not a great leader, or commander among the people. But instead they find him out in the field taking care of the sheep. He had never fought in a battle before. He was considered a nuisance by his older brothers, not even a part of the king's army. And yet, David would become one of the greatest leaders to rule over God's people.

Conrad Harkrider  13:45
And we could talk about Gideon and his 300 men, or Naomi, who lost her husband and her two sons. And how God brought her she was able to come back to the land and receive the blessings from God with her adopted daughter, Ruth. And then of course, there were the 12 men who were uneducated and untrained. And yet through their work, the 12 apostles were able to take the message about Jesus to the entire world. You see, the Lord delights to use improbable situations to fulfill his plans. And why does he do it that way? Why doesn't he just use the best, the brightest, the most educated people to fulfill His purposes? It's because it's because when we are weak, when we are vulnerable, and we have to rely on the Lord. It shows His power, His strength shining through, it's clearly evident to all those who see the outcome that this could not have been by a man's doing that this was only because of the grace And the power of the Lord. And so when we start to feel weary when we start to have feelings of doubt, when we think I can't do this, I'm not strong enough, I'm not able to go on. We need to focus not on our failings, but on the strength of the Lord. These examples in scriptures, they help us to understand that, that no matter what our situation is, God can take those things and use it for something good. our effort, our strength, we only have so much it can only go so far. But God can sustain us and cause us to do far more than we ask or think. If we rely on his strength, and His Spirit, also knows what he says in verse seven here, he says, Who are you? Oh, great mountain before Zerubbabel, you shall become a plane, and he shall bring for the topstone amid shouts of grace, grace to it. Secondly, we see that in order to build the temple, we need to look past the challenges. He asks a question in verse seven, speaking to a mountain. He says, Who are you? Some translations say, what are you? The largest and most impressive mountain in the state of Washington is Mount Rainier. Maybe some of you have been there to see it. It is over 14,000 feet high, it's covered in ice and snow year round, it is considered to be an active volcano. It's impressive. Can you imagine if you're driving through the national park there and he ran into one of the locals? And you pointed out and you said, What is that thing over there? What is that? What do you people call that right there? Well, that wouldn't make any sense. Even if you didn't know the name of what it was referred to, you would understand that this is a daunting and impressive mountain peak. But yet, that's what the Rumble is going to do here. This mountain, this massive obstacle in front of him, he's going to ask the question, what is this?

Conrad Harkrider  17:28
Who is this? It will seem as nothing before him, verse seven, says that it's going to become the mountain will become as a plane. How is that possible? Well, the mountain represents an incredible challenge that was before the people. It represents all this, the struggles, the hardships, the obstacles that they were going to have to overcome, to be successful for the Lord. And how is it that they're going to do this to complete this building project? What does God say? They're going to have to look past the mountain. They're gonna have to see beyond the current trial in order to continue building for the Lord. In Matthew chapter 17, in verse 20, Jesus said, For truly I say to you, if you have faith, like a grain of mustard seed, you will say to this mountain, move from here to there, and it will move and nothing will be impossible for you. Jesus assures the disciples that if they will walk in faith, things that seem to be too big to accomplish, will suddenly become their present reality. He says, nothing. Nothing will be impossible for you. When I was in high school, one of my neighbors needed some gravel to be spread around the garden in their backyard. And he asked me if I wanted to make some money, and I said, Yes. When I showed up at his house, there was a large pile of rocks that had been delivered and dumped in the driveway. And I thought to myself, there's been a mistake here, because he wants this in the backyard, not in the front. There was a wheelbarrow sitting next to the pile. Come to find out my job was to get those rocks in the wheelbarrow into the backyard. How do we approach a obstacle? That seems insurmountable. Something like taking the gospel to the entire world, teaching the city of Nashville about Jesus Christ. When we focus our eyes on the on the problem. When we see the huge pile of rocks, it seems daunting, it seems like we'll never be able to make any problem progress. But how do you climb a mountain? How do you lift a pile of rocks, you do it one step at a time. One shovel at a time you teach one person at a time, you focus on what's in front of you, the things that you can control the people in your circle, and you leave the rest to the Lord. walking in faith, knowing that it's not our ability, it's not about us saying the perfect words, and always having the right thing to bring up. But trusting the Lord to do the heavy lifting, and knowing that he can move even the greatest obstacles that may be in front of us. Jesus said, that we shouldn't be anxious about tomorrow. Because there's enough to worry about in this day that today has its own troubles and its own worries. Tomorrow, the anxieties and the worries of tomorrow are sufficient for those things can be left for another time.

Conrad Harkrider  21:09
And so God is able to take that mountain, whatever it is, and turn it into a plane, do we trust Him on that? Do we believe that he is capable of turning that mountain that obstacle into a plane? Also, notice verse nine. In verse nine, he says, the hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of his house, his hands shall also complete it, then you will know that the Lord of hosts has sent me to you. To continue building the Lord's house we see here that we need to trust in His promises. Trust in his promises, the Lord tells servable that just as he has laid the foundation of the temple, as read chapter three and verse 10, so he is going to complete this great work. This would be assigned to everyone. That Zachariah prophet is real, that he is speaking on behalf of the Lord because his word is going to come to pass just as he has said, this would come to completion. But when the Lord tells us that something is going to happen, that he's going to do something for us. That's, that's a promise we can rely on. We can trust in His Word. And in a world that's filled with so many uncertainties, so many things that are unknown. So many broken promises. God's word stands in contrast to those things because his word is faithful. It's sure it's dependable, it can be trusted. A number of years ago, we went to Mammoth Cave up in Kentucky when we first moved to Nashville. Mammoth Cave is said to be the longest cave system in the entire world. Very impressive. But when we went on the tour, one of the things they did when we went down into the main cavern is they shut off all of the lights, so that you could see how dark it was so dark that you cannot even see a hand in front of your face. And after a couple of seconds standing in that darkness, I was ready for them to turn the lights back on waiting for them to turn them back on. But after that experience, I thought about all of the explorers, people who had gone into the cave hundreds and 1000s of years before without electricity, carrying a lantern or a torch, and how they must have held on to that light as if their life was depending on it. You see, God's promises are like a blazing lantern. In the midst of a dark world, there are so many things that we can't control but his promises His word, it gives us clarity gives us perspective helps us to see what's what's real, what's meaningful, what's most important. And if we're going to continue working and serving and helping others if we're not going to lose our faith and become discouraged. We have to hold on to those promises. Keep them in front of us. Keep them at the front of our minds and our hearts things like I will never leave you or forsake you. Or I will not allow you to be tempted beyond what you're able. Or that the blood of Jesus Christ washes away all sins, those in the past and in the present or that if we are faithful unto death, God will give us a crown of life. You see, when we remember those promises, it helps us to keep our eyes focused on God that God is bigger than any trial or difficulty that we face in this life and that he is capable of delivering us, both in this time and the time to come. You remember what Joseph told the children of Israel just before he died, he told them that he wanted them to take his bones and carry them out of the land of Egypt. Joseph wasn't just concerned about his burial location. But instead, he was looking forward to the promise that had been made the promise to Abraham, that God would one day bring his people out and bring them into a land that he was going to give them. It was a promise that it was made hundreds of years prior, it was a promise that Joseph himself would not live to see.

Conrad Harkrider  26:07
And yet he still trusted that God would be faithful. And God is always faithful. In Deuteronomy, chapter seven, in verse nine, it says, Know, therefore that the Lord your God, is God the faithful God who keeps covenant and steadfast love with those who love Him and keeps his commandments, to 1000 generations. That's something that we can entrust our entire lives to. You can't find anything in this world with that type of assurance, trusting in his promises. And finally, notice what he says in verse 10. In verse 10, he says, Whoever has despised the day of small things shall rejoice, and shall see the plumb line in the hand of the rubble. To continue building we must rejoice in the small things. He says that there were some who despise the day of small things. As for chapter three and verse 12, tells us that when the foundation of the temple was laid, there were shouts of joy, great joy, but there are also the sounds of mourning, people who are weeping and crying. And the reason for that was because there was older men, some of the priests who had seen the first temple they knew the, the glory of the First Temple. And so to see this very modest structure that was now being built in its place, it brought feelings of great sorrow, and remorse. Many would have seen this new temple and considered it to be nothing impressive, it would have been a small thing, but God tells Zachariah that those who were despising or looking down on the small things they would one day they would soon rejoice. You know, there's some things in God's kingdom that can seem so insignificant. They're small things. Have You Ever Have you ever found yourself saying something like, we only had one visitor today, or there were only two kids in the Bible class, just to you know, nothing to get really excited about just two children learning about God's word. And so our perspective is, is big numbers and things that are, are exciting and cause for lots of celebration. But we need to rejoice in the small things. In God's Kingdom, the small things turn out to be big things. If you help one person, one child gain a better understanding of God's word grow in their relationship with the Lord does that is that meaningful? Does that make a difference? If you have a positive impact on one co worker, developing a relationship, setting an example helping them in their walk, does that make a difference? We don't know how many people and n is taught. We don't know how many sermons he preached, or if he traveled all over the world delivering God's message. But we know that he went to that house in Damascus. And he spoke the word of God to a man who was troubled and in desperate need of the Lord. We also know that the apostle Paul would go on to preach God's word to hundreds if not 1000s of people. But it started with Anna NYAS. We need to see the small things even if we help one person. Those can become great blessings, things to rejoice in in the kingdom of God. There's work to be done. Jesus said that the fields Are whites. There's so many opportunities and needs around us. But in order to build God's temple we need to rely on his strength. See, pass the challenges, trust in His promises and rejoice in even the smallest blessings that God will give us great progress to do this work. We're gonna close with the song this morning. If there's something that we can do to encourage or help you, in your walk with Christ, please come down to the front make it known as together we stand in seeing
