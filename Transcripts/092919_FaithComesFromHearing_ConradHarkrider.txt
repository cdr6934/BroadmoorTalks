What a blessing it is to be together on the first day of the week, not just this group meeting, but throughout the world, God's people are coming together in order to worship and to study and to reflect on all the blessings that God has given to us. I want to invite you to open up your Bibles to Romans, the 10th chapter. We've been studying from the book of Romans, in our Wednesday night class, and we're going to look at a section from Romans chapter 10, for the rest of our time this morning.

Conrad Harkrider  00:48
Last weekend, my wife took a trip down back down to Texas to visit some of her friends and family. And she left me with the three kids. And I'm thankful to report that my wife had a great trip. And then all three kids are still alive and with us here today. But watching the kids, there were several realizations that I had not lessons, I think I already knew these things, but they were things that I remembered. And that became even more apparent, first of all, kids are a tremendous blessing. Now may not, you may not have thought I was gonna start with that. But they are a blessing, just being around them and getting to see their perspective and the way they think about the world. And the way that they approach things. They're so innocent. One of them told me that she was so excited because, quote, I get to be the line leader tomorrow. And they just appreciate the little things. Kids are incredible. Number two, kids are exhausting. I was physically mentally, emotionally drained. And that was after only 30 minutes of being with them. And I now understand why my wife drinks coffee by the gallon. It is a survival tactic. But they are exhausting. They require a lot out of you when you're with them. Number three kids are really smart. I was amazed at how much I was relying on them. I have no idea where the band aids are, or what people are supposed to wear, or what goes in their lunches. They were helping me with all of that, which is probably why a lot of outfits came out mismatch. But you know, we still made it out. We were still here. And then finally, it is imperative that kids be able to listen, there were times when I would be saying things like let's go to the car, or you need to put your shoes on or you need to do this. But nothing was happening. And a kids are not listening. If they're not paying attention. If they're not hearing, then things can go from bad to worse really quick. Well, that's what I want to talk about this morning. This idea of hearing and listening. It's not just a skill that's critical and vital for children. It's important for all of us. And Paul says in Romans chapter 10, in verse 17, that hearing and listening is the means by which a person can come to faith. A person acquires or begins their faith, their walk with Christ. It starts with hearing the Word of God. Read with me in Romans, chapter 10, beginning in verse eight, as we think about this concept of faith coming from hearing, Romans 10, beginning in verse eight. It says, but what does it say? The word is near you in your mouth and in your heart. That is the word of faith that we proclaim. Because if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved. For with the heart one believes and is justified and with the mouth, one confesses and is safe. For the scripture says everyone who believes in him will not be put to shame. For there is no distinction between Jew and Greek. For the same Lord is Lord of all the sowing his riches on all who call on him. For everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved. How then will they call on in a call on him in whom they have not believed? And how are they to believe in him of whom they have never heard? And how are they to hear without someone preaching? And how are they to preach unless they are sent? As it is written? How beautiful are the feet of those who preach the good news, but they have not all obeyed the gospel. For Isaiah says, Lord who has believed what he has heard from us. So faith comes from hearing and hearing through the word of Christ.

Conrad Harkrider  05:13
In the section that we just read, it begins and ends with a focus on the word. Notice in verse eight, he says, the word is near you, that it is in your mouth in your heart, that is the word of faith, the word of faith. And then Skipping down to verse 17, he says, So faith comes from hearing and hearing through the word of Christ. Paul's entire ministry was devoted and centered upon sharing and spreading this word, he understood the importance of it. He understood the significance that in order for people to develop their own faith and to be saved, they had to hear this message, they had to receive this news about Jesus. He gives us some insight into what this message is, in verse nine. He says that if you confess with your mouth, that Jesus is Lord and believe in your heart, that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved. First of all, notice, when we think about this idea of faith, Paul says that we must confess with our mouth, and believe in our hearts, hearing the word doesn't just leave a person knowing some facts or information, but rather there is a response. There is a reaction to this message that we see. Notice what it is that people are hearing. He says, in first verse nine, that they needed to hear that Jesus is Lord. This was part of the message that was being proclaimed. And this is what people would confess with their mouths, what they would believe in their hearts that Jesus is the King and the ruler. But this is not just some philosophical or abstract idea that He is the ruler, but this is personal. He is the ruler of my life. And we submit and follow His guidance. Young people often have this feeling when they're getting ready to graduate from high school or move out of the house, that they are ready to be on their own. They're ready to make their own decisions, they're ready to call their own shots. And I can remember feeling that way, kind of butting heads with my parents and thinking, I want to do things my way I want to, I want to run things the way I think they should be run. Of course, after we get out on our own, and we start to pay bills and be in the real world, we kind of look back at some of the things that mom and dad were saying and realize, they kind of knew what they were talking about. They were telling me the truth. But this idea of independence, of wanting to be my own person, when we come to Jesus Christ and confess Him, when we confess with our mouth, we're not just saying his name, we're not just professing that he is a person and that he is a lord. But rather, we are saying that He is our Lord, we are acknowledging that he is the master and ruler of our lives. And in a sense, we are giving up our independence. We are laying aside our rights, and our will and our desire. And we're saying now, Lord, You are in control, you're the one that's going to direct and guide and move my life. My pursuits are now secondary, to your will. And so practically, what that means is that if there's a if there's a job that I'm about to take, and I'm looking at that and the situation I'm going to be in, it's not, I'm not going to take that job, if it doesn't align with his will. If there's a relationship that I'm engaging in, or a person that I'm getting close to, if it's not a relationship that would be pleasing or acceptable to God, and that's not something I'm going to engage in. Because now when I confess that Jesus is Lord, I'm so completely submitting my will, to his. The second part of this message is that God raised Him from the dead. He says that we believe in our heart that God raised Him from the dead. That's the message that people have to hear God raised Him from the dead. Jesus was a real person.

Conrad Harkrider  09:48
He was a real person who lived. He was crucified and after three days, God raised Him from the dead if we don't believe in the resurrection, if that's not a real historical event, And then our faith and our religion are, they're useless, they're meaningless. The resurrection gives significance and importance to our faith. It is the proof. It is the proof that God gives to the world that the things that these men were saying, the things that we read in these letters are true and verifiable, that these men, Paul and the apostles, and the other men were not just out to make a name for themselves, they were just trying to sell copies of a book, but rather, they were I witness. They were eye witnesses, and they were giving this solemn testimony of the things that they had seen. When a person hears this message that Jesus is the Lord that God raised Him from the dead, what are they supposed to do with it, he says, that in light of that, we are to confess with our mouth, and believe in our hearts. Confession is the mouth represents the center of our conviction. You talk about the things that are important to you speak about the things that are first on your mind, you affirm the things that you believe in. If there is a product that you think is incredible. And you think it has a lot of benefits and value, what do you typically do you tell others about it, you support it, in your words, you affirm it, you say things like, when you're around people, you say this shaving cream is the best, you should try it, and you promote it. You see this on social media all the time, people talking about this makeup, or this weight loss program that has totally changed their lives, they're confessing something that they believe in. This idea of confession is not just that we say something, but it is a reflection of our deepest convictions. It's just now what's in our heart is now coming out it's being professed, through our mouths. Notice where also where this belief originates, where it starts, he says from the heart. This comes from the heart, our heart represents the core of our emotions and our convictions. Our deepest passions and desires are inside of our heart. God talks about loving Him with all of our hearts, and our souls and our strength. Our service and commitment to God has to come from the heart. You know, God was never interested in people who just served based on external appearances. God has never looking for people who would just go through the motions who would do a certain list of things, but yet, their, their hearts and their convictions were not in it. And what that means is that we can go to church or we can give money or we can offer a hug or a smile. But if it doesn't come from the heart, then it's not meaningful. In Romans chapter two, Paul talks about this, about what it really means to be a Jew. What was God concerned with? When he called this special group of people, the children of Abraham to become his holy nation. He says, For no one is a Jew who is merely one outwardly, that is the things that you wear, the way that you do your hair, or cut your beard, or even circumcision or the things that you eat. He says, nor is circumcision outward and physical, but a Jew is one inwardly. And circumcision is a matter of the heart by the Spirit, not by the letter. His praise is not from man, but from God. The emphasis is not on being pleasing to others ought to be accepted by men by the things that they can see. But rather there should be a true conviction in the heart. These actions, of confessing and believing must be rooted from deep within us. I want to suggest to you and I want to ask, is this just a one time action? Is this a one time thing that someone confesses the Lord and they believe in their heart that Jesus was raised from the dead? These verses are, these verses are often used to talk about when a person is saved, when they come to Christ and certainly come into Christ requires us to believe that he is, Lord, that the fact about the resurrection is true. But what about the rest of our lives?

Conrad Harkrider  14:49
If I said you, if you get into the lifeboat, then you will be saved. their safety, their security inside of that boat. What happens If you decide to get out, what happens if you feel like the lifeboat just isn't your thing, or that you think that there's no longer any purpose or meaning or significance to it, and you decide to go a different direction, you're now putting yourself in harm's way. You see confession and acknowledging Christ as our ruler is a, that's a lifelong process. That's a continual journey. And the the first day that we confess Christ, we may have been very immature, our understanding might have been very cloudy. But this is a journey that we grow in, we mature we got we gained strength and confidence and understanding of what it means that Jesus is the ruler of of our lives, and the significance that God raised Him from the dead. And that's something that we shouldn't just think about one instance in our life, but rather, that is our walk. That's our way of life, our way of living. If we stopped believing or confessing, if we get out of the lifeboat, then we're at risk of drifting away. In Romans chapter 11. In verse 20, Paul gives this warning, he says, this is that is true, they were broken off because of their unbelief. But you stand fast through faith. He's talking about the Jews and how God had removed them from the tree because of their unbelief. And he's addressing the Gentiles. And he's using this as a point of warning, as an example. He says, so do not become proud, but fear. For if God did not spare the natural branches, neither will he spare you. This is a warning to say that, if God can remove his special people, Israel because of their unbelief, he can do the same to those who have now come to Christ, through the blood and the sacrifice of Jesus, Jesus Christ, the Gentiles who have now come into the family. And so the warning for us is to remain faithful to keep confessing, to keep believing in our hearts, so that we can be saved. Also, notice what he says in verse 12. He says in verse 12, for there is no distinction between Jew and Greek for the same Lord is Lord of all bestowing his riches on all who call on him. In regards to hearing this message in regards to coming to Christ, He says in verse 12, that there is no distinction. This is one of the major themes in the book of Romans. And it's the fact that God has extended his salvation, not just to a specific group of people, not just to the descendants are the children of Abraham, but God has now offered this to all people. In chapter three, he talks about Romans three talks about how all have sinned, both Jews, and Greeks. But now, the good news of the gospel is that despite our failures and our rebellion, our rejection of God, he has offered grace and mercy to all people that we can be justified or declared righteous or innocent, or blameless, rather, through the sacrifice of Jesus Christ. There is no distinction. You know, under the old law, there was a distinction. There was a difference between Jew and Gentile, the Jews had special requirements. They had a special law that they followed, they ate certain types of food, there were specific feasts that they engaged in, they, they lived differently, they they interacted differently with the world. Gentiles weren't allowed to come into the assembly to worship God, there was a separation there in order to come into the presence of a holy God, but this offer to receive and hear the message of Jesus Christ. Notice what he says in verse 11. He says, For the scripture says, everyone who believes in him will not be be put to shame. What What does? What does everyone include? Who's included in everyone?

Conrad Harkrider  19:38
Everyone, right, everyone and any qualifies it with everyone who believes anyone who's willing to accept this message. God doesn't pre select certain individuals. God doesn't say this person can be saved and this one is going to be lost, but instead he is offered this good news, this message of salvation to every person who is living today, we see that throughout the book of Romans and Romans chapter one, as he opens up his letter, he says, For I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power of God, the power of God for salvation to everyone. It is given to everyone who believes to the Jew first and also to the Greek. Jesus was born as a Jew, Jesus lived around the Jews, Jesus and His ministry was directed primarily at the Jews. But his intention was not just for his sacrifice and his his grace to be extended only to the Jewish nation, but rather, this message would be taken first to the Jew, and then would be spread to all the nations. There is no distinction between Jew and Greek. What are some of the implications of this? He says, also in verse 12, he says, there's no distinction for the same Lord is Lord of all. The same Lord is Lord of all Jesus is the Lord of all people, people who are rich people who are poor, black and white, educated or uneducated, whatever type of lines that we might draw in our society, how are we segregate or divide people? Jesus has no barriers, he crosses over between cultures, between languages between countries. He is Lord of all he's Lord of Americans. He's Lord of South Americans, Central Americans, Canadians. He's Lord of people who live in China and India, and Russia, and Africa and all over this earth. Jesus is Lord of all. And that's important for us to remember and not to think of Christianity in terms of something that belongs to us, something that that we have that's exclusive. It's becoming more and more common today for people to think, in those terms, that Christianity is kind of a Western way of doing things. And Jesus is for the Christians. And Muhammad is for the Muslims. And Moses is for the Jews and whatever area of the world that you live in, you sort of have these religious beliefs, but they all sort of tie back in to the same God. But that's not what Paul is saying here. Jesus is the only option to have a relationship with God. You notice that he is the same Lord of all, there's no distinction. And that's why it's so critical for people to hear the word for us not to be content just to say, well, there's a big group of us. But rather, this message is imperative. For all people, Jesus is God's offer of salvation to the world. Also, notice in verse 14, in verse 14, Paul begins asking a series of questions. He says, how then will they call on him? In whom they have not believed? And how are they to believe in Him and whom they have never heard? And how are they to hear without someone preaching? And how are they to preach unless they are sent? He walks through this for this progression here. And essentially, he's saying how can someone call on God unless people are sent?

Conrad Harkrider  23:49
And he walks through this, these steps here about explaining how a person can come to faith? How can a person begin a relationship a connection to God, the end goal is to call upon the Lord. But in order for that to happen, a person has to first believe they have to accept this message. They can't believe unless they hear they can't hear unless someone preaches. And people can't preach unless they are sent to call upon the Lord is the ultimate goal. That's the destination and what does that really mean? This is a quote from the book of Joel Joel chapter two and verse 32. It's also quoted, Peter uses it in his sermon on the day of Pentecost in Acts chapter two, when he says that those who call upon the name of the Lord will be saved, to call upon God's name. That's not just merely to say, save me Lord, or I call upon your name. But instead this carries with it the idea of submission to genuinely and completely entrust oneself To the Lord, to acknowledge that he has the power, and that we have to submit to His will. As we said previously with confessing and believing this, these are not one time things that we in a moment in life call upon God but rather this is a a way of Christian living we call we rely we entrust ourselves to the mercy and grace of God. Notice that each of these steps is critical. If you get one of them out of order, if you leave one of them out, it messes up the whole function. What happens if there is a building that is on fire? What if someone sees the smoke, what do they do? They alert the people that are around them. And then if there's a fire alarm, they pull the alarm, the alarm sounds, and then everyone who's in the building now hears this warning. And if you've ever been in one of those drills, or the real thing, you know how that piercing sound, it almost chatters your teeth, kind of forcing you to the exits. But then people respond to that warning. They head towards the doors and they reach a point of safety until the fire department arrives. What happens if one of those pieces is missing? What if no one sees the smoke? What if they see the smoke, but they don't alert anyone? They don't tell anyone else? What if they pull the alarm and it starts going off? But the people who are hearing it don't respond? They don't listen, they don't take action? Or what if they hear the alarm, and they begin to respond, but they go the wrong way they go the wrong direction, they head upstairs instead of down out to the exit all of those scenarios end in disaster. And that's why it's essential or critical for each one of these steps to be in place. Do you see that there is nothing supernatural going on here. There's nothing miraculous, there's no heavenly vision or encounter. That's bringing a person to faith. It's fairly simple. A person who has the word delivers it to those who don't have the word, they are able to hear it, understand it, believe it. And that person is ultimately say, faith is not some mystical concept. It is the product of the Word of God being spoken. And that's what Paul emphasizes here, this chain or this progression. And that's why it's so important for us to get the word out to get the message out so that others can hear in verse 15. Paul quotes from Isaiah 52 And verse seven. He says, how are they to preach unless they are sin? As it is written? How beautiful are the feet of those who preach? The good news? How beautiful are the feet of those who preach the good news? If I was to ask the high school class here?

Conrad Harkrider  28:16
What are the top 10 professions that a person could have? What do you think would be on that list? Professional athletes, musician, artists, entrepreneur, accountant and preacher of the gospel. You know, we don't think about it in those terms. We don't sometimes we don't esteem this work in that way. But yet Paul says that this is special. This is a special God given task. And it's essential that we have men who are trained and equipped to be able to teach and speak God's word to deliver this message to others. And so I want to challenge us to think about do we value and appreciate the preaching and teaching of God's Word? Have we cultivated an environment where that is something that is elevated, that it is prize, that is a skill that is desired, and looked upon with great admiration. One of the things that Frederick gray highlighted when he was here with us last week, was all of the different people that had played a role in helping him to grow in his faith, and encouraging him to get where he was. And what was interesting as many of those may it seemed to me that many if not all of those were outside of his immediate family. There were brothers and sisters in Christ who took a vested interest in a young man and a new Christian, to help him to grow and his faith and in particular to consider speaking and teaching and preaching God's word. It takes All kinds of people to plant that seed to encourage, to help motivate someone to think about serving God. In this way, you know, the first Adult Bible class that I ever taught, was not not the result of me volunteering. But rather someone came to me and asked, Hey, will you teach this class? And I kind of looked at them like deer in the headlights, like, What do you mean, me teach? The first time I gave I stood up to give an invitation was not the result of me saying, hey, I can do this. I've got this. But it was the scheduler guy who put my name on the list. And all of a sudden, I realized next week I was up. I think my older brother wrote the whole thing for me, handed it to me and just said, Here, get up there. But all along this journey, there are people who can step in, and help us, encourage us, and at times progress in the right direction. And it's so important because how can people hear how can they hear if they're not sent? What is the outcome of these people preaching and teaching? Some will hear some will believe some will accept. But notice what verse 16 says, he says, not all have obeyed the gospel. For Isaiah says, Lord who has believed what he has heard from us.

Conrad Harkrider  31:33
He says that not all have obeyed. Not everyone will accept not everyone will listen and heed this word. And that's important for us to think about and to remember that even when the Apostle Paul was delivering God's divine revelation to the world, he was an eye witness of the resurrected Lord. And yet people still didn't accept his message. In the same way, we shouldn't be surprised or discouraged. Or we shouldn't give up hope, or get frustrated. To the point of quitting. When people don't accept this message, it doesn't mean that God's word has failed, it doesn't necessarily mean that we've done something wrong. But rather, this is a message that will divide people, some will accept it and some will not. Notice in verse 16, he says, that not all have obeyed the gospel. And then he quotes from Isaiah. And he says, in later in the, in the verse he said, Lord, who has believed what he has heard from us, I just want to briefly point out that in Romans Paul uses obedience and belief, interchangeably. He says that not all have obeyed, but then he switches and then he talks about them believing and those two things go together. They are parallel, they're consistent with one another. In Romans chapter one. In verse five, Paul begins the letter talking about the obedience of faith. In Romans chapter 16, in verse 26, when he concludes the letter, he talks about the obedience of faith. Faith is not just a mental thought that a person has but rather, it is a willingness to submit their their entire will and life to the Lord in obedience, to say to God, I'm going to do what you've said, and I trust you to take care of me. The truth is that not everyone is going to believe this message. And not everyone believed Jesus when he was here, in John chapter 12, and verse 42, it says, Nevertheless, many even have the authorities believed in him, but for fear of the Pharisees, they did not confess it, so that they would not be put out of the synagogue. These are people that had heard the message, but they weren't willing to confess it. They weren't willing to act upon it because of fear of what others might think. And so we can't allow this type of rejection to deter us. Jesus was rejected at Nazareth, but he continued on with his ministry, sharing the new the good news with open and honest hearts. Well, as we close this morning, I want to just leave you with this idea, and this truth that faith is not some mysterious and mystical, abstract concept. Faith is developed based upon the hearing, and believing of God's solid and unshakable shakable truths, God's word when a person accepts those things. And when we come to believe and know that these things are true, then it demands a response from us. In Acts chapter 22, as Paul is relating his conversion, he talks about how he was in Damascus waiting for someone to come to him and a man named Ananias came in and when he saw Paul, he said, Why are you waiting? Arise and be baptized and wash away your sins, and calling on the name of the Lord. If you haven't called upon his name, if you haven't submitted your life to God, we want to encourage you to take that step this morning, to be baptized to wash away your sins are begin that walk with the Lord, and there's something that we can do to encourage you. In your walk and your relationship with Christ. Please come down to the front as we stand and sing
