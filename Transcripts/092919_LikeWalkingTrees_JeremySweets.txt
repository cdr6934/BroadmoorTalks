Good evening. It's good to see everyone here today, I see that Miss Betty's not here. It's good to see you. If you're visiting with us. We appreciate very much your attendance and the fact that you're here to worship with us. We're going to open up our Bibles at this time and study from God's word unless that you turn to Mark chapter eight, verses 22 through 26, Mark eight, verses 22 through 26. When Jesus came to this earth, He preached the gospel, and he demonstrated the gospel in the power of God by performing miracles. I'd like to look at one of those miracles tonight and Mark eight and verse 22. says when they came to Bethsaida, and some people brought to him a blind man and begged him to touch him. And he took the blind man by the hand and led him out of the village. When he had spit on his eyes. He laid his hands on him, he asked him, Do you see anything? And he looked up and said, I see people but they look like trees walking. Then Jesus laid his hands on his eyes again. And he opened his eyes, his sight was restored, and he saw everything clearly. And he sent him to his home saying, Do not even enter the village. Jesus performed many miracles. But this one stands out a little bit as maybe something a little unusual, something that departed from the path which he normally took. And so it leaves me with some questions. Why did he do it this way? Why did he heal in two stages? Was Jesus not powerful enough to heal in one? Well, we know that's not the case, because normally he would simply heal somebody. There was not a fuzzy vision followed by a clearer vision. If he wanted to heal a blind man as he does elsewhere in Scripture, he would simply heal the man. So why does he do it in two stages here? Why does he do that? Why does he ask the question? Do you see anything asking as if his healing was effective? He doesn't seem to do that elsewhere, either. He simply heal someone, they go away rejoicing, and he will use that as an opportunity to teach them but here he says, Do you see anything? He says? Yes, I see. People, but they look like trees, walking. I'm not sure I have the answer to all of this. But that's really what I want to look at tonight and study. I think that Jesus was teaching us something through this miracle. And I think the fact that it was different is provides for us lessons that we can learn. And so that's what I want to get into tonight, I'd like to talk about, like, walking trees, like walking trees. I asked my family, I said, you know, I want to have a good intro like Conrad. That's always the goal. I never seem to make it. So you know, what can I use for walking trees? I was stumped. Which is why I simply started with the text. Simply started there and went there are poor song leaders as well. They often ask us, what are you preaching on? And Nick asked me, and I said, like walking trees. So he's trying to think of the walking tree songs, you know, and there are none, none that are there.

Jeremy Sweets  03:27
As we look at this text, I want to make an application as we think about this man looking at things like walking trees. And as we do that, I want to, before I answer the question, why this unusual miracle, maybe piece in some other elements of this as well. And so if we're to look at this section, we can see in Mark chapter seven, verses 31 through 37, there's actually a very similar miracle. That happens. Now, this is not a two stage miracle, but many of the exact same elements are found. It says in Mark seven, verse 31. Then he returned from the region of Tyre and went through side into the Sea of Galilee, in the region of the capitalists, and they brought to him a man who was deaf and had a speech impediment, and they begged him to lay his hands on him. And taking him aside from the crowd privately he put his fingers into his ears, and after spitting touched his tone, and he looked up to heaven, He sighed and said to him, If fatha that is be opened, and his ears were opened, his tongue was released, and he spoke plainly. Jesus charged them to tell no one, but the more he charged them, the more zealously they proclaimed it. You'll notice that a lot of the same elements are found here. Jesus normally performed His miracles in public so that others can see but here this one was in private, even when the man was brought to him, we see that he didn't Jesus just didn't come upon a man but others friends brought the one that needed healing to Jesus. And they asked him, Please touch him and heal him. Jesus again, he takes us out of the public sphere, and he brings this man into private, and he does heal him, giving him the ability to hear and the ability to speak. And also like Mark, chapter eight, Jesus says, Do not tell anyone. But that instruction is not heeded as they went about proclaiming what had happened in this miracle. So as I look at these two stories that have very similar components, very similar elements, it seems like there's a section here that is cordoned off by Mark. And so what is found in between, I think, is instructive and helpful for us to consider why this unusual healing of the blind man in chapter eight and verse 22. Well, what happens in between what happens in between, you can see at the beginning of Mark eight, is the feeding of the 4000, the feeding of the 4000. And it was at that time that Jesus took just a few loaves and bread, and he fed 4000 men besides the women and children, and they had an abundance of food leftover. Clearly, this was a miracle that no other could perform. This was something that came from God with just a few morsels, a few bites, he was able to feed the multitude, well, that caused people to think in fact, we, you would think that that was sufficient to show his power. But it says in verse 11, that the Pharisees came and began to argue with him, seeking Him, seeking from him a sign from heaven to test him. And Jesus sighs deeply says, Why does this generation seek a sign? I say to you, no sign will be given to this generation, nothing else other than what was occurring would be provided are given. Well, that then leads to a discussion where Jesus says to His disciples, watch out, he says in verse 15, watch out beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and the leaven of Herod. And notice what his disciples say in verse 16, they began discussing with one another, the fact that they had no bread. And Jesus aware of this said to them, Why are you discussing the fact that you have no bread? Do you not yet perceive or understand? Are your hearts hardened? Having eyes? Do you not see and having ears? Do you not hear? And do you not remember? When I broke the five loaves for the 5000? How many baskets full of broken pieces? Did you take up? They said, 12, and the seven for the 4000? How many baskets full of broken pieces did you take up? And they said to him seven? And he said to them, Do you not yet understand, you'll notice that the disciples had an understanding problem or a vision problem. That very much mimics the situation that we find with this blind man, you say they saw a lot, they were with Jesus, and they came to understand an awful lot, but there were still a lot that they missed. There are still many ways that they had cloudy vision. And so I think that Mark uses this account here to illustrate and Jesus hills in this way to illustrate for his disciples, this process that was taking place, he says, having eyes Do you not see and having ears, do you not here, not only do we find within this section, what is framed by these two miracles to to deal with this subject matter of seeing yet not seen. But this also looks forward to what happens in the next section, which really takes us through chapter eight, nine and 10, all the way up to the trial for entry in chapter 11. And so before it heads into this final week of Jesus, we see that all throughout these chapters, the disciples are lacking understanding. In almost every occasion, you see the disciples lacking understanding. And we could go through each one of those, you see that when it comes to the discussion of divorce, you see it one of those when they're calling the children in them, the disciples don't seem to understand. You see it on many occasions. But one of the greatest misunderstandings you see is regarding the Messiah. And in this section, you see three accounts, where Jesus says and tells His disciples that He is going to suffer and die. And just to illustrate this process of cloudy vision, followed by a clear vision.

Jeremy Sweets  09:58
Notice if you would what was To read this and Mark eight and verse 27, the first of these occasions. Mark has 16 chapters, this is really a central element, a central point of the whole book, who is Jesus? Well, we're going to answer that question. And Mark eight in verse 27. And Jesus went on with his disciples to the villages of seseri, of Philippi. And on the way he asked his disciples, Who do people say that I am? And they told him, John the Baptist, and others say Elijah, and others one of the prophets, and he asked them, But who do you say that I am? Peter answered him, You are the Christ, and he strictly charged them to tell no one about him. Jesus is the Christ. That statement is what we base our faith upon. It is that profession, that we also profess when we're baptized, it is that profession that we can give a hearty Amen to. Peter saw this clearly that me? Well, maybe not. If we keep reading, we see that Jesus began to expound upon the fact that he was the Messiah and what that meant. You'll notice that Peter, it says, took Him aside and began to rebuke Him, Lord, You are not going to suffer and die. I just declared you to be the Messiah, surely you are misunderstanding. And he began to rebuke the Lord. And Jesus said to Peter, in verse 33, Get behind Me, Satan, for you are not setting your mind on the things of God when on the things of man. Yes, Peter had vision here, didn't he? But it was cloudy vision. It was foggy vision. And it was filled with some misunderstandings. Now he would come to see more clearly. And as we unfold and head into x, we see that that site becoming more clear, but that's what I'd like to talk about tonight. What I find interesting about this is sometimes we talk about a lack of vision that the world has by not being able to see Jesus and who he is. But what I found interesting is that I think this was a lesson that Jesus was telling for his disciples. And by implication, it's what I want to tell to you that are members of the church are Christians. There may be some here that are not Christians. But if I'm talking here to Christians, we also can have vision problems, can we we can also have problems with our sites. And so I particularly want to talk to those that that have named Christ tonight. So what are some ways that we can have cloudy vision? What are some ways that we can have cloudy vision, we can be just like this man that sees walking trees sees in a blurry way. First of all, I believe that we can have what I might call cataracts from listening to the culture. You'll notice that Jesus warned His disciples about the leaven or the influence of the Pharisees and Herod, he was concerned that they would be overly influenced or influenced at all by these people, those that would seek signs those that would test Jesus and you notice that, that the Pharisees and Herod went about this in different ways. The Pharisees were the religious elite, they had all the answers, they were doing the right things, and they deny that Jesus was the Christ. They fought him tooth and nail. They didn't want to admit that he was the Christ, they had the power of the people, the the goodwill of the people, and they wanted to hold on to that. Herod, on the other side was a worldly man that tried to attain his power through force. And when he heard about

Jeremy Sweets  14:06
when he heard about the babies being born, we'll see that Herod and that that whole line of hairs really committed atrocities when Jesus was born. And we see that Herod tried to put to death, those that were two years and under. And so Jesus warns his disciples about the influence that they might have, and that that would be a way that they would have cloudy vision. It's also interesting the word that he uses 11 You know, sometimes I think that we say to ourselves, that the world will not influence me. But Jesus uses hear the words of leaven, what is 11? Do? It grows, doesn't it? It expands. And so it is when we allow the world to influence us. We might say, well, this is just a small amount. I read my Bible and I can counteract that in fluence what what the world seems to do with its values, its way of looking at things. What it holds important is it can get into our hearts and grow. And it becomes the same normal because we see all the media we see all the people and they think a certain way, not according to God's word. And that can begin to grow, it can begin to see normal out in the world. That's why everybody views this, the world tells us and that leaven can grow and spread. And I think that that can create for us some cataracts are clouding vision that will compromise compromise our clear vision, which we need to be influenced by God and His Word, that should be the primary the moving force of our thoughts. But far too often we let the world have an influence. In Proverbs 13, in verse 20, it says, whoever walks with the wise becomes wise, but the companion of fools will suffer home. In the New Testament, the book of James and chapter four, in verse four, he says, Do you not know that friendship with the world is enmity with God, therefore, whoever wishes to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God. Far too many Christians want to have it both ways. I want to say I'm following God, but also want to be a friend of the world. And James tells us very clearly, you can't have it both ways. You can't give your allegiance to God and the world at the same time, you have to make a choice. And so let us make a choice for clear vision by choosing to follow after God and His Word. We also may have night blindness. Maybe these are four. So I don't know I'm trying to use the vision analogy here. At night, night blindness is when you simply cannot see what is out there. You have a problem because of the the the night there the the darkness, and then when light would come in, it's very blinding. I think that many Christians can dismiss or minimize sin, and they have a blind spots to sin in their lives. And that can be very dangerous. Christians say it's not that big a deal. You know, it's almost sounds like an addict with drugs doesn't, it's not that big a deal. It doesn't control me, I control it, I can choose the stuff whenever I want. This is not that harmful, I have control over it. Those are all wise isn't it? We don't have control over sin. Sin controls us when we allow it to when we give into it. We're not in control. We're giving that up. We're following after. After what is harmful to us. We may minimize sin in our words and our actions. But that is to our own detriment. If you have night blindness and you're out, you can fall into trouble despair. You can fall prey to the things that happen at night. And so it is for a Christian who would minimize sin, dismiss sin and simply take it into their lives. In Second Peter to verse 22, we see no minimizing a sin whatsoever. But it shown to be a vile picture. It says the true proverb says what has happened to them, the dog returns to its own vomit, the sow after washing herself returns to wallow in the mire. The context of this passage is talking about Christians that would return again to the world and to sinful living. Is that a big deal? Is that a promise? Or is that a problem?

Jeremy Sweets  18:53
I should say? Well, Peter says that's just like a dog returning to its own vomits. Now that's not something you talk about in polite company, right? I can hear my mom rebuking me if I were to talk about that at the table. We don't talk about the it's not appropriate. That's a disgusting picture isn't? Well, I think that's exactly why Peter use that. Going back to sin is a disgusting picture. It is disgusting. It's like a pig. You wash the pig. Look at my nice clean pig. I don't have any pigs. But if I did look at my nice clean pig, that pigs gonna go right back to wallowing in the mire, and be nasty. That's what it's like to return to sin. And that is dangerous, that is harmful. And Hebrews chapter six verses four through six and a similar discussion about going back to sin. There the passage tells us that we do not have another sacrifice. Christ has already died for us and we cannot crucify him. Again, it says in verse six, that those that do that are doing that to their own harm in holding him of Jesus Christ to contempt. And so we see that going back to sin and minimizing sin is dangerous. And this happens to Christians. And that's why we need to be careful about it. Why does not have cloudy vision and see men walking like trees, but let us develop clear vision in this matter. Another problem is not just minimizing sin in general, sometimes we see sin is serious, but we only see it as serious in other people. We only see that and other people. You know, when I think back to the disciples, there's really two reactions I have. And before we get to this point, talk about a related thing connected to this text. One is how could the disciples be so? Shallow, dense? How could they miss the point over and over and over again, you really are left scratching your head and saying they simply don't get it, do they? Jesus teaches them and they don't get it. The second thing I would say is, I am sure glad that my life is not being recorded. You know, it's easy to see where they missed it. But we often have a blindness to our own failings and problems. You know, it's easy to with disdain, those disciples were so slow, they should have understood that they should have seen that. But I guess the point of this whole lesson is to say that even as Christians as disciples, we can have cloudy vision. So we have to be careful about that we have to be watchful. Well, when it comes to this case, and Matthew chapter seven, we see that that we are warned against being judges of others. It's easy to spot sin and other people. Many times we can make lists of all the ways that this person or that person has failed, and not done what they were supposed to. But we are not so critical when it comes to our own lives. And Jesus warned us against that, in Matthew seven in verse one. Just not that you be not judged, for with the judgment you pronounce, you will be judged and with the measure you use, it will be measured to you. Why do you see the speck that is in your brother's eye but do not notice the log that is in your own eye? Or how can you say to your brother, let me take the speck out of your eye, when there is a log in your own eye? You hypocrite first take the log out of your own, and then you'll see clearly to take the speck out of your brother's eye. If you have a log log jammed vision, do you have a log in your eye there's gonna be problems with side isn't there. But often we have this big log this tree in our eye and we're looking for the speck in someone else's.

Jeremy Sweets  23:07
Now there is a way to lovingly help others with sin and address those things. But this is not a loving, caring concern and dealing with others in their sin and trying to help them. This is a judgmental, I'll help you but yet I have no problems attitude. This is the person that says everyone else needs to change but me this is the person that fails to look into his own heart and his own actions and evaluate whether he is living in sin or not. So let us not be like that. Let us not be hypocritical judges, but let it rather let us have clear vision. That means we're going to have to evaluate our own selves, doesn't it? Consider our own selves continually to think through those things. So let us not have log jammed vision. Let us also not be near sighted or have a near sighted view of life. Our life is very short. James tells us that and chapter four and verse 14, our life has been a mist that appears for a little time and then vanishes away. But yet, even though we have a short life, sometimes we look at things on even a shorter scale. We don't see things from an eternal perspective. We see things from a perspective of here and now. And that may involve things like chasing after sin because it gives us a quick piece of pleasure, quick pleasure and may involve things like failing to wait on the Lord to not considering that that evil will have its price to pay. Evil will be taken to account by Almighty God. All of those things are not things that will happen immediately. but they have to be seen within an eternal context, God will bring sin into account and injustice in the world and in our own selves. So let us not pursue sin or those things that are short term but let us pursue those things that that are from an eternal point of view. In Second Peter one, verses five through 10. There are many elements of growth that are provided there. In verse five. He says, For this reason, making every effort to supplement your faith with virtue and virtue with knowledge and knowledge was self control. And self control was steadfastness and steadfastness with godliness and godliness with brotherly affection and brotherly affection with love. Second, Peter, one and verse eight. Now, for a face qualities are yours that are increasing, they keep you from being ineffective or unfruitful in the knowledge or knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ. For whoever lacks these qualities is so near sighted that he is blind, having forgotten that he was cleansed from his former sin. That you catch that if you're not seeking to grow and the grace and knowledge of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ, then you are blind. So short sighted, so near sighted it says, so that you are blind and you have forgotten that you were CLIN just from your former sin. If we fail to grow, if we stagnate, if we turn back to sin, we forgotten what God accomplished for us when we were baptized. And so we need to have clear vision, and we need to grow, we need to grow. One other vision problem I see is, we have cloudy vision is when we put blinders on now for a horror show put blinders on because you don't want them to see everything around. But sometimes Christians put blinders on their own cells when they think about what God can do, and what God can accomplish. And we begin very, we come very pessimistic and say, God can't do this. And often we don't say it in that way. We'll say This just can't be done, or we think in small terms, but we serve a big God that can accomplish great things. And not only that, but he will use us to accomplish those things. That's his desire. We see in Ephesians chapter three and verse 20. He says, Now to Him who is able to do far more abundantly than all that we ask or think, according to the power at work within us. Here we see that God is able to do more than we can even imagine. Let us not be those that would limit God. Let us not be those that work with a defeated picture of God. Should we try to convert others? Well, I

Jeremy Sweets  28:02
guess, but it's not going to do any good. I mean, no one listens anyway, right? I think sometimes we can vote approach evangelism that way. It's, you know, I've asked a lot of people, no one's gonna respond. Well, that may have been true in the past, it may be true in the future. But let us understand that the word is powerful and effective, and it can have an impact upon hearts. That doesn't mean it always will. But let us not live with a defeatist attitude or mentality, or put God in a box and say that he can only do so much. No, our God can do a great amount. You'll notice that not only we do this, but Peter did this as well, Disney. He limited the Messiah when it came about talking about he limit Jesus as the Messiah. Yes, you're the Christ, but you're not going to die. You're not going to suffer. That's not to be what you are. And so he limited God, let us not make the same mistake that Peter did. So what can we do to develop clearer vision? What can we do to develop clear vision? Well, first of all, we need to pursue a practice pursuit of clear vision. I noticed in Conrad sermon this morning, and when he was talking about confessing, is that something we do only one time, and even use these words? I don't know if anybody else did, I knew my sermon topic. So that one really stuck out to me. He says, you know, you confess, but you may have cloudy he used the word cloudy this morning. You may have cloudy vision, you might not understand things. And so there is a growth process through why? Well, the same is really making much of the same point here. We must pursue clear vision and strive to grow strive to grow. confessing Christ living the Christian life is not a one time decision. It's an ongoing decision. That's that's honored of that commitment that we made. And so let us pursue clear vision. And Hebrews five and verse 14, it talks about those that were not teachers, but they should have been teachers, they should have been mature Christians and the Hebrew writer rebukes them talks about the fact that they were still on milk, which would have been for babies. And Hebrews Five, Verse 14, it says, But solid food is for the mature for those who have their powers of discernment, trained by constant practice, to distinguish good from evil. We see here a practice of discerning good and evil of practicing good of choosing what is good, there is growth and maturity that comes through this practice. So let us pursue clear vision by practicing these things. In Philippians, chapter four and verse eight. Finally, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is just whatever is pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is commendable. There is anything of excellence. If there is anything worthy of praise, think about these things. Let us grow in the grace and knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ, as it talks about in Second Peter, verse chapter one, let us focus on the things of God the things that are good, as it says in Philippians, chapter four and verse eight, the things that are true and right and just and commendable. Let us fill our hearts with those things, and focus on those things. So let us pursue clear vision. Secondly, let

Jeremy Sweets  31:57
us have patience, let us have patience. One of the things that amazes me in this text is the patience that Jesus demonstrated with his disciples that continually did not understand. But he was patient with them. He continued to teach, it continued to be kind of sometimes he was stern and spoke to them in a stern way, but he always came back to loving them and teaching them. We can learn a lot from our Lord in many ways. But in this way, in particular, we need the same kind of love and care for others. For our fellow believers, for fellow Christians, sometimes we say they should know that they should already know that or they shouldn't fall for this sin. Again, they've done that before. And often we're simply not patient with others when they have cloudy vision, when they have problems with being near sighted or limiting God, or falling into the trap of hypocrisy or minimizing sin, all of those vision problems. And we say you shouldn't be like that. Well, it's true. You shouldn't be like that, but let us be patient with others. In Second Timothy two, we see that Paul instructs Timothy about how he should be the Lord servant in regard to others, bringing people to the truth. He says in verse 24, and the Lord servant must not be quarrelsome, but kind to everyone able to teach, patiently enduring evil, correcting his opponents with gentleness, God may perhaps grant them repentance leading to a knowledge of the truth. This is how Timothy was supposed to act to those that are outside of Christ. But as I read through this, are Christians to act any less with their brothers and sisters in Christ, should they not also be those that are kind with each other, not quarrelsome, teaching, instructing, patiently, maybe sometimes enduring evil from fellow brother, seeking to help them overcome that, correcting them with gentleness? Yes, that should be the same thing that we do with our brothers and sisters in Christ. We should be patient, kind, and instructive. We also see in Ephesians, four verses one through three. There it says, are therefore a prisoner of the Lord urge you to walk in a manner worthy of the calling to what you have been called, with all humility, and gentleness, with patience, bearing with one another in love, eager to maintain the unity of the Spirit and the bond of peace. Oh, that that would describe our hearts here at Broadmoor. Each and every one of us as we work together in love. Let us be the people that live with humility, gentleness, patience, forbearance, eagerly maintaining the unity of the Spirit and the bond of peace. Let us be patient with our brothers and sisters in Christ. God has been patient with us, let us be patient with others. And so we must pursue clear vision we must be patient with others when they're when they are pursuing clear vision. But we also need to rely upon God. We need to go to Him in prayer. As Christians, we are dependent upon God's mercy, His grace and His goodness. And it's also true when it comes to spiritual vision. He has revealed His word and we must seek to understand it, to apply those things in our lives so that we not only have a mental understanding, but that guides our heart and our actions so that we live in a godly way. In James one in verse five, it says, if any of you lacks wisdom, let them ask God, who gives generously to all without reproach, and it will be given him. Let us ask for clear vision, to be able to see things the way we need, be able to see Christ in all his glory, and let that picture guide our lives. Yes, let us pray to Almighty God. In Ephesians, one verses 16 through 19, Paul says that he prayed for the Ephesians there and he did not cease to pray for them. And the reason he did this is so that God may give you the spirit of wisdom and of revelation in the knowledge of him, having the eyes of your heart enlightened, that you may know what is the hope to which he has called you. He wanted them to be enlightened with an understanding of who God is to have their their hearts and their eyes

Jeremy Sweets  36:45
to see clearly. And that should be our prayer for ourselves and for one another. So as we talked about, looking at things like trees walking, let us not have cloudy vision. But let us strive for clear vision. This sermon was directed toward those that are Christians, but I hope that if you're not a Christian, you would also consider the fact that you desperately need God. You need God to have your sins washed away. There's nothing you can do by yourself to remove sin. There's nothing you can do apart from God that will remove sin, you need him, and he sent his Son to die on the cross for your sins, so that you might believe that Jesus is the Christ, confess Jesus is the Christ, repent of your sins and turn away from them. And be baptized in the water for the forgiveness of your sins. That is the beginning point where you make a commitment to God to serve him all of your days. If you are a Christian, and you're not living as you should, you're living with cloudy vision and you need the prayers of the saints here. Don't be too proud to ask a fellow brother or sister in Christ for help for prayers, you can come forward and we'll do that as a congregation. Or you may want to do that privately asking the elders or any of the men or women here to pray for you. We're trying to all get to heaven. That's our goal. So let's do what we can to get there. There's any subject to the invitation, please come as we stand in scene at this time.
