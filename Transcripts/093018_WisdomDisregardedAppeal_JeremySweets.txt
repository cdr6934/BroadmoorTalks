I have a full crowd here today. It's always good to be able to gather together and worship our God. So I appreciate very much the fact that you are here with us this morning. One of the things I've always appreciated about being able to stand up before you is your attentiveness, your eagerness to hear God's Word preached. I know, most of you here, and I know your hearts and your desire to serve God, you meet on a regular basis, and you want to do what's right. In fact, there's a great encouragement as we gather in these walls with people have like precious faith, we believe the same thing that Jesus is the Christ, we have devoted our lives to that. And so there's something good about being able to gather together with people like that and worship. And as a preacher. It's a it's been encouraging, because I've received many encouraging remarks afterwards. And I know that you're listening when I'm saying, I'm doing my best to present God's word. And I know you're going to check me on that to make sure that I'm staying true to God's word. You know, that's a very different picture, though, than what we might envision as a street preacher. Who's not standing within walls and preaching to those of like precious faith preaching to those that agree and will offer encouragement that's a very different picture. Often, we think of the street preacher standing up and speaking and you see the hustle and bustle passing on by the Street Preachers often ignored. The street preacher is viewed with disdain. The street preacher is viewed as someone that is maybe little bit crazy. They don't have it all together. Why are they standing up saying this? They're not all together. The street preacher is someone that people simply wish was not there. A nuisance that at best, but simply crazy. At worst, a crazy lunatic Book of Proverbs, this street preacher is the depiction that we have in Proverbs chapter one. We have wisdom crying out in the marketplace, wisdom crying out in the streets, but wisdom being ignored. Open your Bibles if you would to Proverbs chapter one. And we're going to be looking at verses 20 through 33. Here we see wisdoms, this regarded appeal and hopefully we can learn something from this and be people that would regard wisdoms appeal. Notice if you would and Proverbs one and verse 20. And I'll be reading through verse 33.

Jeremy Sweets  02:50
Wisdom cries aloud in the streets in the market, she raises her voice. At the head of the noisy street she cries out at the entrance of the city gates she speaks how long Oh simple ones, will you love being simple? How long will scoffers delight in their scoffing and fools hate knowledge? If you turn it by reproof, Behold, I will pour out my spirit to you, I will make my words known to you, because I've called and you refused to listen, have stretched out my hand and no one has heated, because you have ignored all my counsel, and would have none of my reproof. I also will laugh at your calamity. I will knock when terror strikes. When terror strikes you like a storm and your calamity comes like a whirlwind. When distress and anguish come upon you, then they will call upon me but I will not answer. They will seek Me diligently but will not find me because they hated knowledge and did not choose the fear of the Lord would have none of my counsel and despised all my reproof. Therefore they shall eat the fruit of their way and have their fill on their own devices for the simple are killed by their turning away and the complacency of full destroys them. But whoever listens to me will dwell secure and will be at ease without dread of disaster. Notice as we walk through wisdoms appeal, we see first of all that there is a statement of listen up. Listen up in verses 20 and 21. You see the street preacher wisdom crying out in the street, wanting those that are around to listen to hear. This is one of the common components of wisdom. In fact, if you read through Proverbs, this is one of the messages Listen, listen up. Listen to what I'm saying. Wisdom always does good if it is receive. If it is her wisdom that isn't ignored does no good at all. Wisdom makes her appeal in the public square. Now this is leaving, or at least a different scene from Proverbs chapter one and verse eight. Often in Proverbs, you have something like this, it says, Here, my son, listen to my instruction. And you see a parent taking a child aside, maybe squatting down and getting on their level and saying, listen to me. Listen to me, in that home like setting and this is far different than that. This is far different. This is in the street corner, this is proclaimed. Listen, wisdom is readily available here. It's not some program that has to be purchased for 1999 Three easy installments. It's not somebody that's peddling something in the back alley that only a few have access to some kind of secret plan, something secret to by no wisdom is appealing to anyone and everyone that will listen, hear my message. Wisdom is making the appeal in the public square. Not only that, but then the question is how long? If you're familiar with the Scriptures, you know that this is a common question asked in scripture. But often the question is one in the face of oppression? How long will the wicked be able to continue? Notice that this is a similar question, but it's against those that are self imposing the wickedness upon themselves. It is against the oppression that is carried out against oneself. And the question in verse 22, how long Oh, simple ones? Will you love being simple? The people are slaves, to their own desires. And so the question is, how long will people commit in justices against God and against themselves? Oppression is occurring, and it's occurring against their own selves. Now, maybe this is a continuation from what we've seen the the setting is simply continuing on from that home scene when the father instructs his child, because part of the instruction there is Do not be enticed by sinners do not be enticed, when people desire to shed innocent blood when people are going about carrying out evil and the father instruct his son Do not be enticed by that. Here, it may be those simple ones there carrying that out. This may be to the group of evildoers here.

Jeremy Sweets  07:52
And the question Are is how long Oh simple ones. Notice that three groups are discussed. How long Oh, simple ones. Here we see simple ones as those that are naive. They're simple. They're foolish. They lacked sound judgment. There's two other groups as well. How long will scoffers delight in their scoffing? And so we see scoffers, those that are arrogant, those that are defiant. Those that laugh and mock sound judgment. But we also see again, the word fools, fools hate knowledge. These fools are those that are morally insensitive. They're practically fools by how they live and how they disregard God. Now, as I look at these three groups, not sure exactly if this is similar descriptions for the same group, but you'll notice the question is, how long Oh, simple ones will you love being simple? refers to the simple ones as in the second person there you but it talks about the scoffers and the fools in the third person, how long will they hate? So it may be that he's talking to these simple ones. But whatever the regard whether these are similar groups, or he's talking to the some simple ones, we see that it is those that have disregarded God, and the message is going out to them. How long? How long the question really asks How long until repentance occurs? How long until you turn away from being simple? How long do you stop doing what you're doing? And so the question is how long? Notice also that this question is ignored. The street preacher is does not receive an ear. People don't stop and listen and say I'd like to hear more they continue on by they're too busy to hear a message like that they're too engaged in their their own daily process their own affairs. Here's how to stop and listen to the preacher in verse 24. It says, because I called you and you refused to listen, stretched out my hand and no one has heeded. Verse 25 underscores the fact that they're ignored with two more statements, because you have ignored all my counsel, and would have none of my reproof. Do you see the repetition of the fact that wisdom is ignored? Wisdom has been refused. People won't stop. And listen. Wisdom has not been heated. People don't take it to heart. No, I get I get the sense when I'm going to the mall, see people trying to attack me hand me some kind of paper. And I just, I don't make eye contact. I keep going I keep moving. But here we say that it is wisdom that is being ignored. Wisdom is being refused. Wisdom is not being heated and people have none of it. Just like I don't want to I don't want to engage in that conversation or he'll hear the sales pitch at the mall. People are ignoring wisdom. We don't want to hear it. Not only is this wisdom ignored, but it's only ignored for a time. It's ignored when things are good. It's ignored when people have the opportunity to do whatever they want and they're not encumbered by they're not presented with the difficulties of life they've not had to eat or bear the fruit of their consequences. It's when people are are unaware or not paying attention to the future problems that ignoring wisdom we'll call it is then when it ignored but notice in verses 26 through 30, there will come a time when wisdom will be sought out by the simple ones. Notice in verse 26. I also will laugh at your calamity I will mark when terror strikes. When terror strikes you like a storm and your calamity comes like a whirlwind. When distress and anguish come upon you, then they will call upon me but I will not answer. They will seek Me diligently but will not find me because they hated knowledge and did not choose the fear of the Lord would have none of my counsel and despised all my reproof. Notice that there will come a time when wisdom is needed by those that have ignored it for so long. You see here a sense of desperation.

Jeremy Sweets  12:50
People follow the path of foolishness, and that leads somewhere. But as they're going along the path, skipping along the way, having fun, they don't see where it's headed. But the path of foolishness is headed in a harmful direction. And it's only when they see the end when they get toward the end when they've walked along that path for a long time. And they see it there that they began to holler out and cry out in desperation. I need help right now. I need it and then they begin to seek wisdom. But wisdom says I will not be able to help then you will have to bear your consequences. Wisdom has been ignored for too long. And now when you need it in desperation when it is requested, it will not be there. The reasons given we see in verse 29, and 30 it says because they hated knowledge. They wanted ignorance, they wanted self deception. And now they will bear those consequences. But also it says they did not choose the fear of the Lord. When we want to make ourselves master, when we want to serve ourselves as Lord, when trouble comes, we will see what kind of Lord we can be. God has all power and all my thing can deal with all problems but we are not capable like God. If we elevate ourselves to Lord, when we face the problems of life, we can't handle them can we make very poor Lords because we're not capable like Almighty God, we are not almighty like him we are not wise like he is. And so we see that the reason that it is this request is ignored at this time is because they hated knowledge and they did not choose the fee year of the Lord. Well, verses 32 and 33, or 31. Through 33. We see the consequences, the end of the path. And there are two paths that are presented in Proverbs and elsewhere in Scripture, there is the way of foolishness, the way of self service away against and away from God. But there is also a path of wisdom, a path that follows after God and His way. And notice here the two paths as they're set out, verse 31, therefore they shall eat the fruits of their way, and have their fill of their own devices, for the simple are killed by their turning away, and the complacency of full destroys them. But whoever listens to me will dwell secure and will be at ease without dread of disaster. How different can these two ways be? What a stark contrast? Here it says, of those that follow the fruit of their own way? It says that they are killed. That way leads to death. That way leads to destruction. It says the complacency of fools destroys them. That way leads to destruction that is far different than what we see in verse 33. That way, is one of terror, and fright, and instability and insecurity. But verse 33, says, But whoever listens to me will dwell secure and will be at ease. Do you see the difference in the two ways? Do you see the difference of the the end result to following these way? Those that listen to God will be without dread. They will be secure. They'll sleep well at night comfortable. But those that follow the other way on waking up every five minutes for fear for terror. They live in a nightmare. And so we see wisdoms appeal.

Jeremy Sweets  17:13
The Bible is an old book, but it's not an outdated book. It is just as applicable to us today. It's just as needed today. And wisdoms call can still be ignored today. So I would suggest that we need to listen to this appeal. We need to take it to heart. And the first thing that we need to do is take time to listen. That is the message of Proverbs, listen to instruction. In Proverbs 12, in verse 15, it says the way of a fool is right in his own eyes, but a wise man listens to advise. The fool listens to himself only the wise man listens to advice. And proverbs 10 Verse eight, the wise of heart will receive commandments, but a babbling fool will come to ruin. In James one and verse 19. There we see the instruction of wisdom in the New Testament, it says that we are to be quick to hear, slow to speak, and slow to anger. We need to be a people that listen. We listen to God primarily. Instead of being quick to speak, I think this this is what I want. This is what I desire, we stop. We are silent. We listen to God, we submit ourselves to Him, we receive His instruction that is so necessary, and so needed. When it comes to other people. We also need to be willing to listen now that doesn't mean that they will be always right like gods were. But we still need to be quick to hear and listen to other. Hear what they're saying that will give us a better way to relate and talk to them and maybe spread the truth or it may be that we may learn something there. But we need to be quick to hear quick to listen. This is a lost art today. I'm sure you know that. People want to be quick to talk, quick to share quick to spread, but they are very slow to listen. It's funny in art sound by age if you can't relay your message in approximately three seconds, then it's not worth my turn five to read something this long. I would never want to do that or longer. We need to be a people that listen and we're going to be swimming against the stream today. If we take the time to listen but It's what wisdom calls us to do. What wisdom calls us to do. Not only that, but wisdoms appeal today is to live securely now who doesn't want that? We buy security systems. We buy many different things to protect ourselves to give us some sense of of security but true security is found in heating, wisdoms advice. And proverbs three in verses 21 through 26. Proverbs 321 through 26. Notice the security of wisdom, you can dwell securely, first 21 My son, do not lose sight of these keep sound, wisdom and discretion, and they will be life for your soul and adornment for your neck, then you will walk on your way securely, and your foot will not stumble. If you lie down, you will not be afraid when you lie down your sleep will be sweet. Do not be afraid of sudden terror of the ruin of the wicked when it comes for the Lord will be your confidence and will keep your foot from being cons do not withhold good from those to whom it is due when it is in your power to do it. And it goes on with more instruction. But do you see the sweetness the security of wisdom here? The Bible God and His Word calls us to live a life of security live securely.

Jeremy Sweets  21:33
In Proverbs, there's many instructions. And this is only a very small sampling. But you'll see that wisdom builds strong homes and good family relationships. And there is a security and a living securely in that. And proverbs 24 And verse three by wisdom a house is built, and by understanding it is established. Wisdom also produces good workers those that are busy doing their work. And proverbs 14 And verse 35. It says a servant who deals wisely has the king's favor, live securely do your work. Wisdom also allows those that are facing troubles to overcome obstacles. Proverbs 21 And 22 says a wise man scales the city of the mighty and brings down the stronghold in which they trust the wise man can scale the city wisdom also diffuses difficult situations. And proverbs 29 And verse eight it says scoffer set a city of flame, but the y's turn away, right? And that's only a sampling the whole book of Proverbs and there's other wisdom literature in Scripture that point us to living in a wise way, live securely. And we need to heed the advice of Scripture. Not only that, but part of living securely is avoiding the folly of sin. If there is a danger ahead, we try to warn people about that danger. I was on the way here this morning and I had a son that flashed up left lane blocked ahead and there was a fender bender crash that was blocking some of the traffic and so it warned me watch out ahead. Scripture does the same thing. Watch out, there is sin ahead and it will lead to destruction. Avoid the folly of sin. In Proverbs one and verse seven. It says my son if sinners entice you do not consent. And in verse 15, it says do not walk in the way with them hold your foot from their paths. And proverbs two, verses 11 through 16. There we see the idea of refraining keeping away from sin and folly. Proverbs two in verse 11. Discretion will watch over you, understanding will guard you delivering from the way of evil for men of perverted speech, who forsake the past of a brightness to walk in the ways of darkness, who rejoice in doing evil and delight in the perverseness of evil men whose paths are crooked and who are devious in their ways. So you will be delivered from the Forbidden woman from the adulterous with her smooth words. And scripture talks about sin and many other places and proverbs and elsewhere. Sin is to be avoided. Sin is to be something that we stay away from. It's not something we flirt with or get close or say I'm gonna do a little bit of this. Now we're to flee from sin and stay away from it. And we do that because it is harmful to us. It is harmful to us. So like drugs that may give a small, brief high, but in actuality, you're taking, you know, illegal drugs and things like that is extremely harmful, extremely harmful. You're putting death in your body. And so it is with sin. You chase a quick, high, a quick, little joy, but you're putting death in your body. And so the Scripture says, avoid the folly of sin.

Jeremy Sweets  25:35
And it also says, Fear God and really this is the whole basis or the basis, the underlying foundation, the most important element of wisdom. This is what wisdom is built around. Fear God, we often quote proverbs one seven is really a key verse from the entire book. The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge, fools despise wisdom and instruction. But this idea of fearing God is not only found in Proverbs one in verse seven, if you do a quick search, you'll see many, many different results on the fear of the Lord, particularly in Proverbs. Notice some of these and Proverbs nine and verse 10. The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom. And the knowledge of the Holy One is insights. The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom. And the knowledge of the Holy One is insights in Proverbs 15 And verse 33. Proverbs 15 And verse 33. The fear of the Lord is the instruction for wisdom and before honor comes humility, before honor comes humility. In chapter 14 And verse 2614 26, in the fear of the Lord, there is strong confidence and his children will have refuge, strong confidence, refuge for his children, in job 28 In verse 28, there a chapter devoted to the strength and the goodness of wisdom. It says in the man, he said, speaking of what God has said, Behold, the fear of the Lord that is wisdom. And apart from evil is understanding, to depart from evil is understanding. Proverbs eight and verse 13, the fear of the Lord is to hate evil, pride and arrogance and the evil way and the perverted mouth, I hate.

Jeremy Sweets  27:43
Proverbs 14 And verse 27, the fear of the Lord is a fountain of life that one may avoid the snares of death, a fountain of life. And in Psalm 111 And verse 10, the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, good understanding, have all those who do His commandments, his praise endures forever. You know, as we think about wisdom, calling out to those that are simple, and asking them to repent, it's not far different than what the gospel message does. The proclamation of the gospel does much the same thing, calling out to those that are living in their sin, and telling them to repent and turn away from it. In fact, as I read through all those passages on fearing God, notice some of the things that it says, it says those that fear the Lord will have insight and knowledge of the Holy One is their inside knowledge of God. It says before honor comes humility, there needs to be a knowledge of God and a humility, a humbling of oneself, that's needed to receive instruction that's needed to receive and obey the gospel message. It says that those that live in the fear of the Lord will have strong confidence. we humble ourselves, but we play strong confidence in God. It says that they depart from evil and Joe 28. They turn away from pride and arrogance. And so it is you see that that wisdom commands that we would turn away from evil, and that's what the gospel demands, because God is good, and cannot live with evil in that way. We also see in Proverbs 14, verse 27, it says that wisdom or the fear of the Lord is a fountain of life. Life is what the gospel message offers. Life is the promise that is given through the gospel. In fact, it's a a one way promise, a one path kind of promise. Life is found in God and no other there's no other path. If you can get to life it's found in God through Jesus Christ. wisdoms. Call as a preacher as really a similar message to the gospel. Hear the gospel message, humble yourselves turn away from evil, repent of your sins, put your confidence in God confessing that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living God, obey Him. We see obedience is a response to God's grace and His mercy and what he has done for us. Obedience is something we do out of a thankful heart to God. And so we see that we are baptized and that is the start of that life long commitment of obedience. Maybe there's someone here this morning that is not a Christian here wisdoms. Call here the call of the gospel and obey the gospel. become a child of God and have your sins washed away so that you can have a hope of life with God and eternity. If you're here this morning and you are a Christian and you're not living as you should, then you need to make changes immediately. Do what you know to be right. There's any subject to the invitation, please come as we stand and sing at this time.
