It's good to see each of you here this morning if you have your Bibles and want to be turning to First Kings, chapter 18. First Kings chapter 18.

A little over a month ago, the United States was struck with one of the worst natural disasters in its history. Hurricane Harvey brought over 50 inches of rainfall to parts of Louisiana and Texas, the nation's fourth largest city, Houston was overwhelmed with widespread flooding. And when you see some of the numbers, it's pretty staggering 30,000 People had to be evacuated 10s of 1000s lost power. And some of the estimates that have come in about the damage, have said that the cost could reach upwards of 190 million. And if that's accurate, that would be more than Hurricane Sandy in 2012. And Hurricane Katrina in 2005. Combined, those two hurricanes in terms of the total cost of damage. In the midst of the chaotic and devastating situation, there were also some amazing accounts of the relief and the rescue efforts that were going on. The first responders, firefighters, police officers, they were working around the clock to try and help people get out of harm's way. There were also ordinary citizens who took action. There was a group from East Texas and part and Louisiana that called themselves the Cajun Navy. And these were just regular people who had fishing boats and trucks and they headed down into the areas that had been affected. And through coordinated efforts, they were actually able to rescue and help hundreds, if not 1000s of people who were stranded. One of these men when interviewed by the media and asked why are you doing this? He said we know what it feels like to face a major disaster. And we're doing it just because it's the right thing to do. We're helping people out. It truly was an example of ordinary people performing an extraordinary service. The Bible is full of individuals characters, real life, people who lived ordinary lives just like you and us just like you and I. And although their names may not be revered, and repeated again and again, throughout the scriptures, like David or Daniel or some of the other well known prophets, they still leave a legacy and a testament to the type of faith that God's people should have. So read with me from First Kings chapter 18. About an ordinary man who had extraordinary faith, a man by the name of Obadiah. First Kings chapter 18, beginning in verse one. It says, it came to pass after many days that the word of the Lord came to Elijah in the third year saying, Go present yourself to Ahab and I will send rain on the earth. So Elijah went to present himself to Ahab, and there was a severe famine in Samaria. And Ahab called Obadiah, who was in charge of his house. Now Obadiah feared the Lord greatly. For so it was while Jezebel massacred the prophets of the Lord that Obadiah had taken 100 prophets, and hidden them 50 to a cave, and fed them with bread and water. And they have said to Obadiah go into the land to all the springs of water and to all the Brooks. Perhaps we may find grass to keep the horses and mules alive, so that we will not have to kill any of the livestock. So they divided the land between them to explore it, Ahab went one way by himself, and Obadiah went another way by himself.

Conrad Harkrider  04:52
These first few verses describe a very difficult time for the nation of Israel. If there is a severe drought that has come upon the land, but not just by some type of natural cause or disaster, the Lord has brought this about in Chapter 17. And verse one, God sends Elijah the prophet to Ahab to tell him, that rain is not going to fall, until he gives the word. It's not just the environment that is devastating and difficult. But the overall spiritual state of the nation is in great decline. ruling over them is one of the worst, if not the worst kings that had ever been over God's people. Ahab is described as one who did more evil in the sight of the LORD than all the kings who were before him. And there were some pretty bad kings that preceded him. And so Elijah comes in chapter 18. And after about three years, the Lord tells him to go and stand before a hab and say that there is going to be rain that will come on the land. Now, can you imagine what this must have looked like? No rain, no water, no dew, or precipitation for three years, the land would have been dry and parched like a desert. And it says in verse two, that there was a severe famine in the land, they have no water, they have no food, and the situation is starting to look hopeless. But the whole time God is in control. He's using this event to try and bring the people's hearts back to him. Meanwhile, Ahab, who is the king decides that he is personally going to go and look for water in the land. Certainly, for surely he would have had servants, or soldiers or others who could have done this work for him. But you get the sense of a general who wants to visit the front lines during the battle. He wants to see the conditions on the ground, see it for himself. And so now Elijah, excuse me, Ahab comes, and he's going to go on this scouting mission. He brings with him a man named Obadiah. Verse three says that this man was over his house, a chief steward, the chief adviser, somebody who saw over the affairs, the daily events that happened within the house. And this was a position of prominence, he would have been looked to for guidance and advice and perspective. And he tells Obadiah, that they need to go throughout the land and look for some springs and brooks of water. Maybe there was some little place underground that hadn't dried up where you could still find some water. And so they set out on this mission, Elijah or Ahab heads in one direction. Obadiah heads in the other. Look at what it says in verse seven, First Kings 18 And verse seven. Now as Obadiah was on his way, suddenly Elijah met him and he recognized him and fell on his face and said, Is that you, my lord, Elijah? And he answered him, it is I go, tell your master Elijah, go tell your master Elijah is here. So he said, How have I sinned, that you are delivering your servant into the hands of Ahab to kill me, as the Lord your God lives, there is no nation or Kingdom where my master has not sent someone to hunt for you. And when they said, He is not here, he took an oath from the kingdom or nation that they could not find you. And now you say, Go tell your master Elijah is here. And it shall come to pass as soon as I am gone from you that the Spirit of the Lord will carry you carry you to a place I do not know. So when I go until Ahab, and he cannot find you, he will kill me. But I, your servant, have feared the Lord, from my youth.

Conrad Harkrider  09:21
In verses seven through 12, we see the return of Elijah Elijah has been on the run for a long time during this whole period of drought. And now he comes back and he presents himself as Obadiah is going on this mission to try and find water he sees someone off in the distance. He falls, he calls out and he says is that you Elijah? And when he realizes that it is he falls down on his face in a show of respect Obadiah reveals that There has been this massive manhunt that has been going on. Ahab has sent His Messengers into all of the surrounding areas, even into other countries to try and find the prophet Elijah. But Elijah was not hiding in some ivory tower somewhere he wasn't cooped up in a palace in a foreign land, God had sent him to the brook Cherith. And there he provided for him by the by the Ravens. And after the bird dried up, he sent him to the land of Sidon, to a widow in Zarephath. And there she provided for his needs. But Obadiah basically says, Look, this is a pretty serious operation that has been going on Ahab has been spending a lot of time and effort trying to find you. And I can't just walk up to him and say, you know, here's Elijah. Hey, boss, I wasn't able to find any water. But I did find the most wanted man in all of Israel, Elijah, and just how all that was going to play out Ahab's reaction and response to that, this man that he has been hunting for for such a long period of time. Obadiah is concerned that Elijah might get carried away by the Spirit of the Lord. Not sure if that was a common mode of transportation, if Elijah used the Spirit of the Lord to go from place to place, or if this was just a common belief or sentiment, a reason why they could never find this guy because the Spirit of the Lord just kept moving him from place to place and he was almost untouchable. But whatever the reason, Obadiah is concerned that if he follows through and goes and says this to the king, it's going to cost him his life. Look at verse 13. It says, was it not reported to my Lord, what I did when Jezebel killed the prophets of the Lord, how I hit 100 Men of the Lord's prophets 50 to a cave, and fed them with bread and water. This is Obadiah speaking here, he's saying, Do you remember what I did when Jezebel was trying to hunt these prophets down? Verse 14, and now you say, Go tell your master Elijah is here, he will kill me. Then Elijah says, the Lord of hosts lives before whom I stand, I will surely present myself to him today. So Obadiah went to meet Ahab and told him and Ahab went to meet Elijah. Then it happened when Ahab saw Elijah that Ahab said to him is that you owe traveller of Israel?

Conrad Harkrider  12:47
And he answered, I have not troubled Israel, but you and your father's house have in that you have forsaken the commandments of the Lord and follow the bills. Now, therefore sin and gather all Israel to me on Mount Carmel, the 450 prophets of Baal, and the 400 prophets of Astra who eat a Jezza bells table. Verse 13, Obadiah, gives this example of how he is on the Lord side, he's trying to fight for the cause by saving these prophets. And now, Elijah is going to put him in harm's way by sending him back to Ahab. But Elijah assures him that he is going to be present for the meeting. When Ahab comes and sees this prophet, there's no handshakes or hugs or cordial greetings. He just comes right out with it, and calls him the traveler of Israel. He's basically saying, This is your fault. We wouldn't be in this situation, I wouldn't have to be walking around in the land searching in the dirt and dust to try to find water. If it wasn't for you. Elijah doesn't back down. He turns the tables and says, No, it is you and your father's house. Because you have left the commands of the Lord and you've served these false gods. That's the reason why these things have happened. And then Elijah calls for a great gathering to be held on Mount Carmel, all the prophets of Baal and Asherah will come and present themselves before him. I believe in this chapter there is a distinct difference that is highlighted between the attitude and the character of this man Obadiah. A man that we only read about in First Kings chapter 18. This is a different Obadiah than the one who wrote the book. But if you compare him to the King Ahab His attitude and demeanor. There's a great difference and distinction. So notice a few of those characteristics. First of all, look at verse three, there is a parenthetical statement that is made in verse three, it says, Now Obadiah feared the Lord greatly. Also in verse 12, at the end of the verse, it says, But I, your servant have feared the Lord, from my youth. We see that Obadiah was a man who feared the Lord greatly. That is, he had this honor and disrespect and reverence that he showed for the Lord. And not just a few times in his life. But what he points out is that this is something that has been a part of him, from the time that he was a young man, he has had this respect for God. This is amazing considering the fact that he is living in the northern part of Israel, a place where idolatry and sin and backsliding against God those things are commonplace. And not only is he living in a very difficult environment, but he is serving in the house, in the court of this wicked king Ahab. And yet we find him holding fast to his convictions, and faith. Now compare that with Ahab. In verse four, we see that instead of fearing the Lord Ahab was seeking to destroy his prophets. In verse four, it says it was while Jezza Bill massacred the prophets of the Lord, they go on this campaign, they say, if these prophets are going to say things that are harmful, that are negative, that are detrimental to us, then we're just going to wipe them out. We're just going to clear them out of the land. And so, Ahab with Jesu, bells, help, go and start to systematically remove all of the prophets of the Lord.

Conrad Harkrider  17:15
They don't want to hear anything else. It kind of reminds you of what was said in First Kings chapter 22 And verse eight. This is a hab speaking. Ahab, the king of Israel said to Jehoshaphat there is yet one man by whom we may inquire of the Lord mkhaya, the son of Imola, but I hate him, for he never prophesies good concerning me, but evil, I don't, I can't stay in this guy. Because every time he comes and delivers us a message, it's always something bad, it's always something negative. And he wanted to hear good things, positive things, how he was going to prosper, things that would confirm the direction that he was heading. There's a great difference between these two men. One who respected and honored the Lord. One who when he saw that there was some type of need, and he could help. He was open and willing to serve where he could and then the other is doing everything that he can to go against and work against the Lord's plans. We think about where do we stand? Are we the type of people that show that reverence, and fear for God? Or do we find our find ourselves working against his plans and purposes, fearing the Lord means that we are people who honor and respect his word, if you ever seen a little child who is standing off to the side, while all the rest of the kids are playing, and you think to yourself, why are they by themselves? Why don't they go join everyone else? And so maybe you go up and you ask them, you know, don't you want to go and play with everyone? And they say, My dad told me to stay here until he comes back. That's respecting that's honoring that's fearing the word of their father. That's putting someone else's desire and intention above their own what they might want to do. And that's what we see in the life of Obadiah. The fear and respect for the Lord, do we have the type of attitude that says, Lord, whatever you ask me to do? Wherever you send me to go, no matter how difficult or challenging it may be, I'm going to follow you. Fearing the Lord means that We respect his ways we honor His commandments. And these are not things that are a burden or that weigh us down or put us down, but rather fearing God is to our benefit. In Psalm 111 And verse 10, it says, The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, all those who practice it, have a good understanding, his praise endures forever. This fear, this respect for God is ultimately leads us to wisdom. It is to our benefit so so it is with children who LISTEN and OBEY and respect their parents. It's not just to put them down or to be hard on them, but that is for their own good. Obadiah was a man who had great fear for the Lord. Also, notice what it says in verse seven. In verse seven, it says, Now, as Obadiah was on his way, suddenly Elijah met him. And he recognized him, and fell on his face and said, Is that you, my lord, Elijah, when Obadiah realizes that the prophet of the Lord is coming to him, he falls down on his face in respect. Look what he says in verse nine. He says, Obadiah says, How have I sinned? That you are delivering your servant into the hand of Ahab, to kill me?

Conrad Harkrider  21:32
Obadiah when approached by the prophet, he asked this question, How have I sinned? What have I done wrong? And I believe what we see here is an attitude of someone who was looking inwardly Obadiah puts the focus on himself. Here is this prophet who comes and tells him to do something that feels like a death sentence, like a punishment from God. And so his question is not to say this is unfair, or why are you letting this happen to me, but he says, What have I done? How have I contributed to this happening? He is essentially taking responsibility for his actions, whatever that may have been. It turns out that this assumption is wrong. Elijah is not trying to get rid of Obadiah by sending him to Ahab. But the point is the same Obadiah has this attitude of reflection and humility. Where have I overstepped? Where do I need to change? Compare that with Ahab in verse 17. When Elijah comes to Ahab, in verse 17, he says, You traveller of Israel. And what we see in a hab is a man who shifts the blame onto other people. He is looking for an excuse, or looking for some type of scapegoat who he can put this responsibility on. It is your fault that we are in this situation. Do you see how easily how easily we can fall into that type of thinking? Where we start to look at everyone else, we start to see the things that are happening in our lives, and the blame and the responsibility rests on those around us. Do you remember what happened in the Garden of Eden? God told Adam and Eve not to eat from the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil. And after all that happened and went down, the Lord approaches them and he asked them what had gone on in Genesis chapter three and verse 12. In response to the Lord, Adam, the man said, The woman whom you gave me to be with, she gave me fruit of the tree and I ate, see what he's doing there. He's pointing the finger. She is the one who brought the fruit and that's why I ate it. And it seems as if he sees, it seems as if he's also indicting God, and this, you God are the one who gave her to me. Eve says the same does the same type of thing. When she's asked by the Lord, she points the finger and says, It was the serpent who deceived me. It is our natural tendency to often shift responsibility for our actions to someone else to justify ourselves. And I know for me, when somebody provides criticism or criticism or feedback, or says something about the way I do things, it's often hard to hear that it's hard to listen to, maybe aren't initial response is just just to try to come up with some type of rebuttal or to fight back against it. But proverbs 19 In verse 20 says, listen to advice and accept instruction, that you may gain wisdom in the future. Someone told us early on when we first became parents, that you should always listen to advice. Now, that doesn't mean that you're going to incorporate everything every person tells you. Otherwise, you know, your kids may be wearing crazy clothes or eating weird foods or whatever it may be. But to listen, you can't grow. If you don't change. You can't change if you don't learn. And you can't learn if you don't, listen. It's a process. We can't mature as people if we're not willing to accept and receive the perspective and the wisdom that often comes from other people. Maybe God has put this person in your way, maybe you don't agree with everything that they do or stand for even the type of person they are. But their words, maybe God has given that to you, to help shape you to give you a different perspective.

Conrad Harkrider  26:28
But instead of trying to push the blame onto others, looking inwardly at ourselves, trying to better ourselves. This is something that comes up in relationships quite a bit. Consider a hypothetical illustration. You're driving in the car. And one person says, you know, I hate when we're running late. And the other person says, well, we wouldn't be running late, if it didn't take you forever to get ready. And she said, and then the other person says, No, we wouldn't be running late. If you wouldn't have missed the exit. No, we would have missed the exit, if you would have told me where the turn is? No, I would have told you where the turn was, if the radio wasn't up so loud, and on and on, it goes back and forth. Who fault is it that we're in this situation? Something that's important for us to realize early on, is that the only person that we can change is ourselves. As hard as we try to redirect someone and get them to do things differently. We only have control over our own actions. And that's what Jesus said in Matthew chapter seven, in verse five, we have to remove the log from our own eyes before trying to take the speck out of another's looking inwardly first, before trying to correct the issue or, or behavior of someone else. And finally, notice what Obadiah does in verse 13. It says, Now it was wasn't not reported to my Lord, what I did when Jezebel killed the prophets of the Lord, how I hit 100 Men of the Lord's prophets 50, to a cave and fed them with bread, and water. We see that oh is Obadiah in this great in a situation of great risk and difficulty, he sacrifices himself for others, he takes these men and he finds a place where it will be safe for them. He puts them in a cave, and it's not just a one time thing, he drops him off and then leaves. He goes back again and again, taking provisions food and water. Maybe this was days, weeks, or possibly even months, that he's caring for the servants of God. When you compare that to Ahab, in verse five, we see a man who is concerned about himself. Did you notice why Ahab wants to go throughout the land searching for water, verse five says, Let us go into the land to all the springs of water to all the Brooks perhaps we may find grass to keep the horses and mules alive. There's a famine in the land. There are people, their children, their families that are starving, that don't have enough to eat. Perhaps people are leaving the land as Naomi and her husband did in the book of Ruth. And Ahab is concerned about the donkeys. He's worried about the horses. He's thinking about his concerns and his interests. And it appears that he has no awareness, or at least he's not thinking about how this is affecting the rest of the nation. And so as we think about the type of character that we are to have, we see this ordinary man who's in a very difficult situation, and yet he reaches out and he helps others. Sometimes when we think about sacrifice, we think in terms of these heroic acts where somebody rushes into a burning building, or they dive in front of someone and take a bullet in the chest. And certainly those would be amazing acts of sacrifice, Jesus said, that there is no greater love, that one can have than one would lay down his life for another person. But sacrifice does not have to be an all out giving of your life. It's something that can happen every day. It starts with our attitude, our state of mind. How do we view the people around us.

Conrad Harkrider  31:11
And when I, when one of us gives up our seat for another person, that's a show of sacrifice. When we take the time to talk to someone who is older or younger than us and show interest in the lives of others, when we go and visit, a person who's shut in are sick, or who may not be able to get out very much, or who maybe just doesn't have very many visitors come. That's a show of sacrifice. When we have people into our homes, buying the food, preparing the food, making sure everyone has what they need. And then there's always the cleanup. That's a show of sacrifice. Obadiah knew what it meant to give to others. And he was exhibiting the AVID attitude that Paul mentions in Philippians chapter two and verse three, when he says that he counted others more significant than himself. I think this is such a powerful story, because this is an ordinary man. Yes, he had a high ranking job, but he was just trying to serve God the best that he could, in the situation that he found himself in. And the same is true for each one of us today. We don't have to write a book of the Bible, we Obadiah wasn't a prophet, we're not told. We don't have to hold some special position with him within the church or the kingdom. But just diligently serving God, fearing him respecting him, being the type of people who look inward first, and then being willing to sacrifice for others. We close this morning with a song to encourage everyone who is here, there's something that we can do to help you in your walk with Christ. Whether you have a desire to put on Christ through baptism, to confess your faith in Him and to begin that walk, or if we can just help you on your way. If you have a need, please come down to the front as we stand and sing
