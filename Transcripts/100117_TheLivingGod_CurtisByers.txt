Good to see everyone and I appreciate so much for being here with us. And it's good to see those of you who had been to the mountain this weekend. glad that you all have made a safe journey back least I think it looks like most of our back. We've been blessed with a beautiful weekend and I'm thankful for the opportunity to talk about God's word. It's always a pleasure and a privilege to open the Scriptures and to study it. I hope the things prepared tonight will be useful. It has occurred to me I was reading Jeremy's history of Broadmoor not too long ago, it came up in my view, and my reckoning is correct. This month, the congregation's it's been 55 years since it was formed. Ewing Lane just across the road. And there are several members here who were there. Then Andrews, Sister savely. And Sister pause was I think came shortly thereafter. Sister Downing, Sister Davis, all original members of their church here. We don't you know, we don't keep track of annual birthdays and celebrations like that in the church. Really. I don't bring it up for any sort of purpose like that. But I do think you know, as two things one, I wonder if the brother brothers and sisters who started the church 25 years ago, could in their wildest imaginations believe that the Church will still be here. And Leeson all appearances doing well. I don't know. It's hard to look that far in the future, isn't it? But it's, but it has been the case. But then secondly, I wonder how Lord looks at us. Now he measures our progress over time over time and over our efforts year after year to worship Him in a local congregation of his people. And his measuring rod is the correct measuring rod and and I guess with regard to that was if we say we just need to keep on doing our best we can and keep on trying to live each day. And who knows maybe another 55 years of congregation will still be here. Another group of people worship and serving God. Pick up the night our study where Conrad left off. He spoke to us this morning for the first part of First Kings chapter 18. He might open your Bibles to that passage. He spoke to us about Obadiah in the first 19 verses of the chapter. And I want us to begin our study by looking at the event. They're in the latter part of First Kings 18 with Elijah and the prophets of bale. This is a fairly lengthy reading. In fact, I'm gonna be doing a little a lot of reading tonight. But on this particular passage is rather long. But I want to read the entire passage because I think it's powerful. And the scriptures is more powerful than what I can say. So I asked for strength to read it well. First 21st kings 18. So I have sent to all the people of Israel and gathered the prophets together at Mount Carmel. And alive Elijah came near to all the people and said, How long will you go limping between two different opinions? If the Lord has God, follow him, but if Baal, then follow him. And the people did not ask for him a word. Then Elijah said to the people, I even I only am a prophet, or am left a prophet of the Lord. But Bayless, prophets are 450 men, let two bulls bulls be given to us, and let them choose one bull for themselves and cut it in pieces and lay it on the wood, but put no fire to it. And I will prepare the other Buble and lay it on the wood and put no fire to it. And you call upon the name of your God, and I will call upon the name of the Lord, and the God who answers by fire, he is God. And all the people answered in his Well spoken. That Elijah said to the prophets of Bale, choose for yourself one bull and prepare first for you are many, and call upon the name of your God but put no fire to it. And they took the bull that was given them and they prepared it and call upon the name of bale from morning until noon saying O Baal, answer us. But there was no voice and no one answered. And they limped around the altar that they had made. And I knew and Elijah mocked them saying cry allow for he's a guide. Either he is amusing, or he is relieving himself, or is he on a journey or perhaps he has asleep and must be awakened and they've cried aloud and cut themselves out to their customers swords and lances until the blood gush out upon them.

Curtis Byers  05:02
And as they pass, they raved on until the time of the offering of the of the ablation. But there was no voice. No one answered, no one paid attention. Then Elijah said to all the people come near to me, and all the people came near to him, and he repaired the altar of the Lord that had been thrown down. Elijah took 12 stones, according to the number of the tribes, the sons of Jacob, to him, the word of the Lord came saying, Israel shall be your name. And with the stones, he built the altar and the name of the Lord. And he made a trench about the altar, as great as would contain two CEOs of seed. And he put the wood in order and cut the bowl and pieces, and laid it on the wood. And he said, feel for jars with water and pour it on the burnt offering. And on the wound, he said, do it a second time. And they did it a second time. And he said, do it a third time, and they did it a third time. And the water ran around the altar and filled a trench also with water. At a time of the offering, though by ablation, Elijah, the prophet came near and said, Oh, Lord, God of Abraham, Isaac and Israel, let it be known this day that you are God in Israel, and that I am your servant, and that I have done all these things at your word. Answer me, oh, Lord, answer me. This people may know that you, oh Lord our God, and that you have turned, and that they have turned to you have turned their back their hearts back, excuse me. And the fire of the Lord fail and consume the burnt offering and the wood and the stones and the dust, and licked up the water that was in the trench. And when all the people saw it, they fell in their faces and said, The Lord, He is God, the Lord, He is gone. Know the auto worshipers. At all 450 of those prophets couldn't see the obvious. They truly believed that their God had power. They truly expect it. The bill would have brought fire down from heaven to consume their altar. You know, the the faith of these idol worshipers was a scream because scrambling strong. Never had they ever seen their god perform an act of power. And yet they believed that their God could perform great power. That's in direct contrast Oh, in this passage, because the God of Israel, the God we worship, was able to sin fire from heaven and consumable altar, an altar even though it had been drenched in water multiple times. The God of heaven and earth is a God that does things. There's two other occasions until their passage in the Old Testament come to my mind. narratives like this that I want to just briefly bring up to us wasn't judges the sixth chapter. So you might turn to Judges chapter six. There that passage we read about Gideon dabba Guinea, Gideon, his own estimation, he was just a simple man and a small family in a rather insignificant tribe. But God told Gideon that he would be the ones to save Israel from Midian. The Minion eyes were oppressing Israel. And the pressure was so severe that the scriptures say that Israel was brought very low because of median. But Gideon didn't know if he's up for the task of God gives him a small task to do first. He tells Gideon to go into knock over the bell statute of his father. And next to the bail stature there was the Astra he told him to cut down that Ashra and then he was built an altar and a sacrifice his father's bull on that altar. Gideon did it exactly as the Lord had prescribed, he was a little bit hesitant because the scripture says that he did it at night, because he was afraid of his family. He was afraid of the people within the city Apparently, these altars that within his dad's these the statues within his dad's house, were apparently idols that were used by the entire community.

Curtis Byers  09:54
But anyway, the next morning when people came and saw the doctor had been knocked over a bail was one on the ground and Asheville had been cut, they were quite upset and they start looking around and seeking and investigating and they determined that the act was done by Gideon. So they approached Gideon his father Joash and said, Joash Your son has done this bring him out so that we may, you know, punish him for what he has done. Now, I don't know much about Joash. Apparently he allowed these altered these statues to be in his his house, he apparently worshipped film in some sense or another. When it verses 31 and 32. He does speak with uncommonly good since, apparently, and something that the people of the city didn't understand. And Joe, I said to all those who stood against him, will you contend for bail? Or will you save him? Whoever contends for him shall be put to death by mourning. If he is a God, let him contend for himself because his altar has been broken down. You get the Jesus way, saying, you know why? Why do you feel like you need to protect bail? Why do you need to revenge bale of bales of God let him Let him do his own finches. Let him punish Gideon if he is a God, you don't need to do it on his behalf. The people that city didn't understand that Joash apparently did it over Second Chronicles 24. Another passage, who would read about Amaziah who was a king of Judah. Second Chronicles, I said 24 But I think second Pentacles 25 Excuse me. Second Chronicles 25. Was I was the king of Judah he was the son of Joash. This is a different Joash. But Joash as a young man was faithful to the Lord, he was faithful as long as Jehovah was the priest. But once Jehovah died Joash your toes began to turn away from the Lord and seek other gods. His son Amaziah also started out to be good and Lord. Scripture says that he he did that wishes right in the eyes of the Lord. But he too, as he got older, he too turned away from the Lord. And at this particular point in time, we can see that he has his heart is not with the Lord. So in verse 14 of Second Chronicles 25. Verses 1415, this text says, After Amaziah came from striking down the Edomites Edom is where the arch enemies, he brought the gods or the men of seer and set them up as his gods and worship them making offerings to them. You know what's wrong with that picture? Amaziah defeats the Edomites. But he then he takes the gods of the demise, and brings them back as a system up and bows down to worship those gods. Well, therefore the Lord was angry with Amazon and sent him a prophet who said to him, why have you sought the gods of a people who did not deliver their own people from your hand? You know, what did amaza not see? Those guys were not able to protect the enemies from him. So why should he offer them any armies? Why he should he offer them any worship, they clearly were ineffective. Gods. You know, this, this, this picture of idol worshipers is replete throughout the entire Old Testament, New Testament as well. They are constantly going to worship idols, but the idols are not able to respond and then protect or to provide any blessings. Now, what I want to do first tonight, I want to or at this point is to just look at a bunch of passages. I'm gonna read these quickly, so you'll not have time probably to turn in the Bible to follow along. Someone will be rather short passages, some will be longer. I want you to just listen to the words of the prophets than David and some others. How they describe and that sarcasm within their voice, as they describe those who have, you know, worship an idol. We don't have idol worshippers, round us typically. So this whole notion of worshipping idols seems pretty foreign to us. But it was the it was the common way people of the ancient world worship throughout the entire Old Testament period and into the New Testament period.

Curtis Byers  14:50
And just listen to the way that the Lord describes the foolishness of this. I'm gonna go read these fairly quickly. Now as I had a 44 of chapter or verse 12. The text says the Irish man takes a cutting tool and works it over the coals he fashioned say with the hammers and works it. With his strong arm he becomes hungry in his string fails, he drinks no water in his fate. The carpenter stretches a line he marks it out with a pencil. He saves it with planes and marks with a compass. He saves it into the figure of a man with the beauty of a man to dwell in a house. He cuts down cedars or he chooses a cypress or a tree or oak, and lets it grow strong among the trees in the forest. He plants a cedar scheme plus a cedar, and the rain nourishes it, then it becomes fuel for a man he takes part of it, it warms himself, he candles a fire and bakes bread. Also he makes a God and worship is he makes it an idol or falls down before it. Half of it, he burns in the fire. Over the the other half he eats meat, he roasted in a satisfied he also warms up a high and war I have seen the fire and the rest of it he makes into a God his idol and falls down and worship Him who worships it. He prays to and says, deliver me, for you are my God. And Isaiah 46, verses five through seven, the Lord speaking is on this occasion. He says to whom are you liking me and make me equal or compare me that we may be alike. Those who lavish gold from the purse and whale silver in the scarce scales hired Goldsmith and he makes it into a God and they fall down and worship. They lift it to their shoulders, they carry it. They set it in his place. It stands there. It cannot move from his place. If one cries to it, he does not answer or save him from his trouble. In Jeremiah two verse 26. As a thief is shameful and caught, so the house of Israel shall be shamed when they their kings, their officials are praising their prophets who say to a tree, you are my father, and to a stone, you gave me birth, and they have turned their back to me and not their face. When the time of their trouble they say arise and save us. But where are your gods that you may for yourself? Let them arise if they can save you in your time of trouble. For as many as your cities are your gods. Oh, Judah. Jeremiah 10, verse eight. They are both stupid and foolish. The instruction of idols is Buck would beat and silver is brought from tarnish in gold from your friends you've had Excuse me. They are the work of the craftsmen in the hands of the goldsmith, their clothing as violet and purple. They are all the work of skilled men. And then verses 14 and 15. Every man is stupid and without knowledge. Every Goldsmith is put to shame by his idols for His images are false, and there is no breath in them. They are worthless, a work of delusion at the time of their punishment, they shall perish. And a Baca the second chapter, verse 18. What prophet is an idol? When his maker has shaped it and metal image a teacher of lies for his maker, trust in his own creation being when he makes speechless idols. Woe to him who says to a wooden thing, awake to a silent stone, arise? Can this teach? Behold is overlaid with gold and silver, and there is no breath at all in it. Psalm 115 Verse eight verses

Curtis Byers  19:12
not to us, oh Lord, not to us, but to your name give glory for the sake of your steadfast love and your faithfulness. Why should the nation say where is their God? Our God is in the heavens. He does all that he pleases. Their gods are silver and gold, the work of human hands, they have mouths, but do not speak. Eyes that do not see. They have ears but do not hear. Noses but do not smell. They have hands but do not feel feet, but do not walk and they do not make a sound in their throat. Those who make them become like them, so do all who trust in them. And then one passage from the New Town Remember Paul is speaking first Corinthians 12 Chapter, verse two simply says, you know that when you were pagans, you were led astray to mute idols. However you were led. How would you summarize these passages with a verdict of Scripture concerning idols is that they're blind, that they're deaf, they are mute, and they are weak. They're useless. Now, one more thing can be added to this list. I was reading an article just this week was published in the journal antiquity, there was some archaeologists who were doing some excavations around an ancient temple in Egypt. And they uncover some burial grounds in the immediate vicinity next to the temple. But the burial grounds were not the burial grounds of humans, they were the burial grounds of their idols. Apparently, their idols wore out, they deteriorated, they got old, they were they became, you know, dilapidated. And they had to be put the rest they have to be buried and new idols New Gods formed. So maybe we could also add to this list that idols die, right. But the God of Israel, the God that we serve, is, is different, you will not find our God in a cemetery. The Scripture is used as a phrase over and over again to describe our God. And as used in contrast to the descriptions of the idols that we have just read. And I, again, would like to read several passages until you again, I'll read these fairly quickly. But listen to the language again, how it describes our God and contrast what is said about our God, the God of Heaven, to the gods of this world. First and Deuteronomy, the fifth chapter, in verse 26. For who is there of all flesh, that has heard the voice of the living, God's speaking out of the midst of a fire as we have, and has still live? Go near and hear all that the Lord our God will say, and speak to us all that the Lord our God will speak to you? And we will hear and do it? In Joshua, the third chapter, verse 10, and Josh was said, here's how you will hear here's how you shall know that the living God is among you. And then he with will without fail drive out from before you the Canaanites, the Hittites, HIV is the parasites, the Giga Durga sighs, they have a rights and the Jebusites. in First Samuel the 17th chapter, verse 26. And David said to the men who stood by him, what shall be done for the man who kills his Philistine who takes away the reproach of Israel? For who is this uncircumcised listing, that he should defy the armies of the living God? In verse 36, your servant has struck down both lions and bears and his uncircumcised listing shall be like one of them, for he has defied the armies of a living God. Jeremiah 10 Chapter, the 10th. First is immediately after what we just read a few moments ago about the idols. Jeremiah says, But the Lord is a true God. He is the Living God, and the everlasting king, and his wrath, the earthquakes, and the nations cannot endure his Ignatian Daniel, the sixth chapter, in verse 20.

Curtis Byers  23:58
As he came near to the DN were Daniel was he crowd out in a tone of anguish, the king declare to Daniel, oh, Daniel, servant of the living God has your god whom you serve continually been able to deliver you from the lions. And then Daniel said to the king, Oh, King live forever. My God sent his angel shut the lions mouth and they have not harmed me because I was found blameless before him. And also before you Oh King, I have done no harm. Then the king was exceedingly glad he commanded the day will be taken up out of the den. So Daniel was taken up out of the den and no kind of harm was found on him because he trusted in his God and the king commanded. And those men who had maliciously accused Daniel were brought in cast into the den of lions they and their children and their wives, and before they reached the bottom of the DNA, the lions and were powered them and broke all their bones in pieces. Then King Darius wrote to all peoples, nations and languages that dwell at all All the earth, peace be multiplied to you I make a decree, that at all my royal Dominion people are to tremble and fear before the God of Daniel, for He is the Living God, and during forever, his kingdom shall never be destroyed his dominion shall be to the end. And acts the 14th chapter. Man, why are you doing these things? We also are men of like nature with you. And we bring you good news that you should turn from these things in vain things to a living God, who made the heaven and the earth and the sea. And all that is in them. The Second Corinthians, the sixth chapter, verse 16, what agreement has the temple of God with idols? For we are the temple of the living God, as God's said, I will make my dwelling among them and walk among them, and I will be their God and they shall be my people. Therefore, go out from their midst, and be separate from them, says the Lord and touch no unclean thing, that I will welcome you. And I will be a father to you and you shall be sons and daughters to me, says the Lord Almighty. First Timothy three, verse 15, if I delay, you may know how you ought to behave in the household of God wishes the church of the living God, a pillar and ground of the truth. And the fourth chapter of verse 10. For to this end, we toil and strive because we have our hope, set on the living God, who is the Savior of all people, especially of those who believe. Hebrews to tip chapter, verse 31, it is a fearful thing, to fall into the hands of the living God. For A Living God is a is all the things that an idol isn't. He's a God who sees he's a God who speaks. He's a God who hears and he's a God who can act. Now that is the God that we serve. Just wanna make a couple of observations to share with you and the lesson will be yours. I mentioned that the faith of idol worshipers must be awfully strong for them to believe that their God can do anything on their behalf. And then we're in the realm of evidences, there's two different opposing views of how one should view that area of apologetics. There is the one view that says that faith is is something that we can exercise, but there we have no way to prove our faith. That our faith is really just kind of some kind of leap into the into the night where we choose to believe. And we should be comfortable in that choice of faith. The other view that opposes that says that no faith is something we choose to do. But it's on the basis of evidences that we see.

Curtis Byers  28:15
I never could go along with that first view, never made a lot of sense to me. Because what I see in the scriptures, is God constantly reminding people even as today we're talking about the covenant with Israel, God reminded his people Israel, how, how he was the one who brought them up out of Egypt, within him with a mighty arm, on the wings of a Eagle. And they saw that they experienced that. And based on what they had seen, they should exercise faith and trust in God. What was the point of all the miracles in Scripture? Why are we told over and over again, all the things that God has done for his people, and we have records of all those things. Those are evidences that tell us something about God. And so when we believe and put our trust in God, we're just not randomly making that choice, because it makes us feel better, but rather, is because of the evidences that we see the truthfulness of what we read, that we believe that there is a God. And on the basis of that we have faith. Suddenly, back in the 1960s. There was a big do about the pronouncement of some other intellectuals who said that, you know, God is dead. Now, these weren't atheists that were saying they were they may have been atheists who were saying this, but that wasn't their point. They weren't trying to make the point that everybody had become atheists because that clearly was not the case then nor now. But the point that they were trying to make was that as they looked around the religious world, people who said that they believed in God Odd, as they looked at believers, they concluded that God is dead. And how would they conclude that? They concluded that because they said, you know, you look at these believers, they're acting as if God is dead. They don't take God seriously. He's an he's an inconvenience to him. He, their their religion as a matter of show and not of heart. So for all practical purposes, they're atheists themselves, they believe that God is dead, they just continue to give lip service to the fact that God is alive. Now is a pretty powerful indictment. And probably there was a lot of truth in that indictment, as as they looked at the religious world, as a whole. And I'm convinced that I've known people like that, while they're in the church, outside the church, people who say they are religious, but you really don't see much difference in their lives. Because of it. They still party, they still do things that the world does, in much the same way that the world does it. They don't take God's word very seriously. They just you know, they'll read it and put it back on the table when they get through reading and go on with their lives, until they want to pick it up again, for whatever reason and dust it off, dust off their god for a few minutes and continue on. You know, I don't I hope and trust. That doesn't describe me. hope and trust that doesn't describe you. But isn't it? Isn't it a possibility that we need to contemplate and consider? How could the god how could the Israelites after seeing God's hand at work and bringing them out of the land of Egypt with such great power? How could they, within a matter of weeks, began to make idols and worship idols just as they had they had done as they had done before he did that great act? How's that possible? Well, I don't know. But if it was possible for them to fall so quickly, surely it is possible for us to fall as well. You know, worshipping a dead god is kind of convenient. He doesn't get in the way. He's not very demanding. He doesn't insist that we live one way or the other. And if we do something that we ought not to do, there's there's no consequence, because the dead God can't do much about it. But if we, but if we are, but if we proclaim and believe that we worship a living God, a living God can do something about it. The Hebrew writer said is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of loving God. But even greater still, a living God can fulfill his promises.

Curtis Byers  33:09
A living God who says that there is a home in heaven, awaiting those who remain faithful to him. A LIVING GOD can fulfill that promise. And it's because of that, that we have hope. A dead god gives no hope. But a living God does. These passages that I've read are been favorites of mine for a long time. It's just passages I like to read over and over and over again, because they're powerfully tell us why we are here and what we should be doing.
