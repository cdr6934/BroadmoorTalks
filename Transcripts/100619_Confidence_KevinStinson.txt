Good to see you all this morning. Thank you for your attendance. Today I want to tell you about a story as we start our sermon this morning. On December 17 2008, there was a man named Scott Bowles and he was 46 years old. And he woke up in a hospital with no memory of who he was or how he got there. No memory at all. He didn't know the woman that was at his side, he didn't know that she was his wife of 24 years. He couldn't remember the births of his two young adult children. Or the fact that he had lost a daughter. He could not remember his time as a professional athlete, he was a played in the National Football League. After that he was in the aviation field. For a number of years, he couldn't remember anything about that at all. Scott had fallen that morning. And he had had a brain injury that caused his memory loss, he ended up able to form new memories and was able to, to live out his life. But could you imagine waking up one morning, and not having any memory of your life up to that point? You know, I woke up one morning I was on a business trip. I don't really travel very often. But it was a number of years ago, and I was in a hotel room. And it must have been like an interior room is like completely pitch black. And I woke up and I'm sure it was a very short period of time, you know how your brain can? It feels like a long time. But there was like a period a moment there that I wasn't exactly sure like the orientation of the room. You ever had that? I was like, like, where exactly am I? What is this room? I was kind of thinking like, what city am I in? And, and it was, I'm sure like just a split second. But it was an odd feeling. You may have had something similar in your life, maybe you've dealt with some form of memory loss or amnesia, or you've known somebody that has dealt with that. It's a scary thing to think about. But it kind of helps me think about the questions I want to talk about this morning about who we are. Do we know who we are? And also a second question, do we know where we're going? Or earlier this summer, we went on a vacation. So my family, we took a vacation to Florida and we went down to Universal Studio. And one thing to keep in mind is when you get to the gate, you should have your tickets with you. That's something that's good to know a little tip for that. But we went down there. And then after that we had a good day there. You know, one of those from dawn to dusk type days, just busy, busy. Then we went over and we stayed at a house that we'd rented for a few days on the beach. And there's some common things about these rentals. If you've ever stayed in a cabin, in the mountains or somewhere that you've rented something, there's a few common things you can start thinking about those. In your mind, what are the common things about these rentals, one, there's always a bookshelf, right with lots of books that you can read. And, you know, you get in there and look at these, these books and just want to read them all and that type of thing. So there's always books, there's almost always some games that are there. And what's one other thing that you may be thinking of is always there, every house I've been to, there's a jigsaw puzzle, there's always a jigsaw puzzle. And we got that jigsaw puzzle out, and we get it set out on the table and we start going to work. We start you know, day one kind of putting the board together. But you know, it's like we get there and it's kind of getting late so we can couldn't get too far. And then they till you're looking at it starting to come together, right and then just you know, different family members working on it starting to come together, then maybe you're there another day or so. And you start realizing that there's a problem. There are never all the pieces to these puzzles when you go to a real so that's one key if the box is open, don't start putting out and expecting all the puzzle pieces to be there. And sure enough, that was the case with our puzzle that we had this summer and you know, we started out being excited about it. And then it kind of leads to some frustration. And then you're disillusioned about the puzzle. And then you just kind of turn apathetic about the whole thing. Well, this is something similar to what Satan does. I think with us in this life, he tells us that we are supposed to have love that we're supposed to have happiness and fulfillment. And yet he doesn't give us what we need for that. He doesn't give anyone enough to accomplish this. He doesn't give out all the pieces he doesn't have them.

confusion comes from Satan. In First John five If you'll turn over to First John, that's where we'll spend most of our time this morning. In first, John, and we know this Satan is the father of lies, he's a deceiver. confusion comes from Satan. And first John five and verse 19. Here we see the advantage that we as Christians have over those in the world. It says, We know that we are from God, and the whole world lies in the power of the evil one. We know. You know, this morning, we're talking about confidence, who we are, where we're going. Here we see this statement that we know, we should have clarity and confidence. We should not be people that are confused. In first Corinthians 14 And verse 33. It says, For God is not the author of confusion. But if peace, that's who we follow the God of peace, the God that is the author, not the author of confusion, like Satan, Will, today's society is confused about a lot of things, right? Confused about roles in the home, confused about what success is and wrapping that up in money and in fame. And in looking at that as being successful confused about gender confused about marriage, lots of confusion, it things about that we would have never thought we would be confused about in our society today. The list goes on and on. And I don't want to belittle these things. These are important for us to think about and to talk about with others, there is real confusion with those around us in the world. This is what Satan is looking to do. He's looking to create confusion. But God wants us to have confidence and to know to be clear. God wants us to be clear about who we are and what we believe. Well, what about confidence? Think about a couple questions. Do you know who the mayor of Nashville is? So do you confidently know the answer to that question? Would you be willing to bet your life on it or those around you? You may be thinking okay, the mayor of Nashville, for some reason Briley Parkway comes into my mind. Is there something to do with that? And that was a former Mayor David Brawley. He's not the current mayor. I don't know if there's a swearing thing. But John Cooper is the the new mayor of Nashville had to look that up. I didn't know that. But there's certain questions that we have to know that we have to have confidence. What about the you know, the capital of Tennessee? Okay, I think everybody's much more confident with the capital of Tennessee, you know what that is? Your confidence level just went way up. You understand what the who what the capital of Tennessee is? Well, there are certain things in life, that we have to know, there's a difference between thinking and knowing between uncertainty and confidence. It may be okay for some things to not really know that aren't just aren't that important. But there are some fundamental parts of our lives that we just have to know. We have to be confident. We have to think about where our confidence lies. So two questions today that we're going to talk about who am I? And where am I going? We don't have any confusion over these two questions. Well, let's tackle the first question over in first, John three in verse one. Do we know who we are? In verse one at First John, it says, See what kind of love the Father has given to us, that we should be called children of God. And so we are get that that phrase there says and so we are. John says here and so we are another translation I saw said, and this and that is what we are exclamation point in that translation. And that is what we are. John had no confusion about who he was. And he expected those he wrote to to also not be confused, neither should we. We should not be confused on that question. First, Shawn two and verse three. It says in him by this, we know that we have come to know Him if we keep his commandments. So as we are followers of Christ as we are children of God, we should know him. How do we know him? By keeping His commandments? It's not a casual acquaintance, but a personal one, you know, there are degrees of knowing somebody.

Kevin Stinson  09:46
If you have a sibling, that's real close in age. You likely know that sibling, some twins out in the audience. You likely know that sibling very well, right? Or maybe if there's just you know, 14 months, 18 months, something really short, you know that sibling very well. And some of you have siblings that are 12 years old or 15 years older, much larger gap in that age. And you don't know that sibling quite as well, you know, sometimes they refer to him is more like an uncle or an aunt, really then a sibling, that relationship is just not quite as close. When we think about knowing our Father, we need to understand what type of relationship do we have? Is this a casual acquaintance? That we sorta know more about him? That we think we know a little bit? what degree do we know our Father, we need to strive for this close relationship with God. And in verse three here, John says, to truly know God, we need to submit to His will and keep His commandments. That's the key. Submitting to him keeping His commandments helps us to truly know our father. And first, Shawn for Look at Verse 15. And first John for see more about knowing who we are and being close to our father. It says in verse 15, whoever confesses that Jesus is the Son of God, God abides in him, and he in God. So we have come to know and to believe that the love that God has for us, God is love. And Whoever abides in love abides in God, and God abides in him, by this as love perfected with with us, so that we may have confidence for the Day of Judgment. Because as he is so also, are we in this world, abiding as using this scripture here? What is the word abiding me? I mean, the word is used to describe a relationship. Well, what is an abode? It's a place that we live, right? It's our home, that's our abode. That's a place where we are well, does God Where does God live in this relationship while living in us? How does God live in us? Galatians two, in verse 20, Paul says, I have been crucified with Christ, it is no longer I who live, but Christ, who lives in me, well, how does Christ live in us? What could we say? What can somebody see about us to say that Christ is living in us? You know, there's that saying, apple doesn't fall from the tree. And, you know, a father son that, you know, when the sun is taken off some sort of characteristics or mannerisms that the Father has, we see that and we think, well, he's just like his father, or that phrase, she's or her mother's daughter. And seems like family's always, not always so kind. I don't know why but, but there's these different phrases and different things we can see about characteristics that we take of those were around, especially our parents, you know, of course, we may or may even look like them. But we may take on certain characteristics of our parents and kind of turn into them a little bit. Well, the son shares characteristics with the Father, we also share characteristics and should share them with our Father in heaven. In First John four in verse 17, there at the end of that it says, as he is, so also are we in the world as he is? So also are we in the world?

Kevin Stinson  13:31
Well, abiding, is the concept of God kind of moving in, right? He's moving in, have you ever had, some of you had a situation where your parents have moved in, that needed to come and to stay with you and maybe to take care? Or maybe there's different things that have gone on in your family, and, and somebody has moved in? You know, there's that, you know, thought about, you know, whether your mother in law, or your father in law, or somebody moves in and, and just to make the statement, I've got the best mother in law in the world. So sorry, you don't have the best mother in law? Because I do. She's wonderful. And, you know, and to think about her moving in would be would be amazing. But sometimes we're not always so sure. We want people to move in with us. We're a little protective of that. We're not sure about somebody moving in, do we really want God to move in? You know, there were some bracelets and some of you may still wear them. And there was this, this kind of a phrase that we used to think about what would Jesus do? And it was kind of a helpful phrase to think about whatever situation we're in. Let's make sure we're asking ourselves that question. What would Jesus do in this situation, something that kind of helped us? Well, you know, that would be the concept of God moving in, is what would God do? What would Jesus do? If he were us at this point? Faced with this temptation faced with this opportunity, faced with some available time on our hands are available resources financially, what would Jesus do? With that, when we are alone in temptation comes, if God has moved in and He abides with us and in us, we will be thinking about him and able to resist temptation, temptation, seeing what he did when he was tempted, and that he resisted it. You know, many times we compartmentalize God, we think in terms of during church, or certain times that God abides in us, when we should be thinking that he abides in us all the time. You know, are there times that we are out in the world and maybe we even are possibly embarrassed to wear the name of Christ? Is that ever has that ever happened to you? Is it ever happened where you were almost embarrassed you and Mark 10, in verse 32, it says, so everyone who acknowledges me before men, I also will acknowledge before My Father who is in heaven, but whoever denies Me before men, I will also deny before my Father, Who is in heaven, when you think about that scripture, as we're out in the world, and as Christ abides in us as we think about the opportunities that we have, well, how do I really know that God abides in me? What can you describe Shakespeare without thinking about writing? Without thinking about the plays, and all the things that Shakespeare did? Could you could? Could you describe him without that? Could you describe John or Paul or Peter, that we read about? Could you describe them without mentioning Christ? It would be hard to describe them without mentioning Christ. Well, how would others describe us? Can others describe us without mentioning qualities of Christ? You know, how would they describe us? If you had some sort of interview session? And you got people that were close to you? And said, Could you describe? Kevin, could you describe this person? What kind of answer would they have? Would that would? Would that include qualities of Christ? Can others know or describe us without mentioning that if God abides in us, then we will be similar? And we will take on these qualities? So to summarize this section, this question, Who am I, we saw that we are His children and the as his children, we need to submit and obey to His will, His commands as we take on the characteristics of Christ, he is abiding in us. That's how we know who we are. Now, let's figure out where we're going. The second question. So if I was to ask in this room who wants to go to heaven, we're going to get 100%? You know, I'm quite confident of that. If we're to ask who thinks they're going to heaven? That's going to be a high percentage who thinks they're going to heaven? But then if I ask who knows they're going to heaven? You know, I think we struggle sometimes with that word. Who knows? We think of it. I think, in our everyday language, we think of knowing something is more that I've been there I've done that I've specifically had that experience. And sometimes maybe we struggle just kind of with that, that phrase of knowing something.

Kevin Stinson  18:19
But what does God desire for us in this level of confidence of where we're going, we can see in the Scripture more about our destination, we should have a high degree of confidence. We were told where we are going, if we are obedient. In First John five, in first John five verse, look at verse 11. We can see confidence in our destination. Starting in verse 11. And this is that testimony, God has given us eternal life. And this life is in His Son, whoever has the Son has life, whoever does not have the Son of God does not have life. I have written these things to you, who believe in the name of the Son of God, so that you may know that you have eternal life. So where we are going, as sons of God, as children of God, we have eternal life. And look at first John for one chapter earlier there in verse 16. We again see more about this confidence of where we are going, it says, so we have come to know and to believe the love that God has for us. God is love. And Whoever abides in love abides in God, and God abides in him. By this is love perfected with us, so that we may have confidence for the day of judgment, because as he is also because as he is so also are we in the world, there is no fear in love, but perfect love casts out fear, for fear has to do with punishment, Whoever fears has not been perfected in love. We see here in this scripture, that we may have confidence for the A day of judgment. What's the basis of our confidence? Is the fact that we are like Christ, that we take on these characteristics. So are we are we like Christ? Do we have that level of confidence in where we are going? When I know who I am, and I live that way, I know where I'm going. God has promised it. I may not have confidence always in myself in certain aspects of my daily life and the things that I do on a daily basis, but I can have confidence in God, we know that God is faithful. We see that over and over. And first John two in verse 24. If you look at that, it says, Let what you heard from the beginning abide in you, if what you heard from the beginning abides in you, then you too, will abide in the sun, and in the Father. And in verse 25, it says, And this is the promise that he made to us eternal life. Eternal life is the promise that God has made to us, He is faithful, to fulfill that promise. Turn over to First John two and we'll look at verse 28. We recently had something at at a my workplace where we had a big kind of meeting all afternoon type meeting, and there was a person invited that was, I've never heard this, but a magician storyteller was the person. And it was very interesting. And he started out, you know, a magician is going to look for a volunteer. And so he started out and he said something about he wanted to volunteer from the crowd. He said, As soon as I said that everybody's head went down, and no one wanted to have eye contact with him right to come up on stage. They shied away from that. And it was a fun, funny moment in his talk, but let's look at verse 28. of First John to his isn't now little children abide in Him so that when He appears, we may have confidence, and not shrink from him, in shame at his calming. That is not where we need to be, and should be by any means. What a What a scary and, and terrifying thought that we would shy away at that moment.

Kevin Stinson  22:17
Well, so if this is where we are going, we are like him in life. And we will be like Him in the resurrection. We know that we're going, we're going to have eternal life that we're going to be with him in first, John three in verse two, says, Beloved, we are God's children now. And what we will be has not yet appeared. But we know that when He appears, we shall be like Him, because we shall see Him as He is, when He appears, we will be like Him. That's what the future holds for us. And Colossians three, verse one. It says, Therefore, since you have been raised with Christ, strive for the things above, look at this phrase as the way it's written, strive for the things above. And then it says, where Christ is seated at the right hand of God, where we want to be to Set your minds on things above, not on earthly things, this concept of striving for things above, do, we truly have our mind set on things above, not just thinking about it, but have that as our goal as our target? I know many of you know that, that Shannon recently completed a degree in nursing. And so I was just consistently amazed over the past couple of years that she would get up on a Saturday 9am She will get her coffee, she's became highly interested in coffee. Over the past couple of years, she would get a cup of coffee, and she was are studying on a Saturday a perfectly good Saturday, and would study throughout the day, and like all day, and then at night, it's time to go to bed and and it just amazed me she was very dedicated. And it was it was really inspiring to see somebody who had their study habits and was dedicated to that even though it wouldn't be easy, right? It'd be very easy to get distracted and have some of the we call them distract Oh powers at the house, and to be distracted in something I'm really good at that I have a lot of powers in that area. But she was able to show a dedication that we need to think about in our lives as Christians are we dedicated? Are we striving for things above that we set our minds on that above? Do we have a mindset that nothing's gonna stop us? No matter what it is, nothing's going to stop us from reaching that destination. Are we striving for treasures in heaven? Or are we striving for treasures here where we read that moth and rust will corrupt? That thieves will break in and steal? What is our mind set on? So we know where we are going here. You know, how do we feel? We have have eternal life that's in our future, we're going to be with our Father in heaven. Are we excited about this? There's a many here that went to on a hike this past week, that some that are I know that are still gone as well. But as you were looking forward to that hike, I know you're excited about it. I know when I've been before, you're excited about this opportunity to go to this destination? Are we excited about our destination? Do we think about that in the same way, or, or at least a similar way, that we're excited about being in heaven, being with our father, living eternally with him. Paul said in Philippians, I am hard pressed between the two is thinking about continuing to live here in this life, or going on and being with his father. He said, I'm hard pressed between the two My desire is to be is to depart and be with Christ. For that is far better. Your thought about that phrase there? You know what? How would you even write that he put, it's far better the way we have that translated, let that sink in. Far better. That's where our destination is. That's where we're going. We should have confidence in that. One closing in summary, from this lesson, I want to just think about the concept of that we can and should have confidence as a Christian, there's no reason for us not to be confident. We are children of God, we are reborn in the image of Christ. We know who we are. That's who we are. If you're to introduce yourself, in different in different formats, there might be different reasons for the context. But ultimately, we know who we are. We are children of God. It's pretty straightforward, have an answer for us. That's who we are. All these other things that we have in relationships and careers are secondary. We are children of God. And we know where we are going as a child of God, I want to be with my father doesn't every child want to be with their parent.

Kevin Stinson  27:11
They want to be we want to be with our Father. We know that is far better than where we are now. So we know where we are going. Remember that puzzle we talked about? When we started the jigsaw puzzle, that there weren't all the pieces there. God is faithful, we see that over and over. We can trust in God. He has all the pieces to the puzzle. We can we can live this life. As children of his we can be obedient. We can be fulfilled in knowing that we are serving Him and that our eternal destination is to be with him and that he is waiting for us. Let's become a Christian to be become confident you first have to take on the name of Jesus. In baptism. You have to put the old person of sin behind you and to have your sins washed away. If there may be some here this morning that have been thinking about that, that are convinced that that's the step that they need to take. This will be a wonderful opportunity if anyone at all in the audience is subject to that invitation. Please come forward as we stand and sing
