Good morning. We have a packed house today, many people, it's good to see you. I'll echo Jacobs thoughts any day that we can come here and worship God is a good day. So I'm glad to be here with you. I appreciate the fact that you've taken time to worship God with me. And I appreciate that very much. This time, we're going to be opening up our Bibles and studying from a portion of God's Word. If you would open your Bibles to Second Timothy chapter three. Second Timothy chapter three. And I'd like to read verses one through nine in just a moment. Second Timothy three

Jeremy Sweets  00:48
this morning, I'd like to talk about the subject me too. And the Christian. This is a subject that you've probably heard about, you've probably seen in the media, in fact, just a couple days ago was kind of the year anniversary since this took place at the beginning of this movement. So let me just run down through this and then we'll look at Second Timothy chapter three. So what is the me to movement? On October 5 2017, The New York Times broke a story and where Ashley Judd accused media mogul Harvey Weinstein of sexual assault. It was a couple of days later that Alyssa Milano wrote the statement if you've been sexually harassed or assaulted, right, me too as a reply to this tweet. And many people did and many people responded to that. One of those was a gymnast, McKayla Maroney, who accused Larry Nasser or the the doctor for the United States the Olympics of abuse or assault. 265 women joined Moroni, and he was later convicted to 60 years in federal prison. And April of this year, Bill Cosby was convicted of drugging and molesting women with accusations occurring over decades. And on September 25, just a few days ago, he was sentenced to three to 10 years for his crimes. accusations have touched the entertainment industry, news, television and politics. And I could list the names but I'm sure that you have you have heard of many of the names even in the recent politics with the Supreme Court nomination. So having stated what the subject is, you likely know what it's about. This is a little bit of a heavy sermon. And I want you to know that I don't take this lightly. I've been mulling this over for probably about a year since I heard about this. So this is not in response to anything that's happening in politics. Let me make a few disclaimers as I as I start. It should be noted that an accusation does not necessarily imply guilt. This movement has spread branched out and become politicized. And I'm not really addressing the many shoot offs, or the politics or the politicized movements that may have sprung out of this. I'm also not addressing or making any declarations on any single case, that's not my goal here this morning. But it seems clear to me, if we were to take a step back and look at this issue, that we would say there is a problem. And it is a problem affecting Christians. And it is a problem that should not be ignored. It's one that I feel great hesitancy to preach about. For one, we're in a large room with a mixed audience with many little ears. So I will do my best to be discreet. I will do my best to address this in an indirect way. Also know that this is a subject that is hidden in plain sight. We don't know about the many people that may have experienced this. There may be people here this morning that have experienced this and I know it's a traumatic subject. And so again, I don't take this lightly. But yet I feel compelled to address it, that we're not quiet or silent about this. Sin needs to be confronted head on. And so that is my goal in doing this. Also add that this affects men and women. This is maybe more directed toward women, particularly those that are powerless in society, but this affects both men and women. This also is not a new subject. In fact, in second Timothy chapter three, we're going to see many of the attitudes and actions sins of sinful actions that are prevalent today that has led in this direction. So what Open your Bibles to Second Timothy three and we'll be reading verses one through nine.

Jeremy Sweets  05:14
But understand this, that in the last days there will come times of difficulty for People will be lovers of self, lovers of money, proud, arrogant, abusive, disobedient to their parents, ungrateful, unholy, heartless, unappeasable, slanderous, without self control, brutal, not loving good, treacherous, reckless, swollen with conceit, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God, having the appearance, appearance of godliness but denying its power, avoid such people. For among them are those who creep into households and capture weak women burdened with sins and led astray by various passions, always learning and never able to arrive at a knowledge of the truth, just as Yanis and January's oppose Moses. So these men also oppose the truth, men corrupted in mind and disqualified regarding the faith, but they will not get very far for their folly will be playing to all it was that of two of those two men. I mentioned that this movement has been going on for about a year, and where people are becoming more open about this, but it is not a new subject that is not a new sin. In fact, you could fairly easily read through this list and feel like it's describing our times today, we live in a sinful world. And while culture may have some ebb and flow to their morality, people have not changed. There is still a battle being waged between those that would serve God and those that would serve themselves. We not only see that generally described in Second Timothy, but there are biblical voices that could say me too. This is a subject that that, quite frankly, is found often throughout Scripture. And I mentioned it's uneasy, so often we pass over the scriptures. But in Genesis chapter 19, we see that the visitors to Sodom and Gomorrah were subjected to this kind of abuse. Now it did not get carried through. But that was the desire of Sodom and Gomorrah, and no doubt they had done that before. We see Dinah and chapter 34. With Shechem, we see Joseph and Genesis 39, subjected to this kind of harassment and abuse. Thankfully, he took a stand against that and suffered the consequences. We see the Levites concubine and judges 19. The next two examples are those of people in positions of power where there may be some idea of consent. But regardless of that, they were people in positions of power. And it was quite sinful because of the actions that they took Eli sons were priest, and it says that they lay with the women at the Tent of Meeting at the door of the tent of meeting, David called Bathsheba, the king called this woman to himself, and adultery resulted. And we also see the example of Tamar, just a couple of chapters after David's sin. And second Samuel chapter 13. So there are biblical voices that could say me too, as well. So while this is a new movement, so to speak, it's nothing new visit, it's nothing new. Notice if you would that there are contributing factors that go into what takes place. Sexual abuse and assault doesn't just happen, but rather, sexual assault and abuse is a destination paved by a series of sinful attitudes and actions. Let me repeat that. This abuse is a destination paved by a series of sinful attitudes and actions. There are sinful attitudes that will lead up to this. And so those are some of the things that I want to address. We need to be aware of that. We need to be aware of these things and as Christians take a stand each step of the way. So the first one I would note is embracing error. We live in a society that has openly embraced error. In Second Timothy chapter three and verse five from the text we read, it talks about those that have an appearance of godliness, but they have denied the truth. They show like this is good, but it is not an ice day Isaiah is day said that there were those that call good evil and evil good. They flipped the script on what they are called polling is good. And that is true today. We live in a society that

Jeremy Sweets  10:08
that has mocked biblical principles. One of the things we've learned from this is that truth is not an academic exercise. It's not about getting the correct answers on some kind of test out there, or having trivial knowledge, it is not trivial whatsoever. Truth is the basis for our actions. You know, it's interesting, some people almost mocked the idea of doctrinal purity, but doctrinal purity is important, because it informs godly action. Truth is the basis for our actions, it sets the parameters for right or wrong, it trains and guides our moral compass our conscience, which is the very defense that God has given us against immorality. We live in a culture that has marked marriage marked sexual purity. It was not too long ago that they talked about sexual freedom. And what they meant by that is being able to have a sexual relationship in a casual way with anyone that you might come across outside the constraints or the bounds of marriage, so that you are free to have that relationship at any time that you would like. Matthew 19 teaches, and I'll not read through that. But Jesus tells us that God's desire is not for divorce. God's desire is not for broken marriages. God's desire is that one man and one woman, when they make the commitment of marriage, that that would be a lifetime commitment. Men are not to put that asunder men or women, that's what God wants, that that is good. But have you noticed that that is not what the world calls good today, they talk about the freedom to be able to live outside those constraints to be able to have any relationship that they want. How common is to hear about those that are cohabitating together moving in together or simply having a casual relationship. When I was younger, there were sitcoms and shows that that made this the absolute norm. Friends Seinfeld, you can think of any shows today. As we come to the day, there's probably not a single show that presents the alternative that it is good and right to wait until marriage. And that's sad. Those in the those many in Hollywood, I don't want to lay a blanket statement, but simply mock marriage. Marrying either three, four or five times are saying I see no need for marriage, I see no, no good that comes out of it. We live in a world that has embraced air, and that's affecting Christians. And so we need to uphold the truth of the gospel. Error leads to sinful action. And we need to be aware of that. And Hebrews 13 And verse four, it says, Let marriage be held and honor among all and let the marriage bed be undefiled. For God will judge sexually immoral and adulterous. Notice that it says that marriage is to be held in honor. I believe that's true today. Marriage is honorable, it is a commitment. It carries with it the qualities that are necessary that come from the very heart of God. We also see that the marriage bed is to be undefiled. That commitment together involves the sexual relationship. And that is a blessing from God inside of marriage. The tech says that God will judge the sexually immoral and the adulterous, those that are immoral in their activity, those that carry on this activity outside of marriage, as well as those that break the covenant toward the commitment of marriage through adultery. They will be judged. The world has embraced to error and I believe that that has contributed to this movement. We also see a great practice of selfishness of selfishness. Again, we know this is nothing new. This is at the heart of sin itself. But we live in a culture that desires immediate gratification. We live in a culture that glorifies the self. It is better to be happy than to do what somebody else says is right or what some god they would say says is right. It is better that you pursue what you want. Well, that's led to a lot of problems. Because we want sin Don't wait. unchecked. That's the truth of it. We simply want sin. And so

Jeremy Sweets  15:10
it's going to lead to a lot of harmful practices. In Second Timothy chapter three in verses two through four. It says, For People will be lovers of self, lovers of self, lovers of money, proud, arrogant, abusive. And it goes on to say, without self control, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God. And so we see the great problem here of practicing selfishness. In Matthew chapter 15. Matthew chapter 15, we see that Jesus talks about where sin comes from. The truth is that sin comes from our heart. Barry's talking to those Pharisees that had rebuked him and his disciples for not washing their hands. And Jesus says, it's not what goes into a man it's not through unclean hands and eating food that really makes you to find what truly makes you defiled is your heart and what comes out of your heart. Let me read that list. I was going to just talk about it but Matthew chapter 15. And notice that passage, Matthew 15 and verse 18, but what comes out of the mouth proceeds from the hearts and this the files of person. For out of the heart come evil thoughts, murder, adultery, sexual immorality, theft, false witness, slander, these are what defile a person, but he with unwashed hands does not defile anyone. Here we see that people make a practice today of choosing the passing pleasures of sin. Just as we see that Moses looked over or chose to endure ill treatment with the people of God rather than the passing pleasures of sin. That's still a choice to make. And many people have chosen the passing pleasures. We live in a culture that's called the me generation. Now in part that's a bad rap, because I think almost every generation can be described in that way, because selfishness is at the heart of sin. But yet we live in a time when it's almost encouraged, to be focused on yourself. And that has consequences. That has consequences. I believe that is a contributing factor to the many cases that we have heard about. The valuing and objectifying is a contributing case, a contributing case, factor. We live in a culture that has become consumed with lust. The Bible talks to us about love, but our culture has become consumed with lust. In Second Timothy three verses two and four talks about those that are abusive, those that are treacherous and how they deal with other people. We see that people are devaluing others. Now this comes from selfishness as it is directed toward others. Philippians two and verse three says Do nothing out of selfish ambition or conceit, but in humility, count others more significant than yourselves. I mentioned that we live in a culture that for far too long has practice devaluing and objectifying. That is really the heart of part of the problem here. First Corinthians 13 Four says love is not self seeking. So let me if we are to place lust and love side by side, lust is self seeking. Lust will use others for its own game. Lust does not look out for what is good for others and the benefit of others last only consider self. If you think about it, that's the exact opposite of the gospel message of what God has done. sacrificial love sacrificing self for others, and we see that in what God has done for us. Yes, we live in a culture that has elevated last. The timing on this is interesting, but it was just a few days before this, me too movement got started that Hugh Hefner passed away, September 27 2017.

Jeremy Sweets  20:12
He was a man that you probably know was with the Playboy magazine and again, he he touted this, liberating this freeing kind of atmosphere. Steven Galloway, who's a simply reporter had an article. I'm not sure how to say it better than this. No matter how much you want to romanticize him, his legacy is this sexism, stereotyping and objectification. Women were not valued for their hearts, but rather for their bodies alone. Looking good, was the only standard of judgment. And that is not helpful. That leads to a society and a generation that have grown up, imbibing this lustful heart, this lustful attitude and this attitude that says that I will take what I want. It's about what is pleasing to Me, rather than what is good. And I believe that devaluing others, objectifying others turning people instead of a person into an object. I believe that is certainly a contributing factor. In Matthew five, verses 27 through 30, we see that Jesus addressed this, he says, You have heard that it was said you shall not commit adultery. But I say to you that everyone who looks at a woman with lustful intent has already committed adultery with her in his heart. If your right eye causes you to sin, tear it out and throw it away, for it is better that you lose one of your members than your whole body be thrown into hell. And if your right hand causes you to sin, cut it off and throw it away. Further, it's better that you lose one of your members than your whole body go into hell, Jesus addressed this last and it's something that needs to be addressed. It has no place in the heart of a disciple, it should not be allowed to run free, it must be checked, self control, must be exercised. And I'm sure you know, it must be exercise today, as much as ever. Access to pornography is freely available, hundreds and 1000s of sites, hundreds of 1000s of sites, billion dollar industry, Satan is gunning for us. And we must stand up against the we must be prepared, we must realize the path that we join if we walk that way. It's not a simple action, but it is a path. It is destructive to the mind. It turns people into objects rather than people. And it is extremely dangerous. Those that have imbibed this have developed an attitude that, quite frankly, is dangerous. And it leads to many people having to say me too.

Jeremy Sweets  23:15
We also see that there are those that abuse authority, abuse authority. You know, we often talk about respecting authority, and I think that's good, that's necessary. We need to teach our children to respond to authority in an appropriate manner, just as we should to the governing authorities and those that we find ourselves under. But it is also important that those in authority, respect the position of authority, so that they would not abuse their position. In Second Timothy chapter three, in verse two, it talks about those that were disobedient to parents, this obedience to parents. We see that Jesus condemned those that were the religious leaders that practiced hypocrisy. In Matthew 23 and verse two, he tells the disciples to listen to what they say, but don't imitate their example because they preach but do not practice. They're hypocritical. Those that are in a position of authority are not practicing what they preach, and that can be extremely dangerous. And James chapter three and verse one. Not many of you should become teachers, my brother for you know that we who teach will be judged with greater strictness. Now understand that passage talks about the tongue and chance to do a good job this morning. I'm talking about that. And the tongue is so important here. But I think we can extend that principle also to our actions and to what we do. So we see that those That's lead. And in one sense, that's all Christians, isn't it? We lead in godliness. We tell others what is right. And so we will be held to that standard. But it's particularly true for those that are in positions of power and authority. The US gymnasts doctor was a teacher, instructor, a doctor, one that was over many young girls, and he took advantage of his position. We hear of school teachers today. Sadly, it's hard to imagine, but they take advantage of their position of authority. How many churches have you heard that were destroyed? Through an elders, sinful action? A preachers, sinful action, adultery, sexual immorality, leaders are certainly not immune. But the damage that comes from it is great. It is great indeed. The prophets, we can go through many of the prophets, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Amos, Zachariah, Micah, all of these prophets can do those that were in a position of leadership and took advantage of those of which they were supposed to be leading. And so we see today that there are many that have abused their authority. And that attitude that would take advantage of the helpless is so very dangerous, so very dangerous. And I believe that it's a contributing factor that that leads to many people having to say, Me, too.

Jeremy Sweets  26:46
So let me close with a charge for Christians. So that's what we see in the world. What are we to do? Well, as I mentioned, there is a pathway of sin that leads to this action, maybe not every contributing factors involved, but I believe that there's a package deal that often is associated with this. And we need to take a stand for what is right and what is true, first of all, by upholding the truth of God's word, preaching the truth. Now, we understand the great importance of practicing what we say but we can't let go with either one, can we we need to preach and practice and uphold the truth. Today, as I mentioned, those that would take a stand for what is right are mocked. I think of Tim Tebow as one that says that I was going to wait till marriage, and he was roasted. He was mocked. People were incredulous. They could not believe how ridiculous and backwards this person was. That's what we're standing up against. And we may look backwards, but we're gonna have to look backwards. We're gonna side with God and His Word, and the truths. In first Peter one in verse 22, we see that the truth is something that we have obeyed and the obedience of the truth. Paul stated very simply, in Second Corinthians six and verse seven, we faithfully preach the truth. Not only that, but that was his charge to Timothy, if you remember in Second Timothy chapter four, his his closing statements there to Timothy, preach the Word. Be ready in season and out of season, reprove, rebuke, exhort with great patience and instruction, we see that we must uphold the truth of God's we're not only that, but we must choose God over self. This is an ongoing, continual challenge. And Christians must continually in an ongoing basis, evaluate themselves and see if selfishness is winning over God. And James for in verse seven. It says, Submit yourselves therefore to God, resist the devil and he will flee from you. draw nearer to God and He will draw near to you. Cleanse your hands you sinners and purify your hearts, you double minded. be wretched and mourn and weep let your laughter be turned to morning and your joy to gloom. Humble yourselves therefore before the Lord and He will exalt you.

Jeremy Sweets  29:25
Life is not about entitlement. Life doesn't owe us but rather we have earned something and that is death. Let us not act with arrogance and selfishness in this life. Let us understand that God must be chosen above all else. Let us also value people, value people. We can be so superficial at times, you probably know what superficial means. That which is on the outside, we make so many of our judgments based upon what is on the out song. But we need to remember that God values all people. In the beginning in Genesis chapter one and verse 27, God said, we're in verse 26, Let us make man in our image after our likeness. People are made in the image of God and bear value, and worse. We also see in First Samuel chapter 16, says, The Lord said the same will do not look on his appearance or on the height of his stature, because I've rejected him. For the Lord sees not as man sees, but looks on Man looks on the outward appearance, but the Lord looks on the heart. Let us not be superficial, let us not judge women by their bodies or men by their bodies. After all, that is really insignificant in the scheme of things. God is not going to put us on the scales, God is not going to judge us based upon our body or the look of our body. God is going to judge us based upon our hearts, the actions that we have carried out, let us imitate God's heart in this. So many things lead in the opposite direction. Let us value all people. In First Peter chapter three and verse seven, it makes a special case that women should be honored and valued. Likewise, husbands live with your wives and an understanding way, showing honor to the woman as the weaker vessel, since they are heirs with you of the grace of life, so that your prayers may not be hindered. Here, the weaker vessel is really something that should be thought of as something that is special, something that is to be honored. We see maybe a thought of this, I know others have used this illustration of of China, where the good were that you get out, it's not for everyday use. But it's something that is good and precious and special. Women are to be viewed in this way. Not only that, but we see that women are to be seen as a player's fellow heir of the grace of life.

Jeremy Sweets  32:13
Women, they have different roles in society. In the church and different things, we have different roles, but they do not have lesser value. They've never had lesser value, God has always valued them. And it is sinful to think otherwise and act otherwise. That's not only true of women, that's true of each and every person isn't it. Culture invents new ways to look down upon groups of people to devalue others. And Christians far too often buy into that. We're persuaded by that we begin to judge people in the same way. Let us not judge as the world judges, but let us judge as God judges and consider the heart. Let us also practice integrity, integrity as Christians but also integrity in leadership. And Hebrews chapter 13, and verse seven. There it says, Remember, your leaders, those who spoke to you the Word of God, consider the outcome of their way of life and imitate their face. Elders are supposed to be those that should be imitated, and that can only happen if they are living godly lives. In fact, in First Timothy chapter three, we see that this is one of the prerequisites or qualities or characteristics that were to see an elders, if anyone aspires to the Office of overseer, he desires a noble task. Therefore, an overseer must be above reproach. And so we see the importance here of integrity. Now, the scripture here that I've been using talks about elders, but that's true for any in positions of authority. That's true for teachers. That's true. If you're serving as a law enforcement official. That's true for parents. You have authority over your children and you can abuse that power, or you can use it in a good and helpful way. So let us practice integrity and leadership. One other passage with this in first Timothy chapter five and verse two, Paul's He instructs Timothy the evangelists. Notice how he says that he is to treat others do not rebuke an older man, but encourage him as you would a father. Younger men as brothers, older women, as mothers, younger women as sisters, in all purity. Notice that he addresses each group of people and says that they are to be treated like family in a loving way, not with arrogance, not as if I'm the preacher, I've got the right answers and you beat them over the head with no that's not the way at all. You're with have family here. And you should carry that attitude. Notice particularly what he says to the young Timothy as how he should treat younger women. He says, the younger women as sisters, but he adds a phrase there in all purity, and all purity. And that's an important phrase to add. Timothy was being warned here. And I know he was, doesn't appear to be an elder. He was an evangelist, but he was one that was leading in the teaching there. And he tells him to practice purity as you are treating others. And that's important because elders evangelist often are addressing sinful situations. And people are coming with broken hearts, reaching out and yearning for something that is good. And if all they've experienced is something that is bad, they might try to attach themselves physically to that person. That would be true of men, women, whatever the situation there, and that that's a danger. So you see the susceptibility, but you see equally the importance, as you think about the great damage that can occur. If if those desires are allowed free reign. Me too. And the Christian I think is a subject we need to think about. me close by saying that God loves all people. There are no throw away people so to speak, we throw away a lot of stuff, don't we we get packaging, Amazon packages, the boxes and containers. We throw away a lot of stuff. But there are no throw away people. God gives voice to those that are victims, those that are oppressed, those that cry out to Him and rely upon Him. God gives them voice and he hears them. He doesn't treat them like throwaway people.

Jeremy Sweets  37:00
God doesn't want perpetrators and sinners to be thrown away either. But rather he calls upon them to turn to the Lord. God wants all people to turn to Him. God sent His Son to die on the cross for the world for all people. It may be that you're here this morning, and you're not a Christian, you're not living as you should. You see that. What the world offers, is lacking and provides no substance. God offers a wiping away of sin, and a future home with Him in Heaven. We must believe that Jesus is the Christ, we must turn away from our sins, confessing that Jesus is the Christ, and be baptized in the water for the forgiveness of our sins. It may be that you're a Christian and you're not living as you should. It may be that sins are hidden. And no one else knows that you're not living as you should. But God knows. And you need to make your life right. And there's no better time than right now. There's no better time than today. I'm not saying you have to come forward in front of everybody. Although you're welcome to We will pray with you. And for you. It may be that you need to talk to the elders. It may be that you need to say there's sin in my life and I need help. I need prayers do that. Reach out to fellow Christians. That's why God has placed us here for one another. There's any subject to the invitation. Please come as we stand and sing at this time.
