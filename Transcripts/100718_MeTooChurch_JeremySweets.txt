Good evening. It's good to see everyone here again tonight, I appreciate the fact that you're here to worship with me. Our goal at Broadmoor is to give God glory and honor and praise and all that we do. And so we're seeking to do that both with inside these walls, but also as we leave. So if you're visiting with us, we're glad you're here. We're glad you're you have come to worship with us. I'd like to continue actually the sermon that we talked about this morning, this morning, we talked about me too, and the church. Me too, is a movement that started that accused others of sexual assault. And it started in October of 2017. And I'll repeat some of my reminders, as I deal with this subject. And that is I'm not looking to look at a particular case or address guilt in any particular case, understand that some accusations may not be true. And so an accusation does not equal guilt. I also understand that this movement has taken many different directions, and I'm not trying to deal with those are their directions. But what this does tell me is that there are many people that are facing this problem. And it's something that the church needs to address as well, we need to talk about this. It's not something that we should hide. This morning, we looked at really contributing factors along the way, how does someone get to the point of which they would commit sexual assault? Well, I believe there are many factors that shape, that ultimate decision, and Christians need to be aware of those. And Christians need to individually address those dealing with the heart and purity and having the mind of God and the character of God looking to God's word as truth and being guided in that all Christians need to be careful and be watchful about these things. And so I talked about that more or less from an individual basis. Tonight, I'd like to talk about me too, in the church, and almost changed the subject to sin and the church. In some ways, this is really a springboard issue, we really could be covering any sin. But I think it's helpful to talk about this one in particular, because it is one that is not often talked about, it's not comfortable. And so I at least want to make sure we're talking about this, but I do think it has broader application. As we look at this subject, in First Timothy chapter three, and verse 15. First Timothy, chapter three and verse 15, while reverse 14, as well says, I hope to come to you soon, but I'm writing these things to you so that if I delay, you may know how one ought to behave in the household of God, which is the church of the living God, a pillar and buttress of the truth. Notice, there are three statements given about the church here. He says that one may know how to conduct himself in the household of God. God's Church is a household of the children of God that relate to one another as brothers and sisters, we look to God as our head of the household. And so there's something very communal, there's a closeness that is associated with the church. Not only is it the household of God, but it says it is the church, the assembly of the living God, the assembly of the living God, the church has been meeting for 1000s of years. And it's not a outdated assembly. It's not a dead assembly, but rather it's an Assembly of God, who is alive, who is living, and well, that is the church of which Paul was talking about. But notice his third description there. He says the churches the pillar and buttress or pillar and foundation or support of the truth, at the heart of what the church is to be, it is a truth oriented group, those that are upheld by truth, that have been built upon truth. That's who they are. They are people that that have as their foundation. They can claim who they are, and they really can't describe that without talking about truth. We are Christians, followers of God and we are built upon truth, but not only that, but the churches to be the the buttress or the

Jeremy Sweets  04:48
that which comes from the church. It is not only part of what has made us who we are, but it is part of what we do. It's part of what we ascribe to it's part of of what we Speak out. And so the church must be that which addresses truth. And that's true of all sins of all sins. And so we're going to talk about really, how should the church be dealing with sin in general, and even particular, this sin that often gets hidden over. We need to know first of all that this movement that started off as a, I don't say a secular kind of movement, but it was looking at those in movies, and media and things like that. Well, there were those that said that this had occurred in the church as well. So there's a couple of very well known instances of this, from 2001 to 2010, the Catholic Church has considered sex abuse allegations involving 3000 priests dating back 50 years, and we've all heard of the sex scandal of the Catholic Church. And we know that that is something that that has occurred. And we're saddened by that fact. Willow Creek Church, which is one of the largest mega churches in the country, I think it's in Chicago with over 25,000 people. Bill Hybels and his entire leadership staff resigned in August of this year, over unaddressed allegations of sexual misconduct, for something that had been occurring for five years. I make those statements because they're well known. And no, we're not the Catholic Church. And we're not some kind of mega church, nor are we trying to be. But as we look at that, we see that it is inside churches where some of these things are happening. And so what should Broadmoor do about that? What should we be aware of what should we be striving for? As we consider this subject, many people began to say church to some of the world will say, See, they're, they're all a bunch of hypocrites. They're all a bunch of sinners to they are no better than we are. And we need to make sure we know how to address those things. There is sin from those inside the church. And that's not something we should hide, put our head in the sand, pretend doesn't exist. If we're to be a pillar in support of the truth. That's not only the truth of the gospel, but the truth of the reality of who we are, of what's happening. So we don't need to smooth things over and say, we want to look like we're perfect. That's not the gospel message. Come and be perfect. We are striving for growth. As Christians, we fall from time to time, and we just simply need to be honest about that. And so yes, it's occurred in the Catholic Church and mega churches. But what I want to say is, it's something that can happen here as well. We need not hide our head in the sand about that subject. As we look at the church, we see that the church is not a country club for the well to do. It's not a country club for those that are perfect, but rather the church is a hospital for the sick. Open your Bibles if you would the first Corinthians chapter six, verses nine through 11. First Corinthians chapter six, verses nine through 11.

Jeremy Sweets  08:47
Here Paul says, or do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the kingdom of God? Do not be deceived neither the sexually immoral nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor men who practice homosexuality, nor thieves, nor the greedy nor drunkards, nor revisers, nor swindlers will inherit the kingdom of God. And such were some of you, but you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ, and by the Spirit of our God. We know that scripture talks about those that are part of the church, they've put to death, that old man and that old land is one of sin. And that's why Paul can say here such were some of you. And as we look through this list, we see a rather scary list. Don't wait. And really, you could put any sin in there. You could put any sin in there now might not apply to a particular group, but Christians have committed every sin under the sun and come out of that. They've been converted from that lifestyle. And so we need To understand that the church here consists of those that have been sinners, committed heinous sins, sins that will turn your stomach sins that that make you shudder. And so we see here that the church consists of those that were in that category. Notice in verse 11, the beauty of the gospel message. And such were some of you notice the past tense use of that those sins have not defined them forevermore. But he says, such were some of you, you were sanctified, or you were washed, you were sanctified, you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ. And so the beauty of the gospel message is that the blood of Christ can wash away the guilt of those sins, it can wash away, the death that has to come about because of those sins. Now, it may not wash away all the consequences. Sin has a far reaching effect, and consequences can last a lifetime. We see that with David, don't we? who bore many of the consequences of his own sin in his life, even though he was forgiven of those sin. And so we see from First Corinthians chapter six, that there are those that have been in sin that come to be part of the church. We also know that once you come to be a part of God's body, you're not automatically perfect. Now you have a different mindset, you're to be committed in a different direction. But when you come to be a child of God, you're wiped clean, you're washed, clean, but you're not perfect. Meaning that there still may be the case that you would stumble, and that you were fall, and the Bible addresses things like that. So we need to be aware, we need to be aware that this is the case, we need to understand that there are people that come to the gospel that have had very difficult lives because of sin. And not only that, but because of oppression of sin. And so there may be and I don't know of any specific case, I'm certainly not trying to address this or cause you to go around question people or being suspicious of people. That's not what I'm saying. But what I am saying is that sin is prevalent. Sin is prevalence. And we need not be shocked if sin is going on, among those that have been Christians. And so that's the first thing that I would say, we need to be prepared for the fact that there may be both victims and perpetrators that are part of the body of Christ. And I say that you may know of examples or situations, there's one particular situation that's fairly close to home that I'll say I know about. This person was saying for many years as a godly man, he was seen as someone that had the preachers over he was known as someone that was good. But in his home, he was not. And so that exists. And that happens, and we need not hide our face from that fact. We need to be honest. And so part of First Timothy chapter three, three and verse 15, being a pillar of support of the truth, I believe, involves preaching the truth. And we talked about this, that this morning, and so I won't belabor that point. We need to speak the truth. We need to speak what is truth, but we also need to acknowledge the truth about who we are. Let us not pretend that we're something that we're not, let's be honest about our sins and what has happened there. Not only that, but in Second Timothy chapter three. Second Timothy, chapter three and verse 16. There it says, All Scripture is inspired of God and profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness, that the man of God may be complete, equipped for every good work. All Scripture is inspired of God. So let me just add that we need to use all of God's word. I mentioned that there are many stories that, quite frankly, are uncomfortable in the Old Testament. I'm not saying we need to read those in the public assembly and go into detail in the public assembly. That's certainly not what I'm suggesting. But what I am saying is those are stories that are there for a reason and they're not to be skipped over because they're uncomfortable.

Jeremy Sweets  14:49
No, I've not personally had to deal with those things. I'd rather not think about it quite honestly, I don't watch the news because I don't like bad news. It's much easier for me now. got to deal with the blackness of sin. But as long as we're in this world, we're gonna have to deal with that, we're gonna have to see the pain that it causes. And we're trying to lend a helping hand and point people to God. So in part that's not all bad isn't. We're not trying to be consumed about by it, certainly. And we're not trying to commit sin. But we are trying to point people to God. So as the church, let us be honest, speak the truth. Feagins for in verse 15, says, speaking the truth in love. And so that is what we want to do. The church is going to consist of people that have been sinners, hardened sinners. And they've been washed from that and come and have a different commitment. But it also consists of those that are not perfect, and will make bad decisions and sin and commit sin. So if that's the case, we need to be a people that receives sinners. fact that should be a regular part of our message, calling out to the world come out of sin, come to the Gospel, come to God. It can wash you from that, you know, the world is very unsatisfying in what it offers. The gospel is far superior. We have good news in a bad and wicked world, and we need to proclaim it. But we shouldn't be surprised that people come through the doors with problems. entrenched in sin in quicksand, as it were almost, you know, by the day going down further and further and further, we shouldn't be surprised by that. But rather, we need to be a people that would welcome others in their situations, calling them out of that, in Romans chapter 15, in verses one through seven. Notice what it says there Romans 15, verses one through seven. We who are strong, have an obligation to bear with the failings of the weak, and not to please ourselves, let each of us please his neighbor for his good to build him up. For Christ did not please himself. But as it is written, the reproaches of those who approached you fell on me, for whatever was written in former days was written for our instruction, that through endurance, and through the encouragement of the scriptures, we might have hope. May the God of endurance and encouragement grants you to live in such harmony with one another, in accord with Christ Jesus, that together you may with one voice glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. Therefore welcome one another as Christ as welcome you for the glory of God. When we start with that last phrase, that he says, Welcome one another as Christ as welcomed you for the glory of God. We are to welcome those that have been welcomed by God. As I mentioned, God welcomes the hardened sinner doesn't. And we need to welcome them as well. Anybody that God would accept, needs to be someone that we would accept. And we also need to understand that we were in that situation of being lost in sin. And since we have been accepted, we need to accept others in that condition. Notice also the goal, just to step back a verse back, it is that we would live together in harmony. Now, people that are entrenched in sin don't automatically step out of those patterns of lifestyles that they've been living in for so long. And so this is a process but the goal is to live together in harmony with one another, in a chord with Christ Jesus, that we may with one voice glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, many voices that have been very sinful and had turned their backs on God can come together in the church and unite them together, speaking the same thing, glorifying the same God proclaiming the same message. And that's a beautiful thing. That's a very beautiful thing. Notice also part of what is to happen here from Romans chapter 15.

Jeremy Sweets  19:30
He says, We who are strong have an obligation to bear with the failings of the weak and not to please ourselves. Now, in part, this goes back to doctrinal disputes from Romans chapter 14, where he talks about the weak group and the strong group and and their understanding of days and meats. But let me just extend this beyond that doctrinal dispute, to to speak in general terms. We have an obligation to bear With the failings of the weak, those that are new converts, those that are struggling with sin, those that are having problems, we must and should bear with their failings, not seeking to please ourselves. I hope I'm not making taking that out of context, bear with our failings, I know it's different subject. I know there's, there's a difference there. But we're to bear with one another, not ignoring their sin. That's not the case at all. But understanding, understanding their situation. And he says, Let each of us please his neighbor for his good to build him up. And so as we receive sinners, we need to consider their situation. We need to seek to understand them to know how we can build them up and edify them. There was someone that was a perpetrator of a sexual Chrome, what could we do that would build that person up? What could help? Now receiving again, does not mean ignoring what has happened. But we should strive as a church to do what we can to help them what may that help look like? I'm not exactly sure. But we need to be prepared for sinners to be a part of the church and welcome them and understand that they have many sins that must be dealt with. And so we should seek to build that person up. What about someone that is a victim of a sexual crime? We need to, as the tech says is where well, they're going to have difficulties and struggles, we need to be aware of that. We need to be welcoming with them. We need to seek to build that person up as well. Now how we build them up that may look like two different things for two different people. But the gospel calls the church to receive one another, see, receive those that have committed themselves to serving God and are doing the best in that service, even in the midst of failings. And so we need to understand the church is a hospital for the sick and we need to expect to deal with sin, to deal with sin. So let us receive sinners. Let's also address sin. Let us address sin. This deals with confronting sin as well. The church should be forthright in addressing sin as I mentioned, Ephesians chapter four in verse 15. Rather speaking the truth and love we're to grow up in every way into him who is the head into Christ. Now the verse before that says we're not to be tossed here, and they're tossed to and fro like children on the waves by deceitful schemes, but rather, were to speak the truth in love. I feel like what the world offers the error of the world is that tossing to and fro, the deceitful schemes that we find there, what the gospel offers what God offers is truth. And so we need to speak the truth. And in part that involves addressing sin, calling it out. A spade should be called a spade, and sin should be identified as sin. Addressing sin within the church should involve wisdom and discernment to it's not something that should be taken lightly. We don't go around just blabbing. You see the center call, there's a sin, there's a sin, that that's not going to be the right way to do that. And so it does take wisdom and discernment. As we look through the Scripture, we see that there are ways to address sin, particularly among brothers and sisters. And so understand that many within the me to movement again, it's hard to even speak about that movement. Because it's so broad. One things I get from that is that there are many that felt voiceless and felt helpless. And so we need we need to hear that.

Jeremy Sweets  24:16
But if I were to suggest some to someone about how to deal with this, I'm not sure throwing out an accusation into the internet is going to be the most profitable way to deal with that. So that's not what I'm suggesting. Notice if you would in Matthew chapter 18. Matthew chapter 18, and verse 15.

Jeremy Sweets  24:44
Here the tech says, If your brother sins against you go and tell him his fault between you and him alone. If he listens to you, you have gained your brother, but if he does not listen, take one or two others along with you that every chance charge may be established by the evidence of two or three weeks. witness's fear refuses to listen to them, tell it to the church. And if he refuses to listen even to the church, let him be to you as a Gentile, and a tax collector. Here, we see that the process for dealing with sin between brothers and sisters in Christ is to the best of your ability, go to that person, talk to them, tell them about the situation. Now, sadly, many of the sins that occur in this type of sexual assault is where there's a strong power differential where someone has authority or power over someone else. And so it's very difficult to do this. And so I would say to the best of your ability, talk to that person, address that sin. If that does not work, you're unable to do that convince the person the text says, you can take other steps, including take others with you. So that the listen to the voice of two or three. That does not work, it should be told to the church. If they don't listen to the church, then they should be treated as a gentile or a tax collector basically as one that is not a Christian. And so we see here this process that Jesus gives for, for in general, dealing with faults and sins that occur between people. We also say that I talked this morning about being careful of or realizing that this could even happen to leaders, to elders, to preachers, to those that are in a position of authority, we need to be careful about that. But if we're to bring an accusation against an elder that all shows also should be done carefully, not flippantly. It should be done with respect. In First Timothy chapter five verses 19 through 22. says do not admit a charge against an elder except on the evidence of two or three witnesses. As for those who persist in sin, rebuke them in the presence of all so that the rest may stand in fear. In the presence of God and of Christ Jesus and of the elect angels, I charge you to keep these rules without pre judging, doing nothing from partiality. Do not be hasty in the laying on of hands nor take part in the sins of others keep yourself pure. Now here here, it says that if you're to bring a charge against an elder, remember, elders were chosen by the congregation as those that were above reproach, they have a track record of doing what is good and beneficial. And so it should be taken very carefully. Again, not flippantly. But I'll also say that elders are not above sin. It's possible and it's happened in many congregations that elders get caught up in many different kinds of sin. But here the text says, take one or two with you. And I don't know if he's changing to an ageneral statement here are still continuing with elders but he says as those who persistence and rebuked them in the presence of all so that the rest of my stand in fear. He goes on to say, Do not be hasty in the laying on of hands. Do not be hasty and throwing out accusations. Do not be hasty and trying to to deal retribution as if you think you can make things right. Don't be hasty in those things. keep yourself pure. The tech says, as we address sin, when you'll be truthful and forthright about it. But as we're dealing with sins, particularly within the body, there are processes in place that the scripture points to that will help us address those things. Again, not not taking those things lightly, but also not ignoring them. Some people feel like if they want the church to be at peace, that means ignoring sin, and that's, that's not what God wants from us. We're not to ignore sin or just act like it didn't happen or I just need to get over it. Sin needs to be addressed. It needs to be addressed. We see in James chapter five and verse 16.

Jeremy Sweets  29:17
That sin should not just happen when someone comes to us and points out our sin. But we also need to be proactive in confessing our sins. We don't need to make someone come to us if we've done wrong, we can acknowledge that and pray together. Ask for forgiveness. Therefore, confess your sins to one another and pray for one another that you may be healed. The prayer of a righteous person has great power as it is working in James chapter five, verse 16. Jesus also mentioned the importance of being at peace with your brother. It says if you have your offering and you realize you have some something against your brother or your brother has something against you. He says, Leave your offering, and go tend to your brother, make sure that there is peace there that things are as they should be. Again, I'll mention, because of the difficulty of the situation that can arise because of this particular sin, you may need the advice of the elders, wise Christians, others, you may need to reach out, this is a difficult subject, I'm not trying to smooth this over in three easy steps, we'll get it all fixed. That is not the point. And so as we think about sin, we need to understand that the church is filled with those that were sinners. And it may be that there would still be sin committed among them, we need to be ready to receive both centers and those oppressed by sin, thinking about what is best for them and helping them where we can. And we need to be a group that continues to address sin, both by speaking publicly about it from the pulpit, but also in helping one another. And dealing with those things and putting sin behind us. Remember, we're all trying to get to the same place, aren't we? We're all trying to get to heaven. That is the goal. We don't want anyone left behind. We all want to get there. So let us work with that in mind, let us work with that in mind. It may be that this is a secret sin that you've kept covered. Because this is something that you don't want anyone else to know. God knows, God knows. And I'm not saying you have to get up and tell every single person. But it would do good to confess that sin to begin to address it. When it's hidden sin festers, the guilt continues, the shame carries on. But when sin has confessed, it is a place where you can begin to deal with it begin to address it. Let me also suggest that Christ suffered oppression at the hands of sinners. We've been on both sides of that equation, haven't we? We have been the perpetrators of sin. It is our sins that put Jesus on the cross. It is our sins that nailed Him to the cross. And so we need to be thankful for what Jesus has done for us. And as we think about how we deal with other people that are sinners, let us reach out with kindness, compassion, and grace, as much as possible. Jesus was oppressed by sinners. And it may be that we have felt oppressed by sin and by others, maybe it's by something that's a no fault of our own. Well, we need to look to Jesus Christ, who endured and left us an example of one that persisted and doing what was right and trusting himself to God as it says in First Peter chapter two, verses 21 through 25, let us look at all of this to Jesus Christ, who is our shining lights, our great example, our deliverer, the one that we should imitate and entrust ourselves to Jesus Christ and Almighty God. Maybe there's someone here tonight that is not a Christian, you've not obeyed the gospel message. You need to believe the gospel believe the good news that Jesus is the Christ that calls you to repent and change your lifestyle for a way from sin, and the service to God, confessing that Jesus is the Christ and being baptized in the water for forgiveness of your sins. When you do that you put to death the old man and you're raised to walk in newness of life. Maybe you're here tonight and you are a Christian, but you're not living as you should. There's no better time to make your life right than right now. there's anything we can do to help you please come as we stand and sing at this time.
