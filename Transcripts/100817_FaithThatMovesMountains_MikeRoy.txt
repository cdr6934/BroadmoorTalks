It is always such a, an honor and a privilege privilege for us to come and worship our powerful loving Holy God. Of all the things that we could do this morning with all things competing for our time and attention, football and media and travel and everything else. This is the most meaningful activity that we can engage in worshiping God praising Him, and communing with our Savior. In the Lord's Supper, we are here to praise God, it's wonderful to be here. As most of you are, many of you might know many of us went hiking in the Smoky Mountains last weekend. And that's always an enjoyable, relaxing time it is for me, is we, as our spirits are refreshed by God's presence in the mountains. It does require a great deal of exercise, though sometimes there's some huffing and puffing and as we get older, more huffing and more puffing. But it is very refreshing as we witnessed God's creation. In fact, I also suggest to you that it is an exercise in faith building. What faith building is you climb a mountain? Why sure. Did you ever wonder who made that mountain? Yeah, God made that mountain. So being in God's creation, in fact, invigorates our faith. If we witness His power, we smell the flowers, and we feel the wind. And we see the bears up front and up close and personal as I did this past week with my kids and some others on the mountain. But I suggest to you that Jesus is talked a lot about mountains in the gospels, and he talks about the idea of moving mountains and telling them to go into the heart of the sea. And so this morning, where's my clicker here, I want to talk with you about faith that moves mountains. Now, before you completely dismiss that thought, these are Jesus words, we'll be looking at Scripture. And the text that we'll be looking at will actually be several sections of the gospel. But I want to discuss with you the idea that Jesus plainly discussed with his disciples and by extension us as well, the idea that we can develop faith, powerful enough to move mountains. And so let's look at the text. And in we'll just gonna be looking at several passages, making some applications so I don't have three or four or five or six points, and a conventional lesson. But I do want to send a stand that we can develop a faith that will enable us to move mountains. Look at Matthew chapter 21. And we'll get I think most of these on the screen this morning, says when the disciples saw it, they marveled, saying, How did the fig tree whether it once Jesus answered them, Truly I say to you, if you have faith, and do not doubt, you will not only do what has been done to the fig tree, which the Jesus cursed the fig tree and died, but even say to this mountain, be taken up and thrown into the sea, and it will happen. And whatever you ask in prayer you will receive if you have faith. In Mark chapter 11. Another account says that they passed by in the morning they saw the fig tree withered away to his roots. And Peter remembered and said to him, Rabbi, look, the fig tree that you cursed has withered. Jesus answered them, Have faith in God, truly, I say to you, whoever says to this mountain, be taken up and thrown into the heart of the sea, and does not doubt in his heart, but believes that what he says will come to pass, it will be done for him. That's pretty plain language over there. As you look at Mark's account, here in chapter 11.

Mike Roy  03:57
Look at another verse or two with me and Luke chapter 17. Jesus changes the language just a little bit here. And again, the same context, the Apostle said to the Lord, Increase our faith in the Lord said, if you had faith like a grain of mustard seed, you can say to this mulberry tree be uprooted and planted in the sea, and it would obey you again by faith. They could tell this mulberry tree to be uprooted and planted in the sea, and it would obey them one of the verse I want to look at as we get into the lesson, get a parallel accountant and Matthew chapter 17. So again, the disciples were unable to cast the demon out of a boy that was possessed by a demon. They came to Jesus privately said Why can we not drive it out? And he said to them, because of the littleness of your faith, for truly I say to you, if you have faith the size of a mustard seed, you will say to this mountain, move from here to there, and it will move and nothing will be impossible for you. The language is too plain. We can't miss that. But I talked to the challenge this morning, Dan, for us is to develop a faith that moves mountains, there's no question about the language that Jesus used very plainly, he said, If you have faith, even the size of a grain of mustard seed, you can move mountains, you can cast a mulberry tree into the sea. So as we understand what this means, and raise the questions as you really mean, you can actually throw a mountain into the ocean. And that's from the questions that will come to our mind. But the first phrase that we have to focus on what is this, this statement mean? faith the size of a mustard seed? Well, to understand it, look at these, a text that deals with that in Matthew chapter 13, verses 31. And 32 says that Jesus put in put another parable before them saying, The kingdom of heaven is like the grain of mustard seed that a man took and sowed in his field. It is the smallest of all seeds. But when it has grown, it is larger than all the garden plants and becomes a tree so that the birds of the air come and make us nest in his branches. And so when you look at this passage over here, Jesus is telling us and reminds us that a mustard seed was the smallest of all seeds. And so some people raised the question, what does it mean, then if you have faith, like that of a mustard seed, very, very small faith, tiny faith, you can tell this mountain to jump into the sea, is that what he's saying over here? I don't think that's what he's saying. The mustard seed was the smallest of all seeds. But it produced the largest of all the herbs and even became, quote, a tree. So this is a lesson of perspective, the tiniest little bitty mustard seed would explode and expand and grow to the point of producing a very flourishing plant slash tree. So I think the application is Jesus is saying to us, if you have faith, if we have faith, like a mustard seed faith that is ever growing, ever expanding, even exploding, we can overcome mountains of great difficulty. I think that's what he's telling us here. And as Albert Barnes said, it is commentary. He said, concerning the mustard seed, he said, There is a principle of vitality, in the grain of seed stretching forward to great results, which illustrates the nature of faith. Faith only gets stronger if we exercise it. We realize physically that principle as well. And so I think that that's what Albert Barnes is implying here in in the mustard seeds. So again, the question is, can we really move mountains and throw them into the heart of the sea? This is a picture of the Smoky Mountains. This, I think, is on the North Carolina side of the Smokies. But has anybody ever taken that kind of a mountain? Any one of these mountains and threw those into a lake? Had the disciples ever thrown a mountain into the sea physically? I don't believe so. Could you take that mountain? Can you take that mountain and throw it into the ocean? I think so. And here's another one. Is it possible to take a mountain like that and throw it into the ocean? I don't believe that's what this this patch is to say. So you go back to the text and say what does Jesus mean by that? Is the mountain is a visual. It's an object lesson. And he's saying, basically to His disciples, you

Mike Roy  08:52
see this impressive mountain, this massive, majestic, immovable, firm mountain that you cannot move from this location? Do you see that? He's saying that your faith can be even stronger than this mountain? That's impressive. And we say well, wait a minute, my face not like that. But that's what Jesus said, You it you can develop your faith, to the point that it's even stronger in even more immovable than the mountain. Can anybody cause me to go to hell to lose my soul? Nobody can do it. I can give it up myself. But I can act of faith and say, I am determined to do my father's will. And I'm not going to miss out on heaven. Because I'm going to be like a mountain even more powerful, that nobody under any circumstances is going to tell me that you can't make it to heaven. That's the kind of faith that we're talking about over here. So he's saying Jesus is saying that we can develop such a powerful faith to accomplish even the most difficult tasks which at first glance would seem to be impossible. And so, application again, mountains size faith based on the text that we looked at this morning. Mountain size, faith moves, mountains of doubt anybody wrestled with doubt, if we're honest, we do. It moves mountains of worry, mountains of fear, mountains of grief, mountains of despair, mouths of temptation. In mountain size, faith moves, any obstacle you are facing. Do I hear an amen on that? That's right. That's what mountainsides fate does but but we're so intimidated by the devil and in his tactics that we say I could never overcome, overcome anger or lust, or greed, or pride. No, you can. I can we can if we want to, if we will, too. But that's what I'm saying. mountainsides faith overcomes all these things. Did Jesus ever talk about doubt, and worry and fear he constantly did. He told us not to doubt not to worry, not to give into fear and, and time and time again, Jesus turns to creation. And he says to His disciples, Look at the lilies of the field, Look at the birds of the air. He said, God provides for them if God provides for the sparrow, which is insignificant, he will provide for you and for me, if God clothes the flowers of the field, which are alive today, and tomorrow cast into the oven, he will put clothes on your back. But we often don't believe it. Our faith isn't what it should be. And so again, concerning feared, Jesus said, in essence, don't fear man, but fear dot, the most important fear we should develop is a fear of God. And if we would learn to fear God, above all people, we wouldn't fear anybody. But I look at people that are impressive or successful, or whatever intimidating, often I feel inadequate, or that may be threatened. Don't ever say a preacher on that subject. Really, who gave you the authority to forbid me from preaching on any particular subject? God authorizes us to preach His Word. But as human beings, we get overwhelmed by temptation, overwhelmed by fear, overwhelmed by worry. Remember, what about Jesus did it? Did Jesus ever struggle with temptation? I talked about this? I can't remember a few months ago. But in the Yes, he did struggle with temptation. Matthew chapter for Luke chapter four, he overcame all the temptations of the devil. And in particular, we focus this morning on Jesus in the garden of Gethsemane, what was going on there? Satan is trying to push Jesus to the breaking point. He's trying to push Jesus to the point of despair. And Jesus would not be broken. That's, that's one of the lessons that that God is telling us in Scripture. So do you ever face a mountain of temptation? Do you ever face a mountain of grief, anguish, suffering, we

Mike Roy  13:11
all do, every single one of us do, and we can feel almost overwhelmed like these mountains can't be moved. We're familiar with Jeremy and Lauren struggles in anguish and seeking to adopt and having a disappointment near the end there. And so we know from their experience of the anguish and the agony that they wrestled with, I would suggest to you that ultimately, it was their faith, that push those mountains, into the sea. And today, we sit here celebrating the adopted child that they have Lucas, Keith McNatt, because they acted on faith and they reached out. And what seemed like an impossibility became possible in real. So but the point is, God still moves mountains today, mountains of doubt, and fear and worrying inadequacy. And the reality is, Jesus is telling us that we can move those mountains. Isn't that what he said? If you have faith is the size of a mustard seed. He's really saying if you if you have faith, like a mustard seed, which is growing and expanding, you can overcome anything. I think that's the message that he is telling all of us. And so when you look at scripture, some other scriptures that to verify this truth, in First John chapter five and verse four, John says, for everyone who has been born of God overcomes the world, what difficulty is there that can pin you down and keep you from doing God's will and keep you from making to heaven? There isn't any. He said, John says for everyone or anyone who has been born of God born again and completely committed their lives to Jesus Christ overcomes not just one mountain or many mountains He overcomes all mountains. Because faith is the victory over these things. So he's saying that everyone who has been born of God overcomes the world. And this is the victory that has overcome the world, our faith, so we can, we can move mountains of doubt and cast them into the sea, can't we, we can move mountains of fear and mountains of temptation that assault us, it seems so intimidating, we can do that, if we choose to. And that's why I say it just a minute ago, we can increase our faith. By reading God's word. We'll talk about that in just a minute. But when you hike on God's mouth, as you sail on his seas, you swim in his rivers, you realize his power is infinite. And that power is available for you. And for me, as we face mountains, have difficulty of trials, temptations, burdens, all that type of thing. And so John tells us, then, in fact, that faith is the victory that allows us to overcome the world. look at another example or two before we bring the lesson to close this morning Revelation chapter to the church at Smyrna, Jesus gives him this message. He said, Do not fear what you're about to suffer, Behold, the devil is about to throw some of you into prison, that you may be tested. And for 10 days you will be you will have tribulation. He said, Be faithful unto death, and I will give you the crown of life. He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches that he says the one who conquers, whoever conquers, will not be hurt by the second death. And so the point I make from this context here, is that these brethren in Smyrna faced a mountain of suffering. And Jesus said, I know your tribulation, I know your poverty, I know the Blasphemy That your enemies are railing against you. I know the fear of suffering, it's one thing to suffer. And suffering can be a difficulty to bear this almost seemingly, almost unbearable, but the fear of suffering can also be crippling. And sometimes the fear of temptation. We know temptation is powerful. Sometimes I'm afraid of having a bad thought, in fear of something can be very, very powerful. Jesus said, Don't fear what you are about to suffer. And so again, the point I'm making here, what was the key to their survival? If he said, Be faithful unto death, be faithful to the point of death, know what the word faithful means in real simplistic terms, full of faith, very often, I'm full of worry, full of doubt, full of anxiety, what he said, the full of faith, to fill your cup full of God's Holy Word,

Mike Roy  18:00
so it will transform you. So the key to their survival bend these Christians with the church in Smyrna was their faith and the key to your survival? Is your faith. The key to my survival is my faith. Brethren, we need to remind ourselves as this passage to tell us that we are conquerors. We are overcomers as Christians, and yes, we are mountain movers. That's what Jesus is saying, isn't it? You're not saying physically throw them out. And and for us, that's not even possible. But whatever the the the mountain size, difficulty that you are facing in your life, you can cast it into the sea, with the help of others through prayer, that type of thing. So the question that we would maybe raise is this question How, excuse me, how then do we get more faith? That's a natural question. We all want to have more faith, don't we? How do we get more faith? Well, the pastor that comes to mind in Romans chapter 10, Paul elaborates on this when he talks about the the nature of faith and it comes through preaching and hearing God's word. And in verse 14, he said, How then will they call on him in whom they have not believed? And how are they to believe in him of whom they have never heard? And how are they to hear without someone preaching? And how are they to preach unless they are sent as it is written? How beautiful are the feet of those who preach the good news, but they have not all obeyed the gospel? For Isaiah says, Lord who has believed what we have heard from what he has heard from us. So in verse 17, faith comes from hearing and hearing through the word of Christ. So this passage reminds us of a plain Bible teaching that faith comes by hearing, listening to and following the Word of God. And so if you want to increase our faith, listen to God's word more read God's more word, more often. That's we've stress here and broaden with the need to be on a Bible reading plan. I'm not perfectly and carrying that out. But that's my, that's my effort to read God's word, if I can a little bit every day, and one thing that I've done is I've gotten older, and with Bible apps and iPads and all that type of thing, I listened to God's word, and listen to it in a version that you're not familiar with it all centered, just kind of jumps out off the page and comes alive. Listen to the living Word of God. And when in doing so, we can gain greater faith. So faith does come in one way by reading and listening and studying God's word coming together to worship God is so important, this also increases our faith. But I mentioned just a minute ago, you want to increase your faith. Go to the mountains, go to the seven seas go to the Pacific go and God's creation, because these things inspire faith, we stand at the bottom of the mountain, we say, Wow. Who could have ever made this? And there's only one answer. God made the mountains. He made it for you, to witness His power, His love his creation, and for us to be impressed by his power. So when we look at God's creation, were awestruck by someone who did all of that for you and me to enjoy his creation. Most of you, I trust that some of you may have you witnessed the recent Total Eclipse of the Suns something else see that

Mike Roy  21:37
people came from all over the world. We were at Cracker Barrel Sunday night before it happened, people from Japan, Great Britain, of Australia, and this thing came over my backyard. Wow. But we looked at this thing, we get those glasses, I kind of took time off from work, and I cleared with the boss and everything. And I looked at that. And it was so impressive. And we kept watching the partial eclipse. And finally, when we saw the moon move in front of the sun, it was a total eclipse. It was a breathtaking moment for everyone. And at that moment I took my phone I texted my children say no, there's no scientist. There's no biologist is nobody the brightest person on earth who can do this. The only person who can do this is God in heaven. He's the only one. And he does that. So he helped us and cause us to quit looking down at our feet in our trouble, troubles and trials and look up at him. And so yes, we faith is increased as we study His Word. But when you go about God's creation, were reminded of his power, and all the things that that display his greatness for each of us. And so as we've looked at this Texas morning and the Gospels, Jesus teaches us that by our faith in Him, in in developing faith, like a mustard seed, which may be small at first, but grows and expands. That we can we can move mountains of great difficulty, the challenges for us is to develop that faith into do us a song that we're going to sing in just a moment. develop faith, to realize that faith is the victory that overcomes the world if you want to enjoy God's blessings and forgiveness on all that it begins by faith trusting him knowing that his will is perfect, believing that Jesus is the Messiah, being willing to repent of our sins, confess our faith in him and then submitting to his command to be baptized. If you hear this morning and need to respond to the invitation. We invite you to come while we stand and sing this invitation song
