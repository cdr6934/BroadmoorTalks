Good morning. It's good to see everyone here today, it's good that we have an opportunity to be able to come here and worship, it's always a refreshing thing to be able to worship our gods. I appreciate the fact that you're, you're here to worship. With us. We have many guests that are here, we have a few pockets from people being out. I know that we were out last week on vacation, I think we were joined by a couple of other families that go into different locations on vacation, but it's good to be back here. With you. There was a lot that happened last week, we got the texts and different things from surgeries to burst the passing of Dave's father and so a lot to be mindful of a lot to be prayerful of.

A lynch pin is a pin that's placed at the end of the axle that will keep the wheel in place. And so it's really not that big of an item. It's like a stick and you simply stick it in the end of that axle, and it keeps the wheel in place. The problem is if you remove that, or if it gets damaged and falls off or something like that the whole cart or whatever it is, it's going there, the wheel is going to fall off. And so it's an extremely important part of, of the wheel of the cart. The resurrection is the linchpin of our faith. I think Paul makes this point very clear in First Corinthians chapter 15. It is that P so that element of our faith that if it goes away, if it falls away, then our entire faith falls with it. But if it's firmly in place, like I believe that it is then our our faith is firmly in place as well. Paul is going to make this argument in First Corinthians chapter 15. First Corinthians 15. And notice what he says in verse 12. He says, Now if Christ is proclaimed as raised from the dead, how can some of you say that there is no resurrection from the dead? Notice verse 14, he says, And if Christ has not been raised, then our preaching is in vain, and your faith is in vain. And again, in verse 17, and if Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile and you are still in your sins, then those who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished. If in Christ, we have hope, in this life only, we are of all people most to be pitied. But in fact, Christ has been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep. Here we see that Paul says that the resurrection of Jesus Christ is the linchpin of our faith. And he goes through different scenarios, what falls apart what falls off without the linchpin of the resurrection? Well, he says that our preaching is in vain. He says, Your faith is futile. Those that have fallen asleep have perished. Our faith is in vain if the resurrection has not taken place. But if the resurrection is a fact, as he asserts in verse 20, I believe that it provides solid foundation for for our faith, and for our activity and preaching the gospel. I went to Millersville, to preach, they had Wednesday night lessons, and they were having a theme on spiritual family unity. And so there are a series of topics looked at Unity, and they had different topics that address that. So I spoke on the resurrection, the resurrection, so I'm going to give you the benefit of what I gave them on that Wednesday, nine. So we'll be looking at United in the resurrection. I hope you appreciate the fact as well, my point raised, all my points are going to raise as we look at this, all right, united in the resurrection. So how are we united in the resurrection? Well, their goal was to look at spiritual family or unity within the church. But my first point actually goes beyond that. And this is something we have unity with all people of all faiths, of all practices. On this point, we are united with all others, whether they are atheists, Buddhists, Muslims or Jews. And that is the truth that we live in a world that is united in the fact of the resurrection, the fact of the Resurrection. The Resurrection is a historical fact. It is something that occurred and that's what we see in First Corinthians chapter 15, in verse 23, says, but in fact, Christ has been raised from the dead, the firstfruits of those who have fallen asleep? We see that this. This fact is established by eyewitness testimony. Just as we might establish facts today in a

Jeremy Sweets  05:13
court type system, we see that eyewitness testimony tells us about the fact of the resurrection. In Acts chapter 10, and verse 39. It says they put him to death by hanging Him on a tree. But God raised him on the third day and made him to appear not to all the people, but to us, who have been chosen by God as witnesses who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead. There are others that witness Jesus Christ after he was raised from the dead. And so we see that is this eyewitness testimony that provides a foundation for the resurrection and in turn, are very faith. So notice a few things. Before I get there, notice. There's a man named Jay Warner Wallace. And he was a homicide detective. And so in his career, he was often dealing with people that lied about what they had done. So as he went about and tried to solve crimes, he noticed that a lot of people lied what they done, and a lot of people tried to collude together to lie about what they had done if there are more than one person involved. And notice what he says about a successful conspiracy. That means two or more people get together in order to lie about what has happened. So what does it take to have a successful conspiracy, in his number of years, he determined that it needed to be a small number of conspirators, it also needed to be a short timespan from when the event happened to when they were being interviewed. If it were to be successful, they needed to have thorough and immediate communication. If you're going to lie, you do need to be able to lie together. And so they would have to communicate together. They're also involved significant relational connections. And so there had to be some kind of relationship, a strong relationship if it were to be a successful conspiracy or lying about what had happened. And there also needed to be little or no pressure placed upon them. What's interesting, if we go through that list of what requires what is needed for a successful conspiracy, all those items are missing when it comes to the resurrection. And so that's what I want to look at for just a few moments, some of this evidence of eyewitness testimony.

Jeremy Sweets  07:40
Mr. Wallace says there needs to be a small number of conspirators to have a successful conspiracy. Well notice when we're talking about the resurrection, that there are many witnesses that are involved. In first Corinthians 15 And verse six, Paul states that Christ appeared to over 500 people at one time, and he says most of whom are still alive and can be questioned. So at the time of Paul's writings, many of those people were aligned. So we asked the question, was the resurrection a conspiracy? Was it a lie that was told? Well, we see he violates one of these rules, there were a large number of people that witness this, and they could be questioned about whether that happened or not. And so the first criteria falls there for a successful conspiracy. Secondly, he states it, you need to have a short time span between the the events and the interviews that took place. But notice that the witnesses that went about preaching the gospel, this took place over many years, Paul wrote First Corinthians around 57, or 58, some 25 years after the crucifixion, he said that were still some around who could be questioned. He also said that the first or we also see that the first gospel was probably written around 30 to 35 years after the resurrection. It had been much harder for over 500 people to lie about something that occurred that many years after the resurrection. So there were many witnesses that occurred over many years. Next, we see that Mr. Wallace says that you need to have thorough and immediate communication. You need to be able to communicate with one another. But is that what happened in the first century? No, but weather received that they were over a broad geography. These were people that were in Jerusalem for the day of Pentecost, and it was filled with men from every nation. But what did they do afterwards? They went out, they went out and they went back home, and there was over abroad Gee, geography. Now, do you think they had a private text message group? Did they have some ability to be able to communicate and coordinate some type of lie about the resurrection? No, that was not the case. Instead, we see that occurred over abroad geography. Furthermore, we'd see that Mr. Wallace says you need to have significant relational connections. If you're going to lie together and collude together. And there needs to be some kind of relationship. They're giving you some reason to, to go at this to lie together. But notice, when we look at the resurrection, it was not only the friends and those that were close together that made this statement of the resurrection. But it was even the enemies. Even the enemies of Jesus could not contradict the empty tomb. They even hired guards to lie, and they had access to the empty tomb, yet they could never refute the testimony of the witnesses. Matthew 28, verses 12. And 13 says, And when they assembled with the elders and taken counsel, they gave us a sufficient sum of money to the soldiers and said, tell people, his disciples came by night and stole him away while we were asleep. Now imagine this scenario. Some people wake up, and they notice that their house has been ransacked. They see the evidence of what has happened. And so they call the police and they say, Did you see who did this? They say, No, we were asleep. Do you think the police are going to call them in and put them in front of a lineup to be able to identify who ransack their house? No, because they just said they were asleep. So how could they identify who had done the ransacking? And so it is here with the resurrection? How could they when they were asleep, identify who had taken the body? Well, we don't even have to go down that path. Because clearly it says they were hired to do this, and this was a law. This was not the truth. The truth instead was that Jesus had raised from the dead.

Jeremy Sweets  12:13
The last point of the Mr. Wallace's successful conspiracy, is that there needs to be little or no pressure. And this is why the the police or detectives will often try to apply pressure about the consequences of their action, whether it be criminal charges would be brought or something along those lines, they try to apply pressure. And often people that are lying when the pressure comes, they will break, they will change their story and begin to tell the truth instead. But notice here that there was significant pressure upon the apostles and eyewitnesses to change their story. The apostles proclaim the resurrection, even though they were beaten, persecuted and put to death. They suffered a loss of money, not a gain, and they spent their days trying to convince others of this truth. What could the apostles have possibly have gained from lying about the resurrection? What was their benefit? Or what was to be to their benefits? Was it money? Fame, comfort? No, it was none of those things. In fact, they had to give up everything in order to speak to this truth, as Paul says, they're preaching lives and faith would have been in vain, if not for the fact of the resurrection. And so this is a point I want us to understand that we are united with all people in the fact of the resurrection. And as Christians, we are simply trying to preach and proclaim and tell others about it. Well, how else are we united in the resurrection? Well, this applies more to Christians Millersville, this church, Christians all over the land, we are united in the new life of the resurrection, the resurrection occurred, and it gives us new life. In John 1125. Jesus said, I am the resurrection, and the life is a resurrection in life go together. Resurrection is to be raised from the dead it is to have life and to give life. And we as Christians are raised to new life in baptism. In Romans six verses three and four, says we were buried therefore with him by baptism into death, in order that just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, so we too might walk in newness of life. We all share in this significance found in baptism. As Christians we have had our sins washed away. As Christians we have made the same commitment to serve God. As Christians, we are striving to put away that man of, of sin, that old man, and we are all striving to live a new life, a life according to the resurrection, newness of life. So we're united in the resurrection as those that practice it. This new life also means a new way of living a new way of living. And Ephesians four, Paul describes this as the old man and the new man, that old man we are putting to death. He's not to guide us. He is not to be the one that we follow after the man after sin, but we're gonna have a new man. Notice what he says in Ephesians four and verse 22. He says, to put off your old self, which belongs to your former manner of life, and is corrupt through deceitful desires, and to be renewed in the spirit of your minds, and to put on the new self created after the likeness of God and true righteousness and holiness. And so what you're going to see for Christians as they live into this new life, this new way of living, there's going to be a process that's involved, there's going to be several different items. It's brought up in Ephesians, four, but I think also in Colossians, and we're going to look at Colossians, we see this new life described in clause in chapter two Colossians chapter two, in verses 11 and 12. Notice what it says there.

Jeremy Sweets  16:38
In Him, you also were circumcised with a circumcision made without hands, by putting off the body of flesh by the circumcision of Christ, having been buried with him in baptism, and once you were also raised with Him through faith in the powerful working of God, who raised him from the dead. Notice that you get your new starts in baptism, that is when you are raised with Christ. That's our theme this year, isn't it being raised with Christ? Well, as you continue on in Colossians, you're going to see that being raised with Christ, and baptism has other implications or other things that go along with it. It also involves a new mindset, a new commitment of your mind and what you're devoted to, in Colossians, three, in verses one and two, notice what it says, if then you have been raised with Christ, seek the things that are above where Christ is seated at the right hand of God sets your mind on things that are above, not on things that are on the earth. Here we see that we are to focus or to set or establish our mind upon the things above, not on the things of the earth. That new mindset is to be put into action as well. Notice what he says in Colossians three and verse five. He says that you're to put to death therefore what is earthly in you, and he's going to describe these things in verses five through 11. But these things to death, for example, in verse five, put to death therefore what is earthly in you sexual immorality, impurity, passion, evil desire, covetousness, which is I Dollar Tree, and he goes on to describe other things that you are to put away, where to put away sin and sinfulness. And Colossians three and verse 12, through 17, he's gonna say, then you're to put on certain things, you're to put off certain things you're to put on, in verse 12. Notice what he says, Put on then as God's Chosen Ones, holy and beloved, compassionate hearts, kindness, humility, meekness and patience, bearing with one another. And if one has a complaint against another, forgiving each other, as the Lord has forgiven you, so also you must forgive. And above all, these put on love, which binds everything together, in perfect harmony. You see, Christians are those that make a common commitment by being baptized. And when they do that they put to death, The Old Man and the raise to walk in newness of life having their sins washed away. That's not the end of the process. But the beginning, as they devote their minds set their mind on the thing above, they begin to put off and continue to put off sin and the things of sin, and they begin to put on all of their lives, the things of God, the qualities of God. And so we see this new life of the resurrection. It involves how we live, doesn't it and we're united in that we should be in the new life of the resurrection. I want you to notice we're also united in the proclamation of the resurrection. We are all together in the preaching of that fundamental truth. It is our linchpin as well. It is what holds our faith together, even these 2000 years later. Notice that Paul says in first Corinthians chapter 15, in verse one,

Jeremy Sweets  20:20
we see that the resurrection is his foundation in his preaching. First Corinthians 15, verse one. Now I would remind you, brothers of the gospel I preached to you, which you received in which you stand, and why once you are being saved, if you hold fast the word I preached to you, unless you believed in vain, For I delivered to you as a first importance, what I also received, that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the scripture, that He was buried, that he was raised on the third day in accordance with the Scriptures, and that he appeared. And he goes on to talk about those appearances, we often emphasize, or at least I have, often emphasizes, emphasize that the death burial and resurrection is of primary or first importance. But notice, those first couple of verses what we see, that was Paul's message, that was what he preached continually to others. And so it was a first importance. And so we see it goes hand in hand with his preaching, he's going to preach what is of first importance, I want you to notice as well that the resurrection was the foundation of the preaching in the book of Acts. If you go through the book of Acts, which we are doing this quarter, and next couple of quarters, and you notice the preaching or the sermons that are recorded there, in almost every occasion, the resurrection is the foundation of the sermon or the message that is given there. And Acts two, I'm going to run through several of these you may not have time to look all these up. In Acts 223 and 24. This Jesus delivered up according to the definite plan and foreknowledge of God, you crucified and killed by the hands of lawless men. God raised Him up, loosing the pangs of death, and x three and verse 15, he says, And you killed the author of life, whom God raised from the dead. And acts four and verse 10. Let it be known to all of you and to all the people of Israel, that by the name of Jesus Christ of Nazareth, whom you crucified, whom God raised from the dead, do you see a theme here? The resurrection was foundational to their preaching, and acts 10 Verse 39, and 40. They put him to death by hanging Him on a tree. But God raised him on the third day, and made him to appear. And acts 13, verse 28, through 30, and though they found him in him, no guilt worthy of death, they asked Pilate to have Him executed. And when they carried out all that was written of him, they took him down from the tree and laid him in a tomb. But God raised Him from the dead. And act 17, verses two and three. And Paul went in and as was his custom on three days, Sabbath days, he reasoned with them from the scriptures, explaining and providing that it was necessary for the Christ to suffer, and to rise from the dead, and saying, this Jesus, who I'm proclaim to you is the Christ. In Acts 25, and verse 19. Were other they had certain points of dispute with him about their own religion and about certain Jews, Jesus, who was dead, but whom Paul asserted to be alive, he had been resurrected. And acts 26, verses 22 and 23. To this day, I've had the help that comes from God. And so I stand here testifying both too small and great, saying nothing but what the prophets and Moses said, would come to pass, that the Christ must suffer, and that by being the first to rise from the dead, he would proclaim light both to the people and to the Gentiles. So I ran through those pretty quick, but I hope you see the the theme there in the preaching of x. The resurrection is the linchpin, and that is what Paul and the other apostles proclaimed, that is what they spoke. Today, we have the greatest gift in the world to offer people and it's not recreation. It's not an alleviation of poverty. It's not a social system. The greatest gift we have to offer people is new life, new life that is found in the Resurrection. The Resurrection needs to be the foundation of our preaching today as well. It needs to be the message that we spread to others, it is what makes Christianity unique. And it is what holds Christianity together. It is the linchpin. And so it should be the foundation of our preaching.

Jeremy Sweets  25:15
One other point I'd like to discuss, and that is that the, that we are united in the hope of the resurrection, the hope of the resurrection. We are raised to walk in new life now. But we are also looking forward to an aspect of the resurrection. And we do that with all Christians. In first Corinthians 15, and verse 2324. There says, but in fact, Christ has been raised from the dead, the first fruits of those who have fallen asleep. First, by a man came death by a man has also come the resurrection from the dead, for isn't Adam all die, so also in Christ shall all be made alive, but each in his own order, Christ the first fruits, then it is coming those who belong to Christ, then comes the end when He delivers the kingdom to God, the Father after destroying every role, and every authority and power. Notice that the first fruits were celebrated on the Sunday after the Sabbath of the Feast of Unleavened Bread, that was a seven day feast. And so it was variable fixed upon the the day of the month, the week was variable. But within that there would be a Sunday, and on that Sunday, they offered the first fruits of their harvest. So what did that involve? Well, it's exactly what it says the very first produce the first fruit of the ground, they would give to God. Now why would you give someone else or give to God, the first fruits? Well, they did that thanking God for what he had done, but also recognizing that that was a, an indication or a promise of more to come. It was showing their faith and trust in God, and that when he provided the first, he would also provide more. The resurrection is

Jeremy Sweets  27:13
the place where we see that Christ is our first fruits, Christ was raised. But that is a promise of more resurrection. Christ is our first fruits, knowing that he raised from the dead, helps us to believe firmly that we also will be raised from the dead, we also will have eternal life with God if we seek after him. And so we see this promise, this hope, of the resurrection. And that's something we all share as Christians, that's something that unites us and brings us together. In first Peter one, verses three through five, he talks about the living hope of the resurrection. Again, we noticed that the resurrection happened 2020 100 years ago, but it still provides a living hope for us. A hope that has not died away. A hope that is not, is not old, it's not outdated. It's not faded. It is constant and living today, in first Peter one in verse three, he says, Bless it be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, according to His great mercy has caused us to be born again to a living hope, through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, to an inheritance that is imperishable, undefiled and unfading kept in heaven for you, who by God's power are being guarded through faith for a salvation ready to be revealed. In the last time. We have a living hope, as Christians. And we all share that together. The world talks a lot about Christians and their divisions, and there are divisions among Christians that happened in the first century, Paul warned against divisions. But the resurrection is something I hope we can see unites us and brings us together. It's something that should order our life, our new life as we live here, it should order and direct our preaching. And it should bring us together in our common hope together. We're all striving to go to Heaven, to be with God one day. And so we have that common goal together and we can help each other get there. Jesus stated that he is the resurrection and the life. If you are outside of Christ, you don't have access to that life that He promised. It is found in Jesus Christ. And so if you're not a Christian disciple or follower of Christ, you have an opportunity to be one today, believing that Jesus is the Christ repenting of your sins and that life of of sin and selfishness that You followed, confessing that Jesus is the Christ and being baptized in the water for forgiveness of sins. When you do that you put to death the old man, you're raised to walk in newness of life, and then you continue honoring that commitment. So it may be that you're a Christian here today and you're not honoring that commitment as you should. You also have an opportunity to make your life right. There's any subject to the invitation, please come as we stand in saying at this time
