I just wanna remind each of us that the most important thing that we can possibly do on Sunday is to come and worship and praise our awesome God in heaven, to be reminded of everything that he has done for us, and to consecrate our lives to live holy lives. In his side, what a wonderful blessing it always is. To come together to worship God to give him the praise that is do his holy name. We've been doing that this morning. It's also such a delight as we did this morning, together around the Lord's table to remember the greatest sacrifice ever made on our behalf. Thank you, Jacob, for directing our minds with that focus, as we come together as a body of Christ, remember Jesus, into give back to him in terms of our praise or worship are giving as we've done this morning. And so sometimes I say, through a period of Bible study, and worship and the Lord's Supper, that's all we did today that we have, we have honored God and glorified God. In the end, I have a message I want to share with you this morning that I think can be life transforming life changing. God has given us His truth in such a way that he wants us to think about it. He wants us to contemplate it. He wants us to meditate on His Word. And obviously, he receives the praise for that, but he is changing us. He changes us through that process of meditation. I want you to think for a minute, we oftentimes are involved in have birthday party parties get togethers. And that's a wonderful thing. Sometimes somebody prepares a surprise party for you. So how do you feel and once you realize that someone has been planning this great big event in your honor, you think and then you start thinking about all the work that was involved in that all the money spent all the people who traveled to get there, all the effort that was invested in a way that would bring you great joy and great delight, we obviously deeply appreciate that type of thing. We when we realize that somebody, whether it's a husband or wife, or whoever it may be son or daughter has spent so much time and energy, preparing something that's going to give you great delight. When we look in Scripture, the Bible reveals that God has been planning for our forgiveness and for our eventual glory for a long time. It's called a mystery in Scripture, which has been hidden for ages now in the Bible talks about this mystery that's been hidden for ages to come. It's not using the word like we use mystery to be something of something that's mysterious, or something that may be complicated, or something that is difficult to understand. Rather, when God talks about the mystery, hidden for ages to come from, for all ages, he's talking about something that has been hidden from from view. So this morning, I want us to be thinking about this passage in First Corinthians chapter two, verses seven through nine. So my lesson is titled God's hidden plan for our glory. You know, there are some scriptures that challenge us with what I'm calling some really high and exalted thoughts. This scripture is one of those scriptures. So we'll be looking at that on the screen, you might turn to that and your Bible, but God has wants us to think about some truths that are so powerful, so liberating, so glorifying, that it changes who we are and how we serve Him in our lives. And so first Corinthians chapter two, is one of those passages this is actually less than I had been thinking about for quite a while. And I think Jeremy made a comment about less than the priest last week, he had been thinking about it for a year that happens in preaching, you get started on it, not happy with it, put it down to come back to it again. And this was one of those lessons I've been thinking about for quite a long time. And so I want to share with you this message, which basically just declares God's hidden plan, which is for our, our glory. So Look with me in First Corinthians chapter two. And just to get the context over here, and in the first five verses of this chapter, Paul is basically describing his reliance upon God's Spirit as opposed to relying upon his own strength. He said, When I came to you, brethren, I did not come with superiority of speech or of wisdom, proclaiming to you the testimony of God, For I determined to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ and Him crucified. I was with you in weakness and in fear, and in much trembling. my message and my preaching were not in persuasive words of wisdom, but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power, so that your faith would not rest on the wisdom of men, but on the power of God's hope. Paul is talking about the wisdom of God, and in bringing about the plan of salvation, and in his preaching, he didn't rely on human wisdom or any type of speaking skills or human knowledge, but his trust was, was with Almighty God. So I'm gonna look at the the scriptures on the screen here for a moment, as we delve into this passage. And again, this is a lesson not where I have two or three or four points I want to share with you. I just want to mine the scriptures. This is what we call sometimes exegetical preaching, just going to mind the scriptures and say, What is God saying to me? What is the message that comes from these verses? So Paul is going to continue to talk about God's mystery and the wisdom that was behind his scheme of redemption. He says in verse six, yet among the mature, we do impart wisdom, although it is not a wisdom of this age, who are the rulers of this age? So God schemed Redemption was he's really gonna be talking about didn't come about as a result of human wisdom, or any earthly rulers who are doomed to pass away. But in verse seven, he said, we impart a secret and hidden wisdom of God, which God decreed before the ages.

This is something that God has been planning about before all time and it's for our glory. Why would God have a plan to glorify Me? Because of his love, obviously, he said, in verse eight, that none of the None of the rulers of this age understood this, for if they had they would not have crucified the Lord of Glory, but as his written, look at verse nine, I'm going to put this on a different slide. As it is written, what No, I have seen, nor ear heard, nor the heart of man imagined, what God has prepared, some of the surprise party get together, what God has prepared for those who loved him. So that statement is such a compelling statement to me. So Paul saying assets, right? What No, I have seen this. no ear has heard this plan. Even in the heart of men, there's nobody has even imagined what God wants to do for us, his children. And so there's that phrase, what what God has prepared remark reminds us that God has been planning and scheming from all eternity, about a plan to save us from our sins. And incidentally, if we ever struggle with low self esteem, this should be an instant cure of that, for all eternity, God has been thinking about you and thinking about me. That's a remarkable when we contemplate that. And so as you look at this passage, one of the questions we have to think about because these, these are foster challenges at the deepest level of our existence, who was God thinking about? And in preparing this glorious plan for in this verse, it said that God has prepared this for those who love Him. That's you. That's me, if we love God, that's what he's saying over here. God has been thinking about you and me for an awful long time before this world ever was created. God was thinking about a people, you and me who would love Him and serve Him and obey Him. Not only was God thinking about us for a long time, but it reminds us that this was driven by God's everlasting love for us. We'll be looking at in our class on Wednesday with Curtis soon from Jeremiah chapter 31. When God talks about restoring the people of Israel, bringing Judah back to the promised land, and restoring them, he said, I have loved you, with an ever lasting love. I can't get my arms around that brother, friend, but God loves us with an eternal love. You got to stop and think about that. What a compelling thought to think about and so in Jeremiah 31, verse three, so therefore, I have drawn you with loving kindness. So as we think about this, this hidden plan of God from all eternity is driven by this incredible love. Again, the questions we have to ask we sometimes run went past too quickly. How would your life change? If you knew that God loved you so profoundly and loved you eternally? How would your life change? What are the facts your your attitude, Would you worry less? Would you fear less? Would you doubt less? Would you have less anxiety we should, knowing this principle. And so Paul is talking, again, this this past that we're looking at first because he shifted to God's hidden plan because it was hidden from human view from all eternity, but a plan to save us from our sins. But notice, we go into this passage over here, actually, I want to jump over to

Mike Roy  10:29
Colossians chapter one, which is showing us what this mystery was all about. So Paul writes to the Christian to class with the same basic message that we have in the book of Ephesians. The message from Ephesians. And of course, First Corinthians chapter two is very similar. So Paul is talking about this scheme of redemption, this mystery by which God would save us from our sins. He's in verse 25, of which I became a minister according to the stewardship from God, that was given to me to make known the Word of God, to make the Word of God fully known. It says in verse 26, the mystery hidden for ages and generations, but now is revealed to the saints. What drove Paul in his preaching in the first century was the thought of saving people's souls, especially the Gentile. So you sang to these Christians at Colossae, who were Gentile Christians, I believe, so that this mystery has been hidden for ages and generations, but now has been revealed to the saints. To them, God chose to make known how great among the Gentiles. So the Jews are no longer God's chosen people. Now, every single human being can be included in God's eternal Kingdom, everybody. And this is actually what drove Paul to live such a incredible life of service and sacrifice and putting up with pain and torture, in prison, all of that, because the door was opened in the first century, at the fullness of time, Jesus came into the world, God sent His Son to redeem us from our sins, and to and to bring call all people to Himself. So that's what he's talking about over here, said to them, God chose to make known how great among the Gentiles are the riches of the glory of this mystery, which is Christ in you. The hope of glory. So again, these are some phrases over here that we have to think about. And contemplate what Paul is saying over here, makes us go on to I don't forget this in verse 28. It says him we proclaim, warning everyone in teaching everyone with all wisdom, that we may present everyone mature in Christ. So you see that over there. And in verse 28, everyone, everyone, everyone is no longer just the Jews. Everybody can be a part of God's kingdom that includes all of the Gentiles in the first century Roman Empire had access to the eternal kingdom of God could be a part of it. It also means that all of us Gentiles can be a part of God's Kingdom today in Nashville, Tennessee, and all over the world. And so this is what was driving Paul, this hidden mystery, from before eternity has now been revealed to the church or through the church. And that mystery is that Gentiles can now be a part of God's kingdom. And in all of us can share in that that glory. So the phrase over here in verse 27, when he says to them, God chose to make known how great among the Gentiles are the riches of the glory of this mystery, which is Christ in you, that could be translated Christ among you, or Christ. The New Living Translation says that, and this is the secret Christ lives in you. The point is that God's grace, through the preaching of the Gospel, the revealing of this hidden mystery, now is extended to and among all the Gentiles. And that's what get Paul so excited. And so what's the result of that? When he says, which is Christ in you, or Christ among you? What's the what's the result of having Christ in me in you are Christ among us as we're God's people?

Mike Roy  14:29
As he says, over here, the hope of glory, so, with with Christ, now among the Gentiles in giving access to all people, that just gives us a confident hope of eternal glory. In this truth gives each of each of us the assurance of sharing in the eternal glory of Christ. And so when you look at Colossians chapter one, along with First Corinthians Chapter Two, it reminds us that At God has revealed His will in such a way, this hidden plan of salvation that includes all people. And so Paul, the apostle Paul spent his life preaching that message, excited at the prospect of bringing people into God's kingdom, and to share in that glory. And so when you when you think about that, I think we're reminded that this is something that had been kept hidden for a very long time. And then God has chosen to reveal that notice back in our text was gonna go back to First Corinthians chapter two, because the emphasis here is on God's Spirit being the source of revealed truth. It's not coming from any human being. Paul said that these things that God has revealed to us through the Spirit, didn't come through any human being for the Spirit searches everything, even the Depths of God, for who knows a person's thoughts except the spirit of the spirit of that person which is in him. So also, no one comprehends the thoughts of God, except the Spirit of God is. So when you look at this passage in, in First Corinthians chapter two, verses 1011, which is on the heels of the text that we've been building a lesson from this morning, I think Paul is making the point emphatically that this hidden wisdom of God, His glorious plan to save us from His from our sins, to adopt this as his children, even Gentiles, was revealed to humanity by no one else, that and when you look at this, the statement to me that is so compelling in verse nine, I'm looking back at first Corinthians chapter two, when Paul talks about this hidden plan that's been revealed, that things which I has not seen, an ear has not heard. And we have not entered into the heart of man that that this plan that God put in place, is his doing it, nobody had even a clue of how this would come about. In fact, if you look at First Peter, just for a moment, chapter two, Peter talks about, again, the this, this plan of salvation. Okay, I didn't write that one down. But it's basically in verse 10. Similar language that Peter uses over here says, as to the salvation of prophets, who prophesied of the grace that we've come to you made careful searches in inquiry, seeking to know what person or time the Spirit of Christ within them was indicating, as he predicted the sufferings of Christ and the glories to follow, it was revealed to them that they were not serving themselves but you in these things, which now have been announced to you through the through those who preached the gospel to you by the Holy Spirit sent from heaven, things into which angels long to look. So we think about this hidden plan of salvation that we're talking about from First Corinthians chapter to this plan that God had in place before the foundations of the world. And as God began to unfold, that nobody could even understand how this was going to finally come about even the prophets didn't know what all was involved in some of the things that they were predicting about the coming of the Christ, and angels, long to look in this and they didn't know. But in the first century, God revealed this plan. And Paul is one of the chief communicators of that. And that's what again, what got him so excited about sharing the gospel, because everybody can be saved, under God's hidden plan that he has now been revealed. And so again, this reminded though, that this was God's doing. This was not something that any human being has come up with themselves. So very compelling thoughts to think about, we gotta go back. In the few minutes that we have, go back to this text. And look at a key phrase over here. So again, Paul's talking about that this great, hidden plan of God

Mike Roy  19:16
was not brought about by human wisdom, but simply by God's Spirit. And verse seven, he said, but we impart a secret and hidden, hidden wisdom of God, which God decreed before the ages for our glory. We've seen that song this morning glory, yet untold as we're singing that song this morning. It just brings tears to my eyes to think about sharing in the glory of God for all eternity. And this was what God was orchestrating before you and I even came into the world before the world was even created. So this was God's hidden agenda, his hidden plan for you and me. And so when he says that we're imparting this secret this hit The Wisdom of God that he had decreed before the ages for our glory was he talked about I think there's maybe two senses over here. That this is for our glory in the sense that we come into His Glorious Kingdom, forgiven of our sins raised up to sit with Him in the heavenly places right now. That's what Ephesians chapter two talks about. So God was was scheming and forming a plan that was hidden from all humanity from all eternity, that will allow all people, not just the Jews, his chosen people in the Old Testament, all people to come into His kingdom, His glorious kingdom, and to be raised up through faith and repentance and baptism to sit with Him in the heavenly places right now, don't forget that privilege that we have as Christians, right now. We are seated with God with Christ in the heavenly places. And then secondly, when he talks about this as for our glory, it's our ultimate glory. That is, God's scheme of redemption would culminate in our ultimate eternal glory as we sit with Jesus Christ on his throne, Revelation chapter three, verse 20, very compelling thoughts to think about. So when you think about this, and contemplate this, it has to humble each of us as we think about the magnitude of God's love that drove him to formulate this plan. He kept it hidden, from time eternal, if that's how you say that just be beyond even the existence of this world, so that we can be a part of God's kingdom. And one of the things that we need to think about, God has given us imagination. So we talked him back there in First Corinthians chapter two, when when Paul says about this hidden plan for our glory, he said that no eye has seen it, no ear has heard about it. No mind has even fathom it. There's no human heart that even get an get an inkling of what's going to go on, for what God has prepared for them. What that saying is, at least by implication that God has given us an imagination, that he wants us to use it in a good sense, and ultimately, is understanding that God has put this this plan in place that would result in our glory, He wants us to think about the glory of heaven. And that's why God created us ultimately, so that we can share his own glory for all eternity isn't remarkable that you and I is fallen, imperfect, weak, frail, human beings can share God's glory endlessly. That's what drives me want to get my wife, my children, my son in law and sunlight to be and everybody else that comes into the family wanted to get them in heaven for all eternity. And that's what was driving Paul, that that should be driving us. So when we think about this, we should we should begin to visualize this glory that God has given to all of us also, I think it reminds us it gives us a perspective on our suffering, how much suffering did the Apostle Paul go through and preaching the gospel and saving souls and preaching whether it was to do with a Gentile he went through horrific suffering?

Mike Roy  23:27
Or did he? Pol surfing didn't really move him. He wasn't that concerned about? Oh, I'm sure it hurt the insults, the lies the slander, the beatings, being stoned to death. But he knew that when he breathed his last breath, that he'd be with his God for all eternity, in eternal glory. So when we're going through difficulties, sickness, maybe loneliness, hardship, in heart ache, don't want to minimize that. But this truth gives a perspective on your suffering, you're not going to suffer forever. If we're Christians, we obey the will of God and serve Him we can be with Him for all eternity. And so what God has given us these glimpses of what he has put in place for us so that we will learn to overcome our trials, overcome our difficulties, and keep our eyes on the goal of being with him forever. One of the points that I want to make before we extend the invitation, go back to verse 12. of First Corinthians chapter two. So verse 12, says, Now we have received not the spirit of the world, but the Spirit who is from God, so that we may know the things freely given to us by God. He goes on to say which things we also speak not in words taught by human wisdom, but in those taught by the Spirit combining spiritual thoughts with spiritual words. The next few verses talks about the natural man doesn't understand these things. He's not spiritually appraised to do that. But basically, we have the mind of Christ, we know the will of God. And the point that I'm making here is that this, this mystery that was hidden from all eternity is, in fact, understandable. That's just the point where God revealed it at the right time, so that he could bring more people into His kingdom, both Jew and Gentile. So first of all reminds us that, even though for a time, God's hidden mystery was something that was not understandable. We'd people who didn't know what was going on, it has been revealed, and we have an opportunity to be a part of that. So as we bring the lesson to close this one, this is a question. I want us to think about, that God's hidden plan of salvation was designed with you in mind. And with me in mind. So all of this planning that went on from before the creation of the world, this hidden plan, was designed to get you and me into heaven. And I trust this morning that the vast majority of us have obeyed the gospel of Christ, we responded to God's will. But if you're here this morning, and you haven't responded to God's will, why not? You stop and think about that this plan that God put into place before the existence of the world, he did. So with that, we're really with you in mind, with all people in mind. And so that's the question that every human being has to ask themselves, have I responded to God's once hidden, but now reveal plan of salvation? Another question we need to think about in view of God's eternal love that drove him to put together this plan. Can you or will you remain unchanged by God's eternal love for you? Can you remain unchanged by that? If we can know God's love and not respond to it? Nothing else that God can do that we seal our own fate, but if you hear this morning, need to respond to the gospel and becoming a Christian, we'd be glad to assist you with that. If you're ready to express your faith in Christ turned from a life of sin, submit the God's command of baptism, we'll be glad to do that for you this morning to assist you in that or if you just need the President's congregation as you try to keep your eye on the love of God and on the glory that He has prepared for you and if he beats responded Anyway, come while we stand and sing this invitation song
