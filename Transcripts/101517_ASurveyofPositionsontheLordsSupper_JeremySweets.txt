Good morning. Certainly good to see everyone here today, we have a lot to be thankful for. And there's a lot of blessings that we have in our midst. I think fall is the best time of year, we see a lot of good things from the weather. It feels nice, you see the beauty of the trees and the things around about us. It's good to be able to come here and worship, we have the freedom to do that. And we do it regularly. And we almost take that for granted. It's a freedom that we need to be thankful for. I'm thankful to see a girls row up here on the left, I remember when I first came here we had a girls row. So I appreciate our young people taking an interest in God and sitting up front. They've got their notes out ready to take notes, and that's good. There's just a lot of things to be thankful for. One of those is the ability to take the Lord's Supper. And we did that this morning. The Lord's Supper is vitally important. It's a time when we remember Christ's death, which is really the foundational event of all human history and certainly the foundational event for for Christians. That is what we look to. That is what we base our entire lives on. That is the basis of our faith that Jesus Christ died on the cross, and that he rose for us for our sins. And that's the message we we go and proclaim. That is the gospel message. And so it is vitally important. And I think that all Christians agree with that. I believe certainly all Christians here at Broadmoor agree with its importance. In fact, at Broadmoor, we try to focus on the Lord suffer, we take it every week, we try not to make it an afterthought and rush through it, we have a man prepare remarks beforehand. We've even thought about the placement in the service to give a priority and an emphasis upon it. So I think at Broadmoor, we've recognized that the importance of it all of us have recognized that importance. But we also have some differences about the exact applications or some of the details or particulars of the Lord's Supper. And so this morning, I'd like to talk about some of those differences. This sermon may be a little bit different than normal. And we will think about it this way. Normally, I do a lot of study. And I tried to give you my conclusions. This one, and I know this a little bit dangerous, but you're going to be able to peek into my head and kind of see more of my thought process. And so I'm going to try to survey the positions that are out there. And as I think through this subject with you, I'll be looking at the different positions and different ways that that brethren reason about the subject. And so the the goal or the point of this lesson is not necessarily to tell you want I believe, you know, you might even have some kind of dissatisfaction when you open up a commentary. Have you ever gone to a commentary? And there's a difficult passage? And you want to know what the answer is? So you open up this commentary? Tell me the answer. And what the commentary does, it says there's this position in this position in this position in this position, and you're saying, I just want to know the answer. Well, in some ways, I'm going to do the easy part of laying out these positions before you but but the challenge is for all of us. And this is my challenge to you to study these things, to to look to Scripture yourself and to seek to make conclusions on this. So that's going to be one of my main points of emphasis this morning is to encourage our understanding of the way people are reasoning, and to encourage you to study this subject for yourself and also with within the community here. So with that in mind, let us look at a survey of processions on the Lord's Supper. And I may also mention that part of my emphasis will be on the second serving of the Lord's Supper. And so there's many more things that we can talk about even beyond the second serving, but that will impart be some of my focus. I will also mention that I've approached this sermon carefully and prayerfully and I simply ask that you would do the same thing.

Jeremy Sweets  04:36
Okay, so let me just simply look at the passages that are involved in the Lord's Supper. If we were to collect all the passages that referenced the Lord's Supper, we'll start with the Gospel accounts. And we see in Matthew 26, Mark 14 and Luke 22. These are passages we often read before the Lord's Supper as we see that Jesus instituted the Lord's Supper. And I'll not take the time to read through those this morning. But we see parallel passages about Jesus instituting the Lord's Supper before his death. And in the final week of his life, he met with the disciples very intentional, and observed the Lord's Supper instituted the Lord's Supper. I believe that we look to this as an idea of a continuing practice that needs to be understood for the Lord's Supper, but we see the Gospel accounts, and you even see a reference in First Corinthians back to the institution as well. You also have a couple of historical statements of the observance. And you can see this particularly in x two and x two, you see the what we will call the first gospel sermon, the sermon after Jesus had been raised from the dead, and an X 242. There it says, And they were continually devoting themselves to the apostles teaching in the fellowship, to the breaking of bread, and to prayer. And so we see in a mention there of the breaking of bread, which would have been a, a way of referencing the Lord's Supper. As you continue on in that passage, it mentions also another breaking of bread that they did day by day as they enjoyed their meals together with gladness and simplicity of heart. There, I'll quickly mentioned that breaking of bread can be an ambiguous term referring both to the Lord's Supper, but also to a common meal. And so those things should be noted there. And x twinning, we find one of the first passages as that talks about the first day and it seems to indicate a a regular habitual meeting or assembly on the first day of the week, brethren from tro, as met with Paul and his traveling companions, to take to break the bread. And so we see that in Acts chapter 20. There's also a handful of passages that mentioned the Lord's Supper, and often it's, it's used, in a way to address problems. And in First Corinthians chapter 11. In particular, the problem itself is the the observance of the Lord's Supper how they were doing that. And so in First Corinthians five, and 10, the Lord's Supper is used as a point on unity. And even though that's not really the main point of those texts, but it's used as a way of bringing them together and reminding them of something that they shared. And then in First Corinthians chapter 11, we see Paul addressing abuses and misuse there of the Lord's Supper. And so, as I've scanned through scripture, and seen, these are the main passages that address the Lord's Supper, there are some additional analogies that may be able to be making from the Old Testament and, and other things like that. But these are the New Testament references. So in some ways, this is a short list of what we find about the Lord's suffer. But even within this short list, you may think that maybe it was assumed that they were doing this there wasn't a need to discuss this, but I do see a vital importance still on this subject. So those are the passages. Now, I want to talk about the fact that there are different positions on the Lord's Supper. And this is where you may

Jeremy Sweets  08:43
get a little overwhelmed, although that's far from my intention. And so as I thought about what are the different positions that people take on the Lord's Supper, I just started listing these in my mind. And so I'm not going to spend a lot of time on these, but I just want to throw them up kind of on on the board. So when it comes to elements, there are some differences. I think, in general, we would see bread and fruit of the VAR. But even as we discuss that there are some believe that it could be any kind of bread, unleavened, or leavened. There are those that believe it must be unleavened bread. There are those that would believe that it must be grape juice. I've even heard an argument for red grape juice as it signifies the blood of Christ. It can be any fruit of the vine. There are some that say it must be fermented wine. There are some that say it can be multiple cups, some say must be one cup, some say it must be in large quantities, and even some say it must be part of a common meal or should be part of a common meal. So even within the elements, you see differences of belief here. I'm meant to introduce these practices a little bit more and say this, that there's still that point of unity, but these are some of those differences. And in general, these are differences that I've heard among us. So reasoning that I've heard among people that I have worshiped with, and also mentioned as well that some of these are more majority than others. But these positions are taken by sincere, honest, godly men. And so we need to reckon with the fact that honest and sincere people are looking to the Scripture, our common goal is to obey the Scripture, do what God says. But within that there are differences that exist. Okay. So we see that with the elements, we see that with the procedure, if I could turn it that way, there's a need to have the bread first and then the fruit of the vine. Some believe that the prayer must be said before each of the elements some before together, some would say that there must be a physical breaking of the bread. So the server or even maybe the individual that takes it must take the bread and physically break the bread. There's a question about whether it should be offered to all attendees, anyone in attendance without question. And there's also an idea that it must be restricted to Christians or members. And I've even heard within that debate and discussion about whether children should partake, we teach and train our children to give. And so there are some that have even wondered whether children should be trained as they take the Lord's Supper. Okay, so those are some procedural items. Simply another one that I thought about as we think about kind of the focus whether this would be an individual focus or a community is what how we go about observing that, whether it be in times of silence, where we all focus on what is happening, reflect within ourselves. I've also seen other groups that will sing a prayer in a communal activity as they they partake. The purpose, the purpose of the Lord's Supper, there are differences here, there are those that believe that it should be the main purpose of the assembly. Others believe that this this act of worship is vitally important, but not to be elevated above other acts of worship. There are those that believe that we remember the death only, and others would include the death, burial and resurrection. Regarding the time and the frequency, there are those that believe that it must be Sunday, others would follow a Jewish reckoning of the day meaning sundown to sundown, including Saturday night and excluding Sunday night, there were those that would say it could be any day of the week, or those that say it must be a weekly observance, while others say it can be an undefined frequency.

Jeremy Sweets  13:06
There are those that believe that you can only take it one time a week. There are others that believe that it must be taken every time you meet on Sunday. There are those who believe that there should only be one assembly where the Lord suffer is offered one Lord's supper assembly, where others believe that every assembly should be an occasion where the Lord's Supper is is offered, you've probably noticed one of the patterns in here of the words of must and can. There are those that believe within several of these positions that something is binding, it's an unnecessary ingredient. Whereas there are other times where there is a flexibility or an allowance that is made for different options. And so you see that word coming up within these positions. Okay, the setting, there are those that believe that it must be an established church. I've even heard some discussion about with elders or something along that line. It can be an individual outside the assembly, some believe the individual can take it. Some believe a group of Christians maybe a group of traveling Christians can take the Lord's Supper outside, again a regular assembly, there is a question about whether the Lord's Supper can be carried to a home particularly a home of an elderly individual or a hospital or maybe a nursing home can be an individual inside the assembly maybe along the lines of what we have with the second serving where one individual raises their hand and wants to partake. Others would believe that an individual must be joined by at least one other person in order to make a group together of those that would take it and again that may be akin to Sunday night or Offering, there are those that believe that it must be a group that is separated from the main assembly so that all within that group together and maybe in a side classroom, are taking the Lord's suffer. Okay. So these are some ways as I've thought through this and just began to listing the differences that I've heard. And as I tried to talk to as many people as I could, these are some differences that exist on on this point of agreement of a vitally important subject that we all need to study and discuss. Again, I'll say that I've really approached this part of the sermon, particularly with some trepidation. I don't want this to be overwhelming. The last thing I want you to do is throw up your hands and say to them, then we can't know anything we can't. There's no point that that is not what I'm trying to do here. But also think it's not helpful to be simplistic and understanding and think that there is only a single way of doing this. And it's the way that I've heard. That was kind of the way I grew up with many positions. I think that's a part of growing up, as you hear things, this is the only way it's done. And part of that is just a lack of exposure to others. And so maybe in a small way, I'm simply trying to expose you to the different positions that are taken. Okay, that makes sense.

Jeremy Sweets  16:28
Okay, as we look at this, I believe that this is helpful as we even think about the process of interpretation. And so let me just talk a little bit about that. And I think that the Lord's Supper brings this idea of the process of interpretation to the forefront. And that is we we begin with Scripture. And when we begin with scripture, we're looking at the original context, what what it said, then to the original audience from the original author. And so there's lots of things to consider when we think about that, the literary context, how was the point couched in the form, meaning themes that were surrounding a particular point, we look at the paragraphs, we look at the point, when we look at the point of the book, the paragraphs, the sentences, we look at key words. And so we try to do all of this study, as we look at the original context, we consider the original audience, the original readers, sometimes that may be slightly different. If you're talking about a command, maybe within the Gospels, that command may be given to a particular person or, or audience. And so we have to consider those things as well. But also the original readers that would have received the entire work together, we have to consider the first century circumstances. This is particularly important in the letters because the letters were written to address circumstance stances. They were not written as a, you know, you'll get a college textbooks and introduction to psychology or whatever it is, and they're trying to lay out a position or framework or understanding in a systematic way. That's not what we have in Scripture. In general, some people might say Romans approaches that. But in general, I believe we see an idea of the letters, particularly in New Testament being written about circumstances. So we need to try to understand those circumstances. There's also a cultural context, things that were important in the first century are not important. Today, we may scratch our head, in the Old Testament talking about boiling a kid in its mother's milk, what is that even referencing? Or why couldn't they, they mix their garments of different material. We may look at the New Testament and have questions about why would they wash feet that that really doesn't? That's not something we do, right. And so we need to understand why they did things, what was part of their culture. The next step really, is to consider our circumstances today. And so we look at the current culture, we have to analyze and think about our current culture, the circumstances, our needs, our particular needs and abilities. And then we need to do what I call maybe making an application. You know, there's a gap, a 2000 year gap between the New Testament and today, and so we make application bridging that gap. Now, that may seem a little complicated already, let me just say we do a lot of this seamlessly

Jeremy Sweets  19:59
means we We take these things into account, the human mind is pretty amazing how it works, we can take many of these things into account and begin to make applications pretty quickly, particularly if you've practiced and those that have attended church, all their lives have been Christian for a number of years have have trained themselves in this art, this process of making applications and considering these differences. Some of the things that we consider as we bridge this gap, is what in the Scripture is intended to be universal, for example, the Lord's Supper? Is that even something that we should do today? Or is that just something interesting that Jesus told His original disciples? I believe that is intended to be an ongoing practice? I believe that's what Jesus wanted. But we also have to consider cultural elements as well what is intended to be brought forward? What is intended that we would absolutely do that thing, for example, maybe washing feet, is that exactly what we need to do today, there is another way of looking that is timeless versus temporary, are there things that are couched within that culture, that that exact form is not what's important, but rather, and look at the next point, the principal, the principal. And so for example, we may look at the rich young ruler, who was told to go and sell all that he had. And I've heard many lessons on that, and pretty quickly will say, and so we need not hold on to anything, whether it be money or hobby or anything else, we need to be willing to give up everything for, for Christ. And so what we've done there is that we've taken a principle of giving up everything, and we try to make application to giving up anything, we don't often say we must all sell everything that we have. And so as we look at this, we need to consider all of these things. Other things that we might consider within this is what is we use the word of pattern, what is the pattern? And as we consider the universal and cultural principles and concrete, we're going to naturally as we reason about scripture, think about commands, examples and inferences, you can't really get away from that, because that's a standard part of logic. That's simply reasoning together. But it's not enough to merely say that we're going to use those things you have to add to that these, these processes these thoughts, meaning go and sell everything you have. That's a command, isn't it. But we have to consider the original audience the context, whether a principle is needed in that situation, or whether the exact form is what we need in order to obey that. The same thing with with examples they often met in the first century and in an upper room, the we need to build an upper room and all meet there, that is a question that we may have. So even with examples that seemed to be approved, the question remains about making an application. Even within command, example, and inference, we need an interpretive process at play. And so again, I'll say that we often do this seamlessly. And so it can be very easy to say that we just read the Bible and do what it says that that is overly simplistic. And by simply saying that, I understand the meaning behind it, I probably won't argue with it. If you say that, because we don't need to reason a way Scripture, we do need to do what it says. But there is a process of interpretation within that within doing what it says, and it's not a blind man's errand, meaning we just simply disengage our mind and do what it says that that is not the intent of Scripture, as I understand it, we have to be fully engaged. Okay. So this process of interpretation is important. And this becomes as we look at the Lord's Supper about the function of examples and even what is enjoined or required versus what is an allowable option and maybe there are other options allowed. Okay. So with that in mind, I want to reason through a few passages on on the Lord suffer particularly as it relates to the second serving, okay. So the first

Jeremy Sweets  24:56
one is the purpose and so I have four Are Here I had more but I tried to limit these to the the second serving here. The purpose, what is the purpose of our assembling? And Acts chapter 20. You can even turn your Bibles over there and Acts chapter 20. We see that Paul is traveling, as he often did as he was on his preaching journeys. And it says that that he was at trow as in verse seven, on the first day of the week, when we were gathered together to break bread, gathered together to break bread. The first question that probably comes to my mind, as I look at this passage is what is meant by breaking bread. If you follow the flow of this, it says that that was their intent, or they came to break bread. That's an infinitive, which often indicates purpose, that was the reason for they're coming in. So my first question is, is this a common meal where they came together, take common meal, and worship. Besides that, you'll remember that in the first century, they often met in their homes. And so they wouldn't always have the distinction that we'll we'll make with a separate building. So is this a common meal? Or is this a a observance of the Lord's Supper, you'll notice that that was their intent. Now, the text says that they they listened to Paul preach, and Paul preached past midnight. And then it says in verse 11, unicus Falls, Paul shows the power of God by by raising Him, verse 11, when he had gone back up and had broken the bread and eaten, he talked with him a long while until daybreak. And so which occasion is this? Is this the Lord's Supper? Or is this the common meal? If this is the Lord's Supper, does this extend over into Monday night, or Monday morning? Or did they meet on Saturday night? So that after midnight, the preaching kept going, and they met very early and took the Lord's supper on Sunday morning? And I'm sorry, I don't have all the answers for that. Those are questions that I'm considering as I look at this. Okay, so that was the first question. Now, if we are to say that it is the Lord's Supper, there are many that would believe that this is a pattern. This is a required element of our Sunday Assemblies, that the Lord's Supper is the purpose that we come together. And so you can see how that would relate to the second serving. And so the argument would go along these lines that on Sunday morning, we partake, we all partake the Lord's Supper, that's why we're all coming together. But that's not why many of us come together when we meet a second time. And so the argument would go that if this purpose is embedded or required within the passage, and intended to be a uniform principle for all Sunday Assemblies, then then that plays into our purpose, and gathering. Okay. So those are some of my questions and thought processes. I look at this, there are others that would step back and say that, that this isn't a required element. This is a single example of what they did. Again, the common meal could have been included within this or could have been some other occasion that brought them to say that we need to observe the Lord's supper at this time. Now, I'll point out that the scriptures do not tell us those answers. In so many words, we're going to have to reason through this and think through this. And many times, we'll make assumptions and inferences about we believe this to be an ongoing kind of situation. But we need to be aware that that's what we're doing when we make those statements, okay, and reasoning that way. So Acts chapter 20 And verse seven. The purpose, I believe relates to the second serving many things that people have said about the second serving. What about communion? What about communion, you will begin to see a pattern or a kind of demarcation here as we talk about the second serving, whether the Lord's Supper is an individual affair or primarily an individual thing, often within a context of the community, or primarily an aspect of the community. Okay, so as an individual or community, and how does that play together? One of those thoughts I believe, comes together in First Corinthians chapter 10.

Jeremy Sweets  29:58
First Corinthians chapter 10. In, in this passage, Paul is talking about meat sacrifice to idols. Now in the first century, it was common for in the marketplace and a pagan society, that the meat sellers would sacrifice animals to their gods or to their idols. And then they would take that meat, put it in the marketplace and sell, sell it to others. Okay, so the world was pagan, most people didn't have a problem with that and probably appreciated. Okay, the meat were eaten at least it was sanctified according to their way of thinking. So Paul is addressing that issue. And he says in verse 16, is not the cup of blessing which we bless a sharing in the blood of Christ is not the bread which we break a sharing in the body of Christ. So the question when we talk about communion is, is this referencing an individual's communion with God? Or is the communion with brothers and sisters in Christ. So let me play kind of both sides of this, you remember that the context is talking about meat sacrificed to idols and what that meant for the person taking that in relationship to the so called Gods. There are those that would argue that this passage represents an individual communing with the Lord. As we follow that analogy of the subject discussed sacrificing to idols. There's also a reference in verse 16, that the sharing is in the blood of Christ, the sharing is in the body of Christ. Now, it doesn't go on to say who that is shared with, but the object of the sharing, you can see if someone's arguing for an individual emphasis would be with Christ in his blood and body. Okay. So there are those that would make the point that the emphasis is upon the individual and their relationship as they take the Lord suffer. There are others that would counter that. There's references in here, for example, in verse, Let me turn over here myself, the very next verse in verse 17. Says, since there is one bread, we who are many are one body, for we all partake of the one bread. There are others that would see emphasis upon the communal aspect. And they would point to a verse like verse 17, that talks about being one body and many members, but there is a oneness in that one body, they would look to the fact that even in this context, there had been association of the church. They would also look to the fact that what is considered as not only a person's relationship to an idol and meet sacrifice to idols, but maybe that relationship to another person, as you read through the passage, that consideration is what to do, not only yourselves, but what about somebody that has a conscious issue saying This is sad, and I couldn't take this? What should you do in relationship to that individual?

Jeremy Sweets  33:25
Okay, are you following that, that train of thought with a brother that says this is wrong? Paul's gonna say idols? They don't, they don't exist. They're not true. You focus on serving God. But if somebody says, I simply can't do this, how should you treat them? You know, there's kind of two main ways forward, I've got freedom, I do what I want, you kind of deal with it. That's not what Paul advocates. Instead, he says you need to be very considered, even to the fact of giving up your rights and freedoms for another. Okay. So the idea of communion, we began to look at this passage in question is this emphasizing an individual and their communion with God, or a community and their communion together? This relates to the second serving as you begin to think about what we are doing together, what is the purpose of what we're doing together? Are we quietly each individually reflecting? And so that that is the emphasis and I have a hard time even playing this, you may say that they're both emphasize and that that may be the point or the case. But you see how, as you lean one way or the other there begins to positions begin to fall in with that. Okay. So in the second serving, does is that something where we all need to be doing this simultaneously together, in order to properly observe it? Is it a community aspect? Or are we primarily allowing individuals to individually commune with God in that process? And, and assembly is the context in which that takes place? And so depending on how you answer this idea of communion may be made depend on how you take some of these positions. Okay? I may have made that as clear as mud, but we'll we'll move on. Okay, another aspect we see here is togetherness, togetherness. And so on Acts chapter 20. And verse seven, it says when we came together to break bread on the first day of the week, and so there was a coming together. And first Corinthians chapter 11, there's three times that it's mentioned in verses 17 through 20. When you come together, it says, and talks about the factions that exist among you. And so I've mentioned together three times, and two more times in that conclusion. Let me just give a quick rundown of First Corinthians chapter 11. And verses 17 through 22, you see the problem, okay. And I'm gonna have to do a very high level overview of of this passage, there's a lot more study that can be done. But the problem is that they were not considering others as they partook. And so there were some that were getting a lot. There were some that were getting none. Now we begin to start asking our questions about that first century context. Why is that? What was happening? Was it simply that there were some that were not waiting? Meaning maybe they had a job or worked as a slave, and it took them time to get there? And other says, Well, I'm not going to wait, I'm just going to take my own Lord's Supper. Is there that time difference? Or is it a situation where they were all together, but the prominent wealthy members, as was common in that culture were served first and prominently and in the special room, the banquet room, whereas those that were had a lower status were pushed to the outside? And there wasn't a, you know, a mingling, so to speak of that. And so is this a question of class, as we look at this? So that's some of the problem that's addressed. And some of the question questions we have, Paul points them to the original institution, in verses 23 through 26. And then he has some proposals for addressing the problem in verses 27 through 32. And so they needed to consider themselves and primarily consider what they were doing, and what were they doing. They were taking the Lord's Supper, what does that represent are pointless to the death and sacrifice of Christ for everyone else. And so it doesn't make a lot of sense, or it's not consistent to be selfish in the observance of the Lord's Supper,

Jeremy Sweets  38:04
so I'm gonna get mine and I unconcerned with others. It's not consistent to do that when the person we are honoring, gave his entire being for everyone else. So consider yourself, he says, Consider yourself, you'll again, see how this plays into a question will often say, examine himself, that means sit quietly and examine. Well, is that the case? Or is it the case of consider who we're remembering? And consider others within that context as well? Okay, so when you come together, the occasion of this problem was the Lord's Supper as they came together? Now the question comes in, was that simply what they did at that time? Or is that intended to be a prescription for all observances of the Lord's Supper? And so we began to ask some of those questions. This one's also difficult in that, even among those that would agree about together, there is a question about how that should be implemented. So I'm gonna come back over here to my notes instead of trying to hit this one on the fly. me find the place. Okay, let me say this, the situation we're attempting to answer is different than the first century context. The origin of the second serving is one of those that comes into question, and it's one that I've not been able to establish historically, but many people suggest that this started in World War Two with different schedules and the factory work. So this light development for some suggests an innovation that is separate from the New Testament pattern, but for others, there is a need to simply apply by the principles of Scripture to our different circumstances, there will always be different cultural circumstances because we live in different cultures. So the question is, which one is those? Furthermore, as we consider togetherness, is this an essential component? Within this? Does togetherness mean everyone takes at the same time or simultaneously? Does togetherness mean that at least one takes in the assembly? Does togetherness mean that it's the case that a break in service between the morning and night negates the togetherness? That you follow that? So? If you have a break, does that negate that together so that you're no longer together? And if so, how big does that timespan have to be? Or cannot be? Could someone come after our morning service after we've served the Lord's Supper? And would we be able to serve them individually? Is that together? What range? Are we looking at togetherness cannot be offered and taken to those who appear Sunday night that have not had an earlier opportunity. Is there a togetherness in that? So let me give you a couple of analogies on each side of this. First someone say that, you know, if we're going to sing together, I wouldn't think that one group would sing and watch the other one. Or one group would sit silent and watch the other sing. And then the other person would watch with sing and watch the other group take silently we would say that's not singing together. So the analogy is made that, you know, we need to take the Lord's supper at the same time. Understanding the trays take a little bit to get to the back. I've heard another analogy where somebody said, Well, this is akin to the Thanksgiving dinner, where we make the Thanksgiving dinner, we invite everyone there. But you know the light relatives, those that maybe even had to travel. And so they come. And even though they're late, we invite them to join in the same meal, even though we're not there eating together, they've come and we say still join us still get yourself a plate still eat there. And so those analogies point to this question of even when we agree on together as a principle, how is that applied? What is meant by together and all these different circumstances? Is it required that we would all be thinking about the Lord's Supper is some partake? A lot of these questions began to surface again, I don't have all the answers for you. main points are one more. And that is a consideration

Jeremy Sweets  42:54
when the text states to wait for one another as the conclusion states and verses 33 and 34. Remember the problem somewhere gorging themselves having more than enough and some had had nothing. He says there so then my brother and when you come to to eat, wait for one another, were some eating before others arrived, and they were not physically physically waiting on one another was simply a time issue where they didn't get there on time. And they refuse to wait there, you can see how that would have been a bigger issue when they didn't have cars, when they might not have had free schedules as we do on having weekends off from work. And so you can see how that may have been a consideration. Or were they all together at the church but practicing practicing social distinctions, where the wealthy and prominent members were served first and large quantity, maybe even to the neglect of those that had a lower status in society. When they are told to examine themselves, they are told to consider again the object of the Lord's Supper as the loving sacrifice of Christ for others. So as we think about the second serving here, what is involved in waiting for one another? Is this an app? Is this a instruction that we can basically say that it doesn't apply to us anymore, because we have a set time and we have cars, and our culture is not a situation where there's as much inability to get there. And so by setting that time, we're waiting, we're setting that time we're not trying to start ahead of time without other people's notice. Is that the instruction? Or is this a principle where we are going to make sure that there are provisions for everybody? So in one case, if you say there should only be one LORD supper service that, that waiting for one another that is accomplished by having a set time and making sure no one is left behind. And making sure there's ample provisions for everyone and not just a select few. There are others that would say that this is a principle of, of considering one another, of making sure that there are provisions for one another. That person would argue that we must offer the Lord's supper at the second serving, so that we are making provision for that person to observe the Lord's Supper. And if we don't do that, we're failing to honor this passage. Waiting means being considerate. And so why would we not be considerate of those that did not have an earlier opportunity to partake? I hope I was able to explain that that clearly what is meant by waiting for one another? And how can we honor that that phrase, is this a principle is how do we interpret that? Okay, my effort has been to be representative. Again, I hope that this has not been muddy. I realize also that I've taken you a little bit longer, maybe than my normal time. We're not benefited by by throwing our hands up and saying we can't understand this. But again, I'll say we're not benefited by oversimplifying this either. Other oversimplification saying there's only one way to see this, and I'm not going to acknowledge any others, that leads to arrogance of one's own position, a failure to consider other viable options that may be true when we are wrong, and also leads to intolerance of others, which can be very dangerous. My goal was to point people to the Word of God and to encourage personal and corporate study of this vital topic. Now, oftentimes, I would have lessons you know, okay, what do we do with this, but But thankfully, Conrad, my brother in Christ is going to take that for me. And based upon this lesson, he's going to offer some some guidance and some thoughts from Scripture about Okay, now we see this so what what what do we do with this? What are some things that that we can do at Broadmoor as we think about this, what are attitudes we have? What are things we need to be thinking about? And so I look forward to his lesson tonight. May God be glorified in our study. haven't talked about what it takes to become a Christian. But I appreciate Jeremy sermon or songs that directed us to our Almighty God.

Jeremy Sweets  47:38
As we talk about this, you may not see that connection, but I do is we talk about the Lord suffer, we're trying to please our Almighty God. That's, that's really what we're trying to do. So you may say, This is my new shirt. I'm not concerned with it. But I see this is important. Even if I don't agree with every single position. It's important, because we're trying to please God. If you're here this morning, and you're not a Christian, you have an opportunity to answer the invitation call of God Himself, God sent His Son for you. So you must believe that Jesus is the Christ, he must repent of your sins. That means turn away from a lifestyle of sin, and turn to a lifestyle of service to Him, confessing that Jesus is the Christ and being baptized in the water for forgiveness of your sins. That's a response to God's goodness. That's a reaction to all that God has done. So we couldn't do that on our own. But God has sent His Son so that we can have our sins washed away and you have an opportunity this morning to do that. If you're here this morning, and you are a Christian, and you're not living as you should you also need to make corrections you need to make changes. So we're going to be singing a song we shall stand before the throne. If there's any subject at this time. Please come as we stand and sing
