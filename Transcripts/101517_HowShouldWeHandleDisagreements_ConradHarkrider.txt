Do you have your Bibles and want to be turning to Romans chapter 14?

Conrad Harkrider  00:25
It's good to see each of you here tonight. Not sure if I was the only one who felt a little pressure and anticipation for this lesson tonight. I started thinking about the young, closer, who's called into the game and the bottom of the ninth inning, two outs, bases loaded, no pressure, just get out there and finish the game. Just close it out for us. So they told the young preacher to get up here and provide all the answers. Somebody asked me this morning, if I was going to put a list Jeremy's list up there and just have red circles around each of the options. And then we could just, you know, whatever, whatever he decides, and that's what we'll stick with. But I am grateful to be a part of a group where the elders ask the teachers and the preachers to speak on topics that are sensitive in nature. And I'm not going to be dealing specifically with the Lord's supper tonight. But hopefully some of the things that we discussed will be beneficial for you. The night before Jesus was crucified, he was in the Garden of Gethsemane praying. And it's interesting to see what was on the Lord's mind. What was he thinking about? What was consuming his thoughts. In John chapter 17, we're given a rather lengthy prayer of some of the things that Jesus was praying for. And we see that he was thinking about his disciples, he was concerned that they would be joined together, that they would be unified that God would keep them from the evil one. He also prayed for those who would believe on Him through their word, that's you and me. Any person who has ever accepted the gospel, Jesus prayed for us, that we too, would be unified, that we would have a connection with God, the Father and the Son, and also with one another. Unity is important. It's the reason why Jesus went to the cross so that we could have peace with God. But Jesus also gave his life in order for us to have peace with one another so that there would be unity among God's people. That sounds like a great goal. But what happens if there is something that comes up that we can't agree on? What do we do when there is a topic or issue or discussion where we don't see eye to eye? When we're not on the same page? Is it possible to maintain unity, within a relationship with in a family within a church within a marriage, when there are disagreements? And so tonight, our topic is how should we handle disagreements? And I want us to consider the attitude and approach that some of the lessons that we learned from Romans chapter 14, and the realization that anytime you have a group of people that are working together, that come from different backgrounds and perspectives and life experiences, you're going to have times where they see things differently. And so this text helps us to understand what to do with those types of situations. Read with me in Romans chapter 14, beginning in verse one.

Conrad Harkrider  04:16
It says, receive one who is weak in the faith, but not to disputes over doubtful things. For one believes he may eat all things, but he who is weak eats only vegetables. Let not him who eats despise him who does not eat. And let not him who does not eat judge him who eats for God has received him. Who are you to judge another servant? To his own master he stands or falls. Indeed he will be made to stand for God is able to make him stand. One person esteemed one day above another, another esteems everyday alike. Let each be fully convinced in his own mind. He observes the day observes it to the Lord and He does not observe the day to the Lord, He does not observe it. He who eats eats to the Lord, for He gives God thinks, and he who does not eat to the Lord, He does not eat and gives God thinks, for none of us lives to himself, and no one dies to himself. For if we live, we live to the Lord, and if we die, we die to the Lord. Therefore, whether we live or die, we are the Lord's. For to this in Christ died and rose and lived again, that he might be the Lord of both the dead and the living. But why do you judge your brother? Or why do you show contempt for your brother, for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ, for it is written, as I live says, The Lord, every knee shall bow to me, and every tongue shall confess to God. So then let each of us give an account of himself to God. Therefore, let us not judge one another anymore, but rather resolve this, not to put a stumbling block or a cause to fall in our brother's way. I know, and am convinced by the Lord Jesus, that there is nothing unclean of itself, but to him who considers anything to be unclean, to him and his unclean. Yet, if your brother is greed, because of your food, you are no longer walking in love. Do not destroy with your food, the one for whom Christ died. Therefore, do not let your good be spoken of as evil. For the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit. For he who serves Christ and these things is acceptable to God and approved by men. Therefore, let us pursue the things which make for peace and the things by which one may edify another, do not destroy the work of God for the sake of food. All things indeed are pure, but it is evil for the man who eats with the fence. It is good neither to eat meat, nor drink wine, nor do anything by which your brother stumbles, or is offended, or is made weak. Do you have faith, have it to yourself before God, happy as he who does not condemn himself in what he approves, but he who doubts is condemned if he eats, because he does not eat from faith, for whatever is not from faith, is sin. One of the amazing aspects of the Gospel

Conrad Harkrider  07:32
is that it has the power and the ability to bring people together. Think about it, there are people who are sitting in this room that would probably otherwise have never met each other, they would have never had any kind of relationship or dealings or connection. But yet in Christ were brought together. And that certainly was the case in the church at Rome, you had Jews and Gentiles, these people grew up with very different backgrounds. The Jews had specific types of customs and cultures, the clothes that they wore the practices and the festivities that they engaged in the types of food that they ate, they live very different lives. But when Paul writes to the Romans, he doesn't write to the Church of the Jews in Rome, and then the Church of the Gentiles in Rome, there is just one church. They are united together in Christ. In Romans, chapter 14, Paul addresses a situation that had come up with these two very different culturally diverse groups. And he says that in verse two, he is talking about this issue of eating meat, or of observing these days. And so just in the way of kind of breaking down some of the different things that he discusses here in the text, I believe there are two different points of view here. In verse two, he talks about those who are eating meat. These are people who felt that it was okay to eat and consume different types of meat, compared to those who felt like it was not appropriate to eat certain types of food. He also talks about in verse five, the one who sees every day as the same, there's no difference. There's no preference that's given to a specific day. And then there is one who has steams the day a day above the rest, they put special emphasis on the certain days. Paul gives certain warnings to each of these groups. He says to the one who eats meat, that he is in verse three, not to despise others. That word despise is not to show contempt or disregard for those who choose not to eat the meat. He says for the non meat eater, that they in verse three are not to judge. They have chosen to restrain themselves from doing something, but they're not to look on their brothers with any kind of, of judgment or condemnation. He also says that in chapter 15 And verse one, he describes those who are strong in the faith as he goes on with this argument into chapter 15. And that's compared to those in verse one who are weak in their faith. Weak is not a lack of conviction here, but possibly a maybe a misunderstanding or an inadequate knowledge, they're continuing to grow in this area. Those who are strong, have a inclusive view of the matter. That is they are okay, if they eat meat or don't eat meat there, either way is okay with them. And those who choose not to eat meat have a more restricted view on this topic, they're holding themselves or constraining themselves in some way. So what is Paul really talking about here? I think the context of the passage gives us some insight into what the underlying issue of this that's being discussed. Look at verse 14.

Conrad Harkrider  11:32
He says, I know and am convinced by the Lord Jesus, that there is nothing unclean of itself, but to him who considers anything to be unclean. To him it is unclean. Yet, if your brother is greed, because of your few, because of your food, you are no longer walking in love, do not destroy with your food, the one for whom Christ died. It appears the difference here relates to the eating of clean and unclean food, the Jews would have had very strict regulations on the types of things that they ate, they would have, the most notable of those was they didn't eat pork or other animals that were considered to be unclean. Gentile Romans, on the other hand, would have grown up eating bacon and pork chops and some of these other types of foods. And they would have seen no reason to abstain from these things unless it was not available, or if it didn't taste good, or if it was spoiled for some reason, but otherwise, they were free to partake. In regards to the days that they were observing, it seems that Paul is referring to the Jewish holy days rather than Gentile pagan observances. For the Jews, this would have been days like the Sabbath or Passover days that were set apart for reflection, they were special. And they were to have some type of remembrance on these days. But two different points of view on conducting or observing these these different elements. Back in 2010, we had a situation here at Broadmoor, where the building was flooded with some water, and it forced us to go and meet in another location. And because of the logistics, we decided to meet in the afternoons, I think it was around two o'clock, just have one service. And that was the only time we were together on Sundays. And I remember thinking to myself, during that time, there was a few Sunday mornings where we went to the grocery store. And I felt a little out of place there almost like I was doing something that I shouldn't be doing. I wasn't skipping the service. But it was like almost like if somebody from work saw me here, what would they think, you know, what, what would what would I have to say about that? And so you can imagine these Jews from their perspective, something that they have practiced and done their entire lives. And now all of a sudden they're being joined together with these other people who are not doing those things. You can see why it would have been very difficult or or hard for them as they were working through these issues. So why was this an issue in the early church? Because the Jews saw these observances. They saw these food laws as a necessary part of their service to God. For them. This wasn't something that was just optional, that they could turn on and off, they felt compelled to continue to do these things. Look at verse six. He says he who observes the day observes it to the Lord. This was something that they were doing in their service to God This was to the Lord or for the Lord. And so that was something that they felt strongly about. There was a young guy who visited Broadmoor a few years ago. And after the service, I went up and introduced myself to him. And I asked him if he had ever been to Broadmoor before. And he said, No. So I wanted to get some real time feedback. I said, Well, what did you think, you know, give us give us a survey right to my face, I guess. But I just asked him, you know, how did you like it? Or what did you think about it? He said, Well, it was okay. He said he didn't like the fact that we were not using the King James Version of the Bible. He said that where he came from, everyone used the King James. And he felt more comfortable if that was the translation that was being used. Now, that young man came and wanted to be a part of our group here, how do we handle that situation?

Conrad Harkrider  16:01
I think Romans 14 kind of gives you some insight into dealing with different perspectives. To the one who believes that this is the translation you should use, Paul would say do not judge. You shouldn't judge your brothers and sisters, because they're doing something different from you that you're not able to point to a scripture or text to show conclusively that it should not be done. And then for others who don't hold that view, Paul would say do not despise. That is you don't look down on the person. That's the that's the King James guy over there, he only uses King James, you know, and gossiping, or talking about the person or belittling them kind of making light of a view that they hold. So both people having a sense of patience, and care and respect for the other side. So I want to pause here or just interject something about a caution with Romans chapter 14. And that is to just say what this is not referring to. So a lot of people will use Romans 14 and stick some issues into this text and just to make a somewhat of a distinction between what this is not talking about. Look at chapter 13 And verse 13, Romans 1313. Just before this discussion here, Paul says, Let us walk properly as in the day not in revel, revelry, and drunkenness, not in lewdness and loss, not in strife and envy, but put on the Lord Jesus Christ and make no provision for the flesh for the flesh to fulfill its lusts. I believe Romans 14 is not addressing matters of morality. In the body of Christ, you don't have people who engage in getting drunk and then Christians who don't get drunk. You don't have people who practice sexual immorality and those who don't practice sexual immorality. Paul makes it pretty clear that we're to put off the works of darkness and to be renewed in Christ. And that's why in First Corinthians chapter five, when the brothers and sisters were tolerating a man who was living in sin, he says that Paul tells them that they if they allow this to continue, this is something that can affect the whole group, the 11 will continue to spread. So it was important for them to address that issue. It also, I believe, does not refer to core Christian doctrines. This would be things like the humanity of Jesus, that Jesus was a real person. That's not something that some people in the church can believe in. Some people cannot believe. The Gnostics were some during the first century that were teaching some of these doctrines, the fact that Christ had not actually come in the flesh. And you see the response from John and the other New Testament writers, they, they firmly stand up against those types of teaching and doctrine. Also, things like the validity of the resurrection, that Christ was raised from the dead. That's a core doctrine and principle of our faith. Paul says in first Corinthians that if Christ is not raised, then his preaching is empty, and their faith also is empty. So those things are essential. They're critical. When we think about what we believe what we teach and practice, even Jesus when he was dealing with the Pharisees, there was times where he would be very strong in his rebuke. He didn't just allow them to continue on with their traditions and binding things on people. He was stood them firmly, because they were not practicing the truth of God. So as we think about some of the practical applications from this example, Romans 14, what should we do if we have a disagreement, if we're not seeing eye to eye with a brother or sister? Well, first of all, look at what verse five says. Romans 14 And five, he says, one person esteems, one day above another, another esteems everyday alike, let each be fully convinced in his own mind.

Conrad Harkrider  20:35
Paul says that you have two people who are doing doing two different things. One is a steaming the day, the other is treating every day alike. But he says the emphasis should be on that each one is fully convinced in their mind. And that means that we should have confidence and certainty in the things that we believe in the things that we practice. Look at chapter 14 And verse 23, Chapter 14 In verse 23, he says, But he who doubts is condemned if he eats, because he does not eat from faith, for whatever is not from faith is sin. You see the point, even if it wasn't wrong for him to eat, if he believes that it was wrong, and he goes ahead, and he partakes in that he would be condemned, it would be wrong for him to partake in that if you felt that it was going against his conscience. So there should be no doubting our actions should be done on the basis of faith. Let's say that you have a brother or sister who believes that it is wrong to participate in Halloween. And they feel that way, because there's an association with demons and with the devil and witches, and there's some pagan origins, and they so they feel that it's not appropriate for a Christian to be involved in those things. If that person were invited to a Halloween party, and they went to the party, and they felt bad about it, like they shouldn't be there. It would be inappropriate or wrong. For them to partake in that. We need to follow our conscience if our conscience is telling us not to do something, that we should stay away from it. We need to be assured of what we believe. So you ask well, what happens if your conscience is misinformed? What if your conscience is guiding you or telling you to do something that is not right or doesn't really hold to the truth of God's word? Because none of us have a perfect knowledge. None of us have direct revelation from God where we have perfect understanding of all that God intends for us to do. That's why it's critical for us to continue to study. We need God's Word. We need to read God's word, we need to ask questions, we need to talk to others about it. We need to engage in Bible study where we listen to different perspectives and ideas and thoughts. We need to listen to teachers and try to gain wisdom and insight from those who have lived life and who have experiences that we might not have. And if there is an issue that comes up, we should always be asking the question, what does the Bible say about this? What is God's word? What kind of light does it shed on this topic? Or on this area? In Philippians, chapter one and verse nine. Paul wrote to the Philippians. And he said, It is my prayer that your love may abound more and more with knowledge and all discernment, so that you may approve what is excellent, and so be pure and blameless for the day of Christ. Philippians, one nine and 10. Paul is praying that they would have bound and increase in their love, and in their knowledge and discernment. You remember what Solomon asked for? When God said you could have anything he said, I need wisdom. I need to be able to discern and understand what's right. And so it is for us today, through studying and reading and through discussions with one another, we can come to a better understanding of God's will. If I grew up, and was taught that it was not appropriate to sit next to someone who had a different skin color than me. And I was fully convinced in my mind that that's what I should do. That it wouldn't be right for me to talk or sit with someone of a different race. Does that make it okay? If a brother came to me and said look, you are misguided on this point. This is something that is not supported by the scriptures. There in Christ there. is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free male, nor female, black, or white. And so for all of us, it's essential to be receptive to constantly being going, going back to the Scripture so we can train our senses and our understanding. It acts chapter 17, in verse 32, after Paul has speak it spoken to the Greeks,

Conrad Harkrider  25:25
it says Now when they heard of the resurrection of the dead, some mocked, but other said, we will hear you again about this. There's something that is different that we come across or that someone else believes, do we just mock it that and say that's, we just throw it off to the side? Or are we the type of people who say, we'll hear you again, we want to reason this out. We want to better understand this perspective, and try to gain a better appreciation for it. Also, notice what verse 10 says, Romans 14 In verse 10, he says, Why do you judge your brother? Or why do you show contempt for your brother, for we shall all stand before the judgment seat of Christ, for his written, as I live says, The Lord, every knee shall bow to me and every tongue shall confess to God. So then each of us shall give an account of himself to God. Therefore, let us not judge one another anymore, but rather resolve this not to put a stumbling block or a cause to fall in our brothers way. It's important for us to remember that judgment is ultimately to be reserved for God. It is not our place to condemn a brother or sister to stand in the place of God. And to assume that we have all of the information that we know, their background where they came from their life experiences, what has brought them to this point. Only God is in the position to know the hearts of men, we don't have that type of insight and understanding. And so we need to reserve that aspect for God. Within a congregation, there are a wide array of views on the clothes that we wear, in the service, the types of clothes that people come and wear to the service, and then in our own personal lives when it comes to things like modesty. And, you know, to be honest with you, there's a lot of options out there that can make it very challenging when someone, particularly females go to the store, there's numerous options, there's the long sleeve and a half sleeve and the short sleeve and the nose sleeve. And there's the round neck and the V neck and the sweetheart and it just goes on and on. And now I have three daughters. So I'm studying up on these things. But people have to make decisions for themselves. What might be uncomfortable for my family may not be uncomfortable for someone else. And this is something that we can discuss and study and have conversations about. There should be time for older to give perspective to younger and we should be receptive and willing to listen. But at the end of the day, it is not our place to determine someone's eternal destiny. Those matters should be left to the Lord. Look at what he says in verse four. He says, Who are you to judge another servant to his own master, he stands or falls indeed, he will be made to stand for God is able to make him stand. God can make this brother or sister stand regardless of what I think about them, and what I've judged about their life. The Lord is the one who can either extend grace or who can place judgment. Also notice verse 19. In verse 19, he says, Therefore, let us pursue the things which make for peace and the things by which one may edify another. When dealing with a disagreement or point of contention, we need to consider others within the body of Christ. Our actions and our practices should never be done in a vacuum, where we are the only person that is under consideration. We're only thinking about what I want or what I need or how I feel about this particular issue. We should always be thinking about how is this going to affect the people around me? How are my brothers going to be impacted by this? Is this something that is going to build up and strengthen and edify or is this something that might be caused for hindrance are a stumbling block in their way. Look at verse 14. He says, I know and am convinced by the Lord Jesus that there is nothing unclean of itself. But to him who considers anything to be unclean. To him, it is unclean. Paul says I'm convinced that it is okay to eat these meats.

Conrad Harkrider  30:23
But look at verse 21. He says, It is neither good to eat meat, nor drink wine or do anything by which your brother stumbles. Here's something that Paul felt okay with, that he had the liberty to do. And yet he says, I'm going to put this aside, I'm going to give up my rights, so as not to cause offence for my brother. Notice that the motivation for this is love. Look at verse 15. He says, Yet, if your brother is greed, because of your food, you are no longer walking in love, do not destroy your did not destroy with your food, the one for whom Christ died. He says Christ gave His life for this brother, he died for this brother. And the way that you should see that one is in a spirit of love and concern. around the holidays, we used to go up to my grandparents house, and my grandmother would always make these casserole dishes to feed the masses, everybody come over, and she just feed us feed us all. At one time, I got up to the front of the line, there was two different casserole dishes that looked basically the exact same. And she explained that she said, Now this one has olives, and this one does not have olives. And I said, Well, what's the need for two dishes? She said, Well, some of my children and grandchildren really like olives, and some of them don't. So I wanted everyone to be happy. She was motivated at us out of a sense of, of love of concern. Now, I'm not saying we have to accommodate every wish that our kids have in terms of food preferences, but hopefully you see my point, she cared about the feelings of each person, she wanted us to come away with a fullness and a satisfaction from the meal. And that's a lot different than saying there are all lives in this. And you can either eat it or go hungry. An attitude that says I don't have any regard for your preference, or what you might like or think about this topic. We should also ask the question, Does this cause another to stumble, there are certain things that I may be comfortable with that may put a hindrance in front of my brother, there was a young lady who had been raised, that it was not right for a Christian to engage in gambling. And so she felt that it was wrong to play cards and to play poker or any kind of game like that, that was associated with gambling. She went over to a groups how to a person's house, and there was a group of young people that were playing a game, and the game required rolling dice. And she didn't feel okay with that. And so the group came up with a an alternative. They took numbers, they wrote down numbers on pieces of paper, and they put them into a hat. And then they just drew out the numbers. And that's how each person would take their turn. And that is so different from instead, they could have said why does it matter? You need to just get over it. You're the only person who feels this way, why should we accommodate you. But instead, they were willing to give something up that they were okay with in order to help this sister. If there is a brother or sister who feels that it's wrong to go to a restaurant that serves lots of alcohol, then I shouldn't invite that brother or sister to go there for lunch, because it might be a cause for stumbling for them. If there is a time where we are doing something that is going to put a stumbling block in front of our brother or sister we should have second thoughts it should cause us to pause and reconsider. But at the same time, I believe you can show consideration without having to adopt these practices. It doesn't mean that we no longer use dice ever, or we can't go to restaurants, or that I have to say AMEN At the conclusion of every prayer because that's what one of my brothers believes. The convictions of another don't force us to do the same thing. But as Paul tells Paul doesn't tell these brother ins these brothers not to eat meat but Rather, we must exhibit patience and consider the needs of others is what I'm doing is that compelling them or causing them to do something that's going to go against their conscience? And if it does, I believe we're violating the principle that Paul's laying out here.

Conrad Harkrider  35:19
Well, I want to close tonight with something from verse 17. Look at verse 17. He says, For the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness, and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit. It's critical for us to maintain focus on the main thing. Paul says that God's Kingdom is not about eating and drinking, but instead about righteousness, and joy and peace in the Holy Spirit. And so it is anytime we have a disagreement or a point of contention with our brothers. We need to constantly remind ourselves, what is the main thing that we're striving for? What is the goal, the purpose of the Body of Christ. And so I would encourage you, if you are going to get energized about something, get energized about helping the last. If you're going to get really worked up over something get worked up over the fact that there are many people who have not heard about the Lord. If you're gonna get annoyed, get annoyed that Satan continues to wreak wreak havoc on people's lives, that there are people who are living in sin and have never seen God's goodness. Keep the main thing the main thing, Senator our minds on serving God and having our lives transformed, so that one day we can stand before him. Well, I hope these things have been helpful to you. And as it is, with any lesson or Bible study or discussion that we have, there's no one single perfect instance that is going to answer or solve all of our questions. That's why in Christ, it is a process of growth. We're trying to grow to maturity and that comes by feeding on the milk of God's word continuing to come back to the things that we have been that we have been given. So we're going to close with an invitation if there's something that we can do to encourage you and your walk with the Lord, you can come down to the front as we stand and sing
