If you have your Bibles and want to be turning to Romans, the 12th chapter, Romans chapter 12. So good to see all of you here this morning, if you are visiting with us, we'd ask that you take a moment and fill out one of those visitor cards that's in front of you. And you can leave that on the queue or hand it to one of the members of the ushers in the back as you're heading out, and we'd like to have a record of of you being with us today.

I want to start with a question just get you thinking about this idea of how people know that you are a Christian. How do people know that you and I are followers of Christ. When I was in college, there was a student organization, a group at the school where I went called the Corps of Cadets. And it's basically like a large ROTC, and they use military style tactics and, and methods in order to promote leadership among the students that join the organization. And there are a number of things that really set them apart when you're on campus, you can't miss them. For example, they wear these very flattering, light brown uniforms that have long pants, and they wear them Monday through Friday, whether it's 100 degrees outside or not, they cut their hair very short, I think the freshmen have to basically shave their heads, they engage in physical activities, you often see them on campus, running around and doing various drill tactics, oftentimes very early in the morning. So you get to wear a uniform, cut off all your hair, and get up before the sun. Does that something sound like something that you would sign up for, and I could never really understand why people were joining this, this group. I went to my first football game as a freshman and my seats were on the third deck. In the very last row, we were up there with the birds. And the players looked like ants down on the field. But I could see this light brown block about the 40 yard line about 10 rows up. And lo and behold, it was the Corps of Cadets. And I thought to myself, you know, maybe I should pick up an application for that. Maybe it's not so bad after all having that short haircut. But they were easy to identify. They were easy to see they stood out they had the same dress, the same hairstyle, they engaged in the same activities. How is it that people know that you and I are Christians, God hasn't prescribed any type of uniform or hairstyle for us. But Jesus said that all men will know that you are my disciples if you would, if you have love for one another. This morning, we're going to look at a text from the book of Romans as we think about what it means to be a disciple, a follower of the Lord. And Paul shows us that love is, is what makes us stand out. It's more more than anything, our love for each other. Our love for the Lord is what causes us to be different. So think with me about this idea of a love that stands out and read with me from Romans chapter 12, beginning in verse nine. Romans 12 In verse nine, it says, Let love be genuine. Abhor what is evil. Hold fast to what is good. Love one another with brotherly affection. outdo one another in showing honor, do not be slothful in zeal, be fervent in spirits serve the Lord. rejoice in hope, be patient in tribulation, be constant in prayer, contribute to the needs of the saints, and seek to show hospitality.

Conrad Harkrider  04:14
Romans chapter 12 is noticeably different from the rest of what Paul has said in this letter. In the first 11 chapters he he expounds upon these lofty ideas about the gospel and about how God justifies men and women, how He reconciles them to himself. And he often uses very long paragraphs to make his point to explain himself. But here in Romans 12, he changes his style and he gives some very practical real life instructions very short and to the point directives here. He starts the chapter Romans 12, calling on the believers to present themselves as a living sacrifice to The Lord, just as animals were offered up in the Old Testament, and they, the bodies were sacrificed. So now God is designed for his people to offer their bodies and their lives and hearts as a sacrifice to the Lord. But Paul doesn't just stop there and say, be a living sacrifice, and then move on know he goes into very specific applications. In other words, he shows his readers what it means to be a living sacrifice, what it means to not be conformed to this world, but be transformed. And he gives us a picture into what it looks like to be a Christian. And again, one of the central components we see in these verses is our love for others. Look at verse nine, verse nine, let love be genuine, abhor what is evil, hold fast, to what is good. First of all, notice that love that stands out is a love that is genuine. He says in verse nine, it is without hypocrisy, it is sincere, it is real, and authentic. It is non hypocritical love, it's not a love that plays the part or is acting is just pretending to be one thing. But it's all a show in the context. Paul is writing to a group of people that were made up of some very different groups. The a number of these, these Christians grew up in Jewish families, they went to synagogue, when they were younger, they studied the scriptures, they held to the traditions of their fathers, they tried to live a life that was different that was separate from the culture that they were in. And they held those things as very important, very, very dear to them. And then on the other side, you have a group of Gentiles of Romans, that did not grow up reading the scriptures. They grew up believing in a multitude of Gods not just one, in Romans chapter one and verse 25. It says they worship the creature, rather than the Creator in their lives. It to many extent, were filled with all kinds of immorality, and ungodliness. But now, now they have something in common. Now God has brought these two very different groups together, and they are going to worship together, they're going to work together, they're going to pray together and not just coexist. But Paul says they are to love one another. And that love is not just to be phony or made up but is to be real, genuine love. We have similar challenges today. Many of us grew up in very different backgrounds. We have people from all walks of life here in the body of Christ, this is not a 30 and under, or 20. And under Group, there's young and old, there's married and single, there's people who have different experiences and perspectives and interests, and different things that they've encountered in their life that shape who they are today. And yet we are called not just to get along, not just to tolerate each other. But to love one another. You know, it's so common today, in our culture for people to say one thing, and be thinking something completely different. Have you seen this happen? We might say things like, it was great to see you, or I had such a good time. Or we should do this again. And then the person walks away, and we say to ourselves, I can't stand them. Or they're so annoying, or I can't believe what they were wearing. And it says if we are nice and pleasant to a person's face, but when they turn around and they're gone, and then we feel like we can drop our true feelings. You remember what Judas did in the garden? Right? He came up and he said, Greetings rabbi. And he extended a kiss and that's a show of affection and warmth. But we know what was going on underneath that right?

Conrad Harkrider  09:16
He was full of selfish motives. He had his own interests at heart. He was thinking about greed and his own desires. And all of that caused him to be blinded. He didn't realize what was happening. But he was delivering the Son of God into the hands of evil men. We need to be careful not just to be playing the part not just to be acting it out, but to have this genuine love. Also notice from this text, that verse 10 says we are to love one another with a brotherly affection. There should be a a family type of love that exists in the body of Christ with our children. Do we hold every mistake against them? Do we knit Pick and criticize and critique every little thing that they do? Or do we extend grace to them? Do we forgive them? Do we have their best interests at heart? are we pulling for them? Are we rooting for them, wanting them to excel and to do well. And that's the way it should be in the body of Christ where we want what's best for one another, we give the benefit of the doubt, we are quick to forgive and look past mistakes and wrongs. genuine love is more than just words. It's more than just a good thought or an idea. Several years ago, one of our kids was running up the stairs, some concrete steps outside, and she tripped and fell and landed on her forehead. And we got to make our first visit to the ER. And at the time, we were pretty overwhelmed and shocked. And we were with a group of Christians. And one of the couples that was there asked us, they said, You want us to go with you to the emergency room. And we sort of said, we don't know, we're not sure if we'll need anything. Well, they ended up coming. They came to the ER and they ended up staying for the entire two hours that we were there. genuine love offers to help. But it's more than just a nice gesture, it backs it up with action. And that's the type of love that real authentic love that stands out. Also notice the second half of verse nine. He says, abhor what is evil and hold fast to what is good. A love that stands out is a love that seeks after good. He says that we need to hold fast to it that we need to cling to what is good to hold on to it and not let go. We are to love and seek those things that are honorable that are good and right and holy. But notice there's another part to this. It's not just that we're loving and seeking the things that are good. But the first part of that he says we are do abhor what is evil, to despise or detested. It's something that is to be hated and avoided. A lot of people think that following Jesus is all about things that are positive, that we are to be encouraging that we are people of love that we don't pass any judgment that there's never anything negative or upsetting that a Christian would say or do to another person. But Paul says here that there are things that are good. And then there are things, they're evil, and those things that are evil are to be abhorred. Now of course we need to separate people from actions Jesus had love for people who were living in sin. He ate with tax collectors and prostitutes. And he saw a difference between what they were engaging in and who they were as a person. But Jesus still recognize sin for what it was he was grieved in his heart when he saw people who were unwilling to change who were unwilling to listen and, and to turn back to God and he would get frustrated and angered when he saw those situations. And so the question is, do we abhor what is evil? Do we feel a sense of disgust or repulsion when it comes to how we view sin? I think this comes naturally with certain types of sin. We think about a murderer or somebody who abuses the child or somebody who engages in rape those things are, are shameful and wrong. But what about the sins that are a little closer to home? What about things like gossip, or anger, or lust? What about things like

Conrad Harkrider  13:52
covetousness or bragging and being arrogant, many of the things that Paul mentions in Romans, chapter one, those are not as easy to have disdain and to look down and abhor because they're things that many times we enjoy. There's some type of temptation and they have an allotment to us. In Romans chapter 12. In verse two, Paul urges them to not be conformed to the world but to be transformed. And how do we do that? We have to change our minds to renew our minds and change the way that we think we have to change the way we think about sin. The way we think about other people to see other people the way that God see that sees them. Let me let me ask you this. If you really hate something, will you find it funny? If you really despise something? Will it be something that is entertaining to you that is amusing to you? If you hate something, are you going to be okay watching it or listening to it or really Eating about it or looking at a picture of it. I think too often we aren't bothered by movies, and shows and songs, and jokes, and pictures or, or other things that are promoting sinful activity or they have some type of sinful behavior. We don't hate those things or abhor them because it doesn't bother us. We don't we don't see the sin. We don't see it for what it is and we become desensitized to it. A love that stands out is one that seeks good, abhors what is evil, and seeks after good. Seeking good is more than just a once a week type of activity is something that we do on an ongoing, consistent basis. Every day we're engaging in Bible study and thinking about spiritual things. We're praying, we're spending time with other Christians, we're looking for ways to serve and all this he says that we have to hold on cling to what is good. In Galatians chapter six and verse nine, he says let us not grow weary in doing good for in due season we will reap if we do not give up. Don't get tired of doing what's good. It's something to be pursued. It's something to be continued on in our lives. And the Christian knows that those things will ultimately provide us a reward. So a love that seeks after good. Also notice that a love that stands out is a love that is diligent, a love that is diligent. Look at the second half of verse 10. He says Love one another with brotherly affection. outdo one another in showing honor, do not be slothful in zeal, verse 11, fervent in spirit serve the Lord. This is a love that is it's taking initiative. It's going above and beyond it's seeking to do more than what's required. There is this, this eagerness, this ambition that you see. And notice it's not for my own selfish ambition or for my own pursuits or desires. But we are trying to outdo one another in showing honor. This is for the benefit of our brothers and sisters in Christ. Look at verse 11. He says, Do not be slothful. Don't be lazy in your zeal, but instead we are to be forgiven. This carries with it the idea of a fire that is burning. The fervency is is like a flame that grows and it burns hot, it provides heat to everything that's around it, it glows and lights up the darkness. And that's the idea here that our faith that our service to God would be like that burning, blazing Fire. In John chapter 21. After the Lord had risen from the dead, the disciples were out on a fishing excursion excursion. And they had been out there all night. They've been trying to fish and they hadn't caught anything. And when the morning came, there was a man who was standing on the shore. And he told them to cast their nets on the other side of the boat. And so they did. And what happened next, there was an enormous amount of fish that came into that so much so that they couldn't even pull it in to the boat. In John chapter 21.

Conrad Harkrider  18:35
In verse seven, it says, that the disciple whom Jesus loved therefore said to Peter, it is the Lord. And when Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord he put on his outer garment, for he was stripped for work, he threw himself into the sea. Peter jumps in to the water, forget about the boat, forget about the fish, forget about your clothes getting wet. Forget about having to swim all the way to shore, he must have been a good swimmer, having all this clothes on and swimming out, to make it back to the land. But Peter jumps in when I see here is that Peter wasn't allowing anything to stand in between him and the Lord. When he comes to that realization. When he understands who it is that's standing in front of him, he jumps in. There's no indifference, there's no lack of desire. There's no oh, I guess the Lord showed up? No, he is so overwhelmed and excited that he jumps out of the boat in to the water. Isn't that how we should be in our walk with Christ? And isn't that how many of us or when we first become Christians, oftentimes we are on fire where we wanted to go out and tell everyone about the Lord. We're being diligent in reading our Bibles and talking to others in our are praying in our service to God. And then over time that starts to wear off. When I was in school, there was a young guy that was converted. And after he became a Christian, he would take his Bible with him everywhere. This is before Bible on your phone. And so he literally take his Bible, we'd be going out to dinner, and he'd have his Bible with him. And he always asked you say, you guys want to have a Bible study after we're done? We did go in a movie. He's carrying his Bible. He said, y'all want to have a Bible study. And after a while, we're like, what is what's wrong with you, you know, like, Bible study happens at the church building. But to him, it was something that he couldn't get enough of. It was it was part of he was just drinking, it was eating it up. He was consuming God's word. And that same level of excitement. The challenge is for us to be able to maintain that passion and that desire, not just when we come to the Lord, but throughout our Christian lives. The Lord condemned the church in Laodicea, not because they had completely turned away, not because they had denounced their faith in Christ, but a revelation chapter three and verse 15. He says, I know your deeds that you are neither hot nor cold, that you're neither cold nor hot, I wish that you were either. I wish that you were either one or the other. He condemns them for being lukewarm for being in the middle for not being passionate. And having this desire, and this energy, God is looking for the same type of passion, in our service to Him that we show, in our hobbies, in our planning of a vacation, in our decorating of our house, in our staying up late to watch our team to see if they can make it in that final inning. God wants our whole heart to be engaged with him. And how do we do that? Spending time in His Word, spending time with his people, spending less time thinking about and focusing on the things of the world and more time on heavenly things on things that are above. This is a love that is diligent that is on fire for God. It's a love that looks for opportunities to serve. Look at verse 13. He says, contribute to the needs of the saints and seek to show hospitality Are you an I am? Are we seeking to show hospitality? Are we pursuing it? are we practicing it in our daily lives? You know, hospitality is one of those things that I think we often put to the side because we feel like that it's it's too much for us. We don't have a big house or we don't have enough space, or we feel inadequate, we're not in a position to make a meal for a bunch of people or for someone else to come in and see our huge mess. That's that's our living room.

Conrad Harkrider  23:00
Right? We feel self conscious about it. But let me tell you that hospitality doesn't have to involve the most elaborate meal. It doesn't have to be anything over the top. When we were in school, there was a young, there was a couple at the church there. They used to have students over on Sunday nights after church to play cards. And what they would do for dinner is they would have build your own sandwich. And they would just put everything out on the counter there, the bread, the cheese, the meat, the condiments, and we would make dinner for ourselves. And you know what we loved it, getting to pick exactly what we want and being able to spend time together building those relationships. All because there was a couple that opened their home that extended themselves to a group of young people. A love that is diligent is a love that is stepping out. It's seeking for opportunities to help and serve others. And finally, as we close the lesson, notice first 12 Verse 12 says rejoice in hope, be patient in tribulation, be constant in prayer. A love that stands out is a love that is constant, a love that rejoices in hope. Our hope is something that is not just here one day and gone the next. But it is rather unshakable. It is ever before us. It's never fading or diminishing. And in that that's something that we can rejoice. He says to be patient or to persevere in tribulation. When difficulties come whether it's some type of sickness, a tragedy that happens to our family, or outside persecution, he says to be patient, to not give up to not doubt or question God to not turn your back on your faith but to keep going to don't give up to push through it Romans 10 After five, in verse three, he says not only that, but we rejoice in our sufferings, knowing that suffering produces endurance and endurance, produces character and character produces hope. The Christian has a different perspective on suffering, because we understand that it's producing something within us, is producing a character and a strength within us. That helps us meet future challenges. And finally, in verse 12, he says, to be constant in prayer, how important it is for us to be reminded of our need to pray. And not just pray periodically, but to be regular to be praying without ceasing, as Paul says, to make it an ongoing part of our walk, prayers, knots, prayer is not something that necessarily has to be done in a dark closet, it can be done when you're in the car, when you're at work, when you face temptation, talking to God in the midst of our lives, making it more of a regular part, an ongoing thing that we do. Prayer is vital for us because it helps us to reflect and to refocus on the things that are most important to think about what's going on outside of us as we pray for brothers and sisters and the needs that are around us. The Lord's desire is for us to have a constant love for him and his people, not something that is present today. And then non existent next month. But day after day, week, after week, year after year, is a love that is steady and reliable. And isn't that the idea of being faithful, of staying committed to something of holding to our convictions, not just for a few weeks, but for 1020 30 years into our life. And when we show that type of unloyal, unwavering service to the Lord. That's a love that that's a commitment that stands out and has an impression and an impact on families, friends, co workers, people in the community, they can see our faith and our service to God. I can still remember my grandfather, a few months before he passed, he passed away his health was starting to fail. And I can remember, on a Wednesday night we lived in, they lived up in Colorado, and it was snowing outside.

Conrad Harkrider  27:32
And yet he insisted that we make provision for him to be able to come to Bible class. And so we did we used a wheelchair we were able to get him to the service. A faith that is constant, a faith that doesn't waver that continues on even until the end of our lives. God is looking for us to be genuine in our service to Him. To have to have a faith and a love that seeks after what is good that turns away from evil. God wants us to be enthusiastic and to show energy and passion and to be diligent in our service. And ultimately, a faith that is pleasing to God is one that is constant that continues on in service to the Lord. We're going to close this morning with a song if there's something that we can do to encourage you in your walk with Christ. If you need to respond to the gospel and become a Christian by confessing your faith in Jesus, being baptized and being raised to walk in newness of life, please come down to the front. as together we stand and sing
