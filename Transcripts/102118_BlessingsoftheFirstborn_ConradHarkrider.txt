It's good to see you here this morning if you have your Bibles or want to be turning to Hebrews the 12 chapter

Conrad Harkrider  00:18
Hebrews chapter 12. The last time I had an opportunity to preach here at Broadmoor was about six weeks ago. And since then we had our fourth child and a lot has changed. In that short period of time. I feel like I'm several years older somehow. That's the lack of sleep or the more kids or, or whatever it may be. But we are so blessed and we have much to be thankful for. We have a healthy, baby boy, we have three caring, older sisters who love to help and hold the baby. We've had to set a few guidelines about that you can't touch the baby's eyes. Those are off limits, and you're not allowed to carry the baby if you see how they took their dolls around. It's like a one arm chokehold. So no carrying baby brother. But they are, they are a blessing. We're especially grateful to our family here at Broadmoor, you've been so supportive to us with the meals that have met all kinds of allergy and dietary restrictions. And you've brought presents and gifts, blankets, cards, you've sent texts, you've come to visit us, you've watched our kids for us, when we've come to worship, you've helped us get into the building and out of the building. If it's raining out there, people have gone to get our car and curbside service. I told my wife I said, if you want this special treatment, all you have to do is have another kid. She said, Well, you can have the next one. But on behalf of our family, I want to thank all of you for what you've done to help us and we feel so blessed and privileged to be a part of a special group that meets here abroad work. Over the past couple of years, we've been pretty busy here at Broadmoor when it comes to the babies and the children. And if you were to count it up, there have been nine boys firstborn boys that have been born in the last three years, I had to cut it off at some at some point. But in about the last three years, there have been nine sons firstborn sons that have come into these families. So let's see if I can name these here. Captain Reed, Max Henry, Lucas, Rayland.

Chandler, Hudson and Jude I got Jude out of order there. But nine boys, firstborn sons, there is something special about them. They're seen as the protector of the family, they look after their siblings, they're often given responsibilities, Dad shows them how to do things. Here's the weedeater. Here's the rake. Now you know how to use it. Quite often they're natural leaders in the family, they blazed the trail, they set the bar for their other siblings. When you may recall in the scriptures that the firstborn son was given special rights and privileges in the Law of Moses, there were specific provisions that dealt with the firstborn son. It is a theme and a concept that's mentioned throughout the scriptures frequently in the Old Testament. And I believe that the blessings that were given to the firstborn are a shadow of what all of us received in Christ. So I want to talk for just a few moments about the blessings of the firstborn. We'll look at a few of those blessings and then get to Hebrews 12 and make some applications. First of all, there was a special distinction that was given to the first board. He was seen as the heir of the family, the one that would ultimately carry on the name he would receive the possessions of his family's inheritance. In Genesis chapter 15, there's an exchange that Abraham and God have together and Abraham, it says, Behold, you have given me no offspring and then a member of my household will be my heir. He's referring to one of his servants, they're this man and behold, the word of the Lord came to him. This man shall not be your heir. You're very Every own son shall be your heir. And he brought him outside and said, Look toward heaven and Number the Stars if you're able to number them, then he said to them, so shall your offspring be. The Lord tells him that this servant of his is not going to be his heir. But he says, Your very own son, that is one that comes from your body will ultimately be your air. This is the one that God was going to give to them. Of course, God would miraculously bless Abraham and Sarah with their son, Isaac, Isaac received a distinction because he was the son of son of promise, but all four firstborn sons would have held a place of honor and significance within the family. In this case, Abraham would have passed on his herds and flocks and his business to this promised child. But what if you had multiple sons, as the case was with Isaac when he had Esau and Jacob, the firstborn son was entitled to a birthright, he would receive a double portion of the inheritance if you had two sons, the oldest would receive two thirds and the younger, a third of of the possessions. And if you remember, Esau sold his birthright to Jacob for a bowl of soup that was an expensive dinner that he exchanged. But notice what Deuteronomy chapter 21 And verse 17 says, this is in the context of a person who has multiple wives, and where one is loved and one is unloved, as it was the case with Rachel and Leah and Jacob's family, but it says, regarding the husband, he shall acknowledge the firstborn, the son of the unloved by giving him a double portion of all that he has, for he is the first fruits of his strength, the right of the firstborn is his there is a special privilege or right of the firstborn. And this child, his son was to be given a double portion, he is the beginning of his strength, and he would receive this special blessing. Probably the most well known reference to the firstborn in the Old Testament, is during the time of the Egyptian bondage when God brought the 10th plague upon the land upon Pharaoh and the Egyptians, and we see the death of the firstborn. But in that event, there's this great deliverance because God offers a substitution for his people. They sacrifice or they offer up these lambs and goats, and they put the blood upon the doorpost and the destroyer, the angel passes over their homes, and they're spared. In Exodus chapter four and verse 22, it says, Then you shall say to Pharaoh that says, The Lord Israel is my firstborn son, and I say to you, let my son go, that he may serve me if you refuse to let him go, Behold, I will kill your firstborn son. It's interesting that God refers to the nation of Israel as his firstborn. And certainly they were a special treasure in the eyes of the Lord doesn't mean that God didn't love other peoples and nations. But Israel had a distinct place in God's plan, God's redemptive plan for the world. And it's also interesting to note at the very beginning, Moses brings this message to Pharaoh, that it is going to cost him his firstborn before any of the plagues have come, he warns him that this is going to be the end result. In Exodus chapter 11. In verse four, speaking about this event, it says, So Moses said, Thus says the Lord about midnight, I will go out in the midst of Egypt, and every firstborn in the land of Egypt shall die from the firstborn of Pharaoh who sits on the throne, even to the firstborn of the slave girl who is behind the hand mill, and all the firstborn of the cattle. So a couple of things to note here, this was going to affect everyone in the land, from the rich and the powerful, all the way down to the slave girl who is working in the hand mill, everyone, every house would be impacted by this. And also notice at the end of verse five there it says, that all of the firstborn of the cattle, not just the sons would be affected, but even the animals, the flocks, the herds, their lives would be taken as well. The deliverance that God's people receive being spared from this plague, and brought out of the land of Egypt that ultimately becomes a central theme or a central event in their history. For generations. They will look back upon the Passover through the feasts of the Unleavened and bred and partaking in the Passover, they'll remember these events. But it wasn't just in Passover there is a

another requirement that God gives to the people when these firstborn sons would be born. In Exodus chapter 13, and verse 11. It says, When the Lord brings you into the land of the Canaanites, as he swore to you and your father's, and shall give it to you, you shall set apart to the Lord, all that first opens the womb, all the firstborn of your animals that are male shall be the Lord's every firstborn of a donkey, you shall redeem with the lamb. Or, if you will not redeem it, you shall break its neck, every firstborn of man among your sons you shall redeem. He says that you shall set apart to the Lord, all that First, open the womb. And then he says, all the firstborn of your animals shall be the Lord's what does it mean if an animal belongs to the Lord? Well, in in this case, that's means that you offer it as a sacrifice. But when he says that they would give their sons to the Lord, certainly God did not accept human sacrifice. It's one of the reasons why he cast his people off into exile because they had started partaking of these horrible pagan practices. But instead, there would be a substitution for their sons, they would redeem them, they would buy them back, they would pay a price for their firstborn sons. In Numbers, chapter 18, and verse 16, it talks about the payment that was made five shekels of silver that would be brought to the sanctuary after the baby was born. When babies come into the world, there are a lot of things that we have to pay for, you have to pay the doctor, you got to pay the hospital, the insurance, paying for diapers, and clothes, and their food. But what if we were compelled and required to make a payment to the Lord? What if before signing the paper, the discharge papers and being released, you had to give a payment to God, if we saw the child not as something that belongs to me and my family, but instead he is the Lord's? And you can kind of see that with Hannah's attitude when she prays for the child and Samuel is born. After he's weaned, she takes him and she gives him back to God. She understood that that child didn't belong, ultimately to her. We also see with these Israelite boys that they were set apart. In Numbers, chapter 13, verse three, it says, For all the firstborn are mine on the day that I struck down all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, I consecrated for my own all the first born in Israel, both of man and of beasts, they shall be mine, I am the Lord. They were consecrated, they were set apart, they were holy. Notice what he says they're all the first born our mind God had claimed them they belonged to him. That's a powerful thought that the first of everything in their minds belonged to God, their firstborn sons, their first fruits, the first of their flocks, and herds, everything that they possessed of the first fruits they offered, to God, it was dedicated to him. Can you imagine if we viewed our things like that if my first paycheck every year belonged to God, that would take quite a bit of planning, and sacrifice. But that's what they did here. Every time. They were blessed with these possessions, they gave it back to God and in a in a special way the sons were dedicated they were set apart to the Lord. There's an interesting text in the New Testament that I like to look at Hebrews chapter 12. And verse 22, if you're still there, Hebrews 12 And verse 22, that makes reference to the firstborn it says, But you have come to Mount Zion into the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, to an innumerable company of angels, to the General Assembly and the church of the firstborn who are registered in heaven. To God, the Judge of all to the spirits of justman made perfect. The writer here is describing this incredible scene as if we are in the heavenly realms, and we're coming into the presence of God to Mount Zion. He says in verse 23, that there is this General Assembly, he calls it the Church of the First Born.

Conrad Harkrider  14:57
Those who are enrolled in Heaven and have been saved are referred to as firstborn. They are all first born not just the oldest sons of our families, but every person who has put on the Lord Jesus Christ is part of this firstborn assembly. And as we look back at the significance that God's people placed on the firstborn son, and now thinking about all of us having that status, and that title, I think there are a lot of wonderful parallels that we can draw. First of all, note, notice that you are special to God, this distinction, this name, this title, this right shows us that we are special we are treasured. In the eyes of the Lord Ephesians chapter one and verse four, talks about how before God created anything, he put a plan in place before the foundations of the world. He was thinking about us, he put he set everything in order so that one day we could be adopted into His family so that we could be called his children. And again, not just any child in the family, but God gave special significance to the firstborn, though, the ones that would wear his name that would walk in their father's footsteps. They would be the ones that God will look down upon with great pride and joy, the firstborn is special. And you are special to God. My brother and sister in law had decided that they wanted to start having kids. And they thought it would take them a couple of months to get pregnant and months, suddenly turned into years. So they went to see the doctor, and they found out that they weren't going to be able to have children. And I remember the the conversation they had with us when they told us about that they were crushed. As they watched their family members and their friends and people around their age starting their families and realize that that wasn't something that they were going to be able to do. Well, they decided to adopt. And as the process got finalized, they were getting ready to go and pick up the to get the little girl from the hospital, my sister in law started feeling sick. About a week later, she found out that she was pregnant. And now they have two children who are seven months apart, they get a lot of looks going into the grocery store. I remember holding my nephew for the first time and thinking about how many people had prayed for him to come into the world. And thinking about how the doctors had said that it was impossible, it was not going to happen. And yet here he was. Our hearts were is an understatement. bursting with joy. We were so thankful. He's a blessing, a special blessing to our family. Now I want you to think about a mother or a parent or a family who is feeling that way who is longing to have a child and they finally realize that it finally occurs or it happens. Don't you realize that those who have been bought with the blood of Christ, they are like that child. They are like the one that for years they have been God has been hoping and longing and praying that this one would come in to his family. Jesus said that when a sinner repents, and a person turns to God, there is this joy and praise before the throne of God, the angels are rejoicing in His presence. You are significant to God. And what's unfortunate is how many people today feel like they have no worth. And even Christians, we at times can feel like, we don't have a place. I'm too old. I'm too young, I'm not good enough. And we start to devalue ourselves. We think about our imperfections, our weaknesses, our lack of ability, or whatever it may be, but our worth is not based on how good we are, what we've done our talents. But instead we are a treasure to God because of Jesus Christ and through Him and His Spirit He is perfecting and molding us. We are a great treasure to the Lord. As firstborn children of God we also have been given a great inheritance.

Conrad Harkrider  19:53
We have a tremendous inheritance that God has bestowed upon us and a Colossians chapter three To in verse 12, it says, giving thanks to the Father who has qualified you to share in the inheritance of the saints in light. Here, Paul says that we are to give thanks to God because we receive not just physical blessings, not the double portion from mom, and dad. But instead we're in sharing, we're sharing in the inheritance of the saints, the redemption, the forgiveness of sins, we've been delivered from darkness, we now have peace with God, we are fellow heirs with Christ. And we get to share in His eternal blessings. That's what's offered to the children of God. I don't know if you heard but the the Mega Millions jackpot didn't hit on Friday. And that means that it's now the lottery, the the amount is sitting at $1.6 billion, they're going to do a drawing on Tuesday. So you could go out and get a $2 ticket and walk away with 1.6. Bill. Now, your odds of getting that are about one and 300 million, so you have a better chance of getting struck by lightning twice than winning the lottery. But go ahead and try it. But imagine if you had that much money, whatever you wanted, anything you wanted to do any place you wanted to go, you could do it. You would just by all standards be completely rich. What is our definition of wealth of riches, we tend to focus on the bank account, the retirement, the big house, the nice car, the the net worth of an individual. And you know, we spent a lot of time working and pursuing those things. But let me tell you, those aren't true riches. There's a lot of people who have money and wealth and possessions and yet they find themselves poor and miserable spiritually. And the question is, are we placing too much emphasis on the physical and not giving enough attention to the spiritual inheritance that God is offering to us? I say if you want to be rich, if you have Christ, you are rich. You say I want to be well off. If you have the salvation through the Lord, then you are well off we possess something that is more precious than gold or silver or any possession that we could find in this life. In Genesis 25, we're talking about how Esau sold his birthright to his brother Jacob for a bowl of lentil stew. Maybe he should have held out for a ribeye or a fillet? No, it doesn't matter no matter what it would have been. He gave up something that it was so precious, his birthright his inheritance, something that rightfully belongs to him. He looked past it, and gave it up. It's so important for us not to lose sight of what we have been given. And when we're placed in a situation with desire with weakness with temptation that we don't trade our inheritance in for something that is so momentary, something that is so passing. But instead, like Jesus did, where he was faced with the cross faced with persecution and shame, he looked past those things and entrusted himself to God the Father. Jesus kept his focus on the eternal blessings. Because what God is offering far surpasses anything that we could find in this world. Finally, we have this special place in God's eyes, we have been given an inheritance. But ultimately, that means that we belong to Him. God has paid the price for us not with five shekels of silver, not with gold or money or the blood of an animal but with the precious blood of Jesus Christ, He has redeemed us.

Conrad Harkrider  24:42
He purchased us and that means that we belong to Him. Romans chapter 14, in Verse eight says, For if we live we live to the Lord and if we die, we die to the Lord. So then whether we live or whether we die, we are the Lord's and everything that we do. We are the Lord's. What is our focus in this life? What is our goal or aspiration? What are we trying to become? Is our attention is it centered upon career upon family upon some type of recognition or praise or making a name for ourselves being well liked by friends, peers, co workers? What are we ultimately trying to pursue? I think oftentimes, when answering that question, we start with what I want, what I like what I enjoy, instead of remembering who it is that bought us who it is that brought us out of the pit of sin and death, and bailed us out. Because now we belong to the Lord, our life isn't about us. It's not about what I want, we live for the Lord. And practically speaking, what that means is that in every decision that we make, whether it's the job that I choose, the spouse that I marry, the the way that I spend my free time, my hobbies, how I choose to spend my money. Ultimately, we have to ask ourselves, will this bring glory and honor to God? Is this something that is to his praise? Or just to my benefit? One day, we're going to stand before the giver of every good and perfect gift and he's going to ask, how did you use my house? How did you use my car, my money? The children that I gave you, how did you use your time that I blessed you with? God, His has ownership over everything in this world, including our lives. We've been dedicated to him. We're going to close this morning with a song to encourage those who may be here who may be needing prayers or some type of support. God is a Father who is loving towards all of his children. And if there's something that we can do to help you to support you, in your walk with Christ, please come down to the front as we stand and sing
