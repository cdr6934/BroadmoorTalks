You may want to open your Bibles to Jeremiah the first chapter. Where else right, Jeremiah the first chapter. So good to see each and every one of you here tonight we have a good number of present, we have several of you who are visiting with us. We appreciate you taking the opportunity to join us as we worship our God tonight. We hope that our lesson will be of use some value to us as we seek to learn more of Him and His word and learn how to live lives well pleasing Him. So thank you for being with us. Jeremiah, the first chapter and verse one, the text says, and he's opening words to this grand book, The words of Jeremiah, the son of Hilkiah, one of the priests who were in anthos, in the land of Benjamin, to whom the word of the Lord came in the days of Josiah the son of Amman, king of Judah in the 13th year of his reign, it also came in the days that you're hautacam the son of Josiah. But then he is verse three verses we already have two references to the word of the Lord that came to Jeremiah. As we continue reading through the next few verses, verse four, we read again, the word of Lord coming to Jeremiah and verse nine. Lord said he's going to put his words and mouth of Jeremiah and verse 11. Again, the word comes as well as verse 13. So there are six references within these first 13 verses to the word of the Lord that comes to Jeremiah, we might we get the impression that this book has a lot to say about it hasn't been includes a lot of those words, and we would be correct. But this is just the beginning. I was curious about this. So I was wondering what the frequency of the word word was in Scripture, as particularly as it relates here to the study of Jeremiah. And even the standard version, there are 12 140 references to, to either the term word or the plural words in the Bible. And of those 1200 177 of those occur in Jeremiah and half that minion Psalms, Zico and so forth. They may think that's not that significant or not unusual, because the term word, the word word is a fairly common word. We use it to refer not only to the words of God, we also use it to refer to the words of men. And so simply saying that occurs 177 times. And Jeremiah doesn't tell us perhaps a whole lot. So I took the time and effort to just go through all 177 of those occurrences in Jeremiah, and every one of them, except maybe one or two, we first have the word of God, only a couple of occasions out of those 100, same seven times as refer to something other than the Word of God and almost exclusively refers to God's word. I was tempted to go through all 1200 cases and do it in the Bible. But I did not do that. I did kind of quickly scan through those. And by far away the majority of those references throughout the entire scriptures. When the term word is used, that is word of the God that has been spoken of, I would estimate 80 to 90% of the currencies, speaking of God's words, not men's words. In the book of Jeremiah, there are two phrases in particular that you see quite frequently the first that the word of the Lord that came to me or came to Jeremiah, and secondly, where he says here, the word of the Lord. But still, there's something yet even more interesting or continuing to be of interest with regard to this. The fourth expression declares the Lord, that sounds like a pretty common biblical expression, something with the text says, So declares the Lord. Well, nearly half of all those times that that incurs in Scripture occurs within Jeremiah 40%. And equally the expression says, the Lord or the Lord says, is that again, expression that we would think would be fairly frequent throughout all scripture? It is, but a third of all those references occur within Jeremiah, I think we ought to get the impression that the book of Jeremiah perhaps more so than any other book, focuses up focus us up on the words that come from God. One author said that the Word of God is the main actor in the book of Jeremiah, and I think that probably is a good way of summarizing that. There's something else that's interesting about the book of Jeremiah somewhat unique about Jeremiah when it comes to the Word of God. And for this, we need to turn over to Jeremiah, chapter 36. So we'll spend a lot of our time in Jeremiah 36.

Curtis Byers  04:44
Have you ever wonder how the book of Jeremiah or the book of Isaiah, one of the other prophets came to be, you know, we read these books, and we read other things where they say Thus says the Lord and various other things that They do in a result of God's commands. But how did those words ever get committed to writing? How did the books himself ever come about? There's a lot of theories that people suggest about that. But in Jeremiah 36, we have for us a record. And this is a rather unique record. I'll tell you more about that in a minute. But let's read beginning verse one of Jeremiah 36. Let's read the first three verses. There the text says in the fourth year Jehovah come the son of Josiah king of Judah, this word came to Jeremiah from the Lord. Take a scroll and write on it all the words that are spoken to you against Israel and Judah and all the nations. From the day I spoke to you from the days of Josiah until today, it may be that the house of Judah will hear all the disaster that I intend to do to them, so that everyone may turn from his evil way, and that I may forgive their iniquity, and their sin. Now, the fourth year of Jehovah come, was a year 605. And that was a pivotal year in world history as a pivotal year in the history of the people of God in judo. That was the year that Nebuchadnezzar defeated Nico and thus opened up the entire way for the area of Judah to be taken over by Nebuchadnezzar and his Babylonian warriors, that probably had not yet happened. And when this was written, it doesn't seem as if that has happened yet. So it's about to happen. And just on the verge of this time, when Judah is going to become under underneath the heavy hand of Nebuchadnezzar, the Lord appears to Jeremiah, and said, all these words that you have spoken. Now, you might recall that Jeremiah received his call and 627. That's the 13th year of Josiah. So there have been 23 years that Jeremiah had been preaching God's word. And the Lord has tells Jeremiah, all those things that I have told you to say, throughout these years, I want you to take those and write them in a book, right, and put them in to put them in writing. And the purpose is quite plain simple. As Hey, he says, it may be that when people hear the words this book, they may repent, they may want to turn back to Me. And I will be able, therefore to forgive them God's purpose, and given the written word was for people's good to bring about their repentance to bring about their salvation. We might call this the first addition of Jeremiah, we don't know exactly what parts of Jeremiah Jeremiah kind of skips around as you go throughout the book. So it's kind of hard to know when any particular saying was given unless we were told specifically. So I can tell you what chapters of our book of Jeremiah were part of this first edition, but apparently a fairly large section. Because Jeremiah had been preaching for a fairly long period of time. So we might call this the first edition of the book of Jeremiah, but there's more that we're told in this passage that's of interest to us. So thanks. Let's continue reading and verse For Jeremiah 36. It says there then Jeremiah called Baruch, the son of Neerja, and bareroot, wrote on scroll at the dictation of Jeremiah all the words of the Lord that He has spoken to him. And Jeremiah ordered Baruch saying, I am banned from going to the House of Lords, so you are to go, and a day of fasting the hearing of all the people in the Lord's house, you shall read the words of the Lord from the scroll that you have written in my dictation. You shall read them also in the hearing of all the men of Judah who come out of their cities, it may be that their plea for mercy will come before the Lord and that every one will turn from his evil way. For great as the anger and wrath that Our Lord has pronounced against his people, and they route the southern Araya did all that Jeremiah, the prophet ordered him about reading from the scroll the words of the Lord, in the house of the Lord and Lord's house.

Curtis Byers  09:17
We see here a kind of a chain of revelation that goes from God to Jeremiah to Baruch, to the written book and to the people of Judah. God spoke his words to Jeremiah and Jeremiah spoke words to Baruch Brook and turn commit those to writing in a book. And then he took that book and he read it before the people in the Lord's house that were told there in verse six that Jeremiah dictated the words to Baruch. That would have been the typical process that day and time of an author and the pin menu incidence the guy who do the Writing it was common for them to use a secretary. Literacy was not commonplace in the Old Testament times New Testament times either. It's been estimated by several different people. And the usually that's myths come out around 10 to 20% of the people and most were literate and would have the ability to read or write and even writing would probably be even more rare than reading. So it's typical for a person to dictate what he would want to have written to his secretary and Baruch is going to be that Secretary. We're also told that Baruch was going to be necessary and needed because Jeremiah had been banned from going to the Lord's house, apparently, Jehovah already had enough of Jeremiah, he did not want Jeremiah's to have influence. And so he ordered Jeremiah not to come but Baruch could go and brew could take those written words. You know, we have questions, you know, about this chain of Revelation. I have questions about this. You know, we say that with Jeremiah dictated the words to Baruch, what exactly was involved? And Jeremiah recalling all these things that he has said, and in fact, what was involved in Jeremiah receiving those words, that the Lord appear to him and speak to him in a vision they speak to him in dreams? Did he speak to men have a voice Alva cloud, we really don't know. We simply told that the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah. And we're not told, you know, at this point, even at this point in time, and 23 years later, how Jeremiah was able to recall and now some have suggested and cultures such as theirs, where the written word was rare, but the oral word was common, that it had been easy for Jeremiah to recall those things that he would have said over the years, if that would have been a skill that many people would have had in that day, a time that could very well be. You know, I do remember though, when Jesus appeared with his disciples before he went back to heaven, what was one of the benefits of sending the comforter, there's Holy Spirit to the to the apostles. But he Jesus said that their spirit would bring to remembrance all the things that were said. So it was the Holy Spirit involved in this process of Jeremiah remembering, I don't know that the text justice does not say it for that matter. What about Baruch when he took that book and read it that he needed the divine guidance, some kind of divine help? In reading the words, again, the text doesn't say, fellas, let's talk about that a little more. Because there are two passages, familiar passages, but passages which ought to be familiar to us and pastors which we ought to think about and meditate on come to understand it, and hopefully the way that God intended for the passage of Second Timothy 316 through 17, I think it's an important passage. Paul, I'm running to Timothy says, that all scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness, that the man of God may be complete, equipped for every good work. focus upon that first expression, All scripture is breathed out by God.

Curtis Byers  13:12
Other translations, King James, even many modern translations, use the word inspire the scriptures, All scripture are inspired of God. I like this translation better. Inspiration is a breathing in. This is a breathing now, this is an exploration. This isn't the words of God, or the Scripture is breathed out by God. So the result of God's breathing is the word and we can kind of see that right. In this case of Jeremiah, the words started with God. And even though they went first through Jeremiah, and then through Baruch, what was result of God's words being given ultimately, it was the book it was the scroll. And that's what Second Timothy three 316 says that all scripture is breathed out by God. It doesn't answer he doesn't. those question marks for us. This simply tells us the result of what took place, and that seems to be sufficient or ought to be sufficient for us. Another important passage, I think, when we're Second Peter, the first chapter and verse 20. There Peter says, Knowing this, first of all, that no prophecy of Scripture comes from someone's own interpretation. For no prophecy was ever produced by the will of men will a man but men spoke from God, as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit. Here again, we say that there are words that are spoken, that's the prophecy. It is up in scripture there, the prophecy of Scripture, he speaks up. But then he gets there because men are moved by the Holy Spirit. It's kind of interesting isn't the worst Spirit and the Word breadth of the same word. And so it's kind of as if they're moved along by the breath of God. Again, scriptures are breathed out result of God's speaking. The point we need to understand from this important point is that all scripture originates with God. And all scripture is profitable for us just as God was hoping, in Jeremiah's day, as they were to hear the words that were written down, they might would repent. So God hopes that we will result that scriptures will have profit for us as we seek to live lives before him. Something else I would like to point out about this is I find it interesting in the book of Hebrews. Book of Hebrews often refers to Old Testament prophecies refers to passages that have been written down in the past, and how that they have application yet in that day and time, for example, and Hebrews one and six, again, when he brings the he there is God brings the firstborn in the world, he says, Let all the angels worship him that let all with is a is a quotation from an Old Testament passage. But what we're told here is that God said something he says, similarly over to Hebrews, the second chapter, the emphasis not upon God, but upon Jesus and where it says, And Jesus has not called or shame to call them brothers and sister, he says, Jesus says, I will declare your name to my brothers and sisters, again, quoting an Old Testament prophet. And then you go to Hebrews, the third chapter, where the tech says, Therefore, as the Holy Spirit says, Today, if you hear my voice, again, as an Old Testament prophecy, as being quoted were, were said that the Holy Spirit says, Now, I think the first point I would get from these three passages is that we probably ought not to be too picky. And trying to make a distinction between God and Jesus and Holy Spirit, trying to separate who does what, when God's does something, when guys says something, we probably could think it either in terms of God doing or Holy Spirit doing, or Jesus doing it. Because they're all three are obviously involved there, all three are united in the action. There's something even more though I think, value from this passage. Notice that all three of these speaks in the present tense.

Curtis Byers  17:23
God says, Jesus says, The Holy Spirit said, not that they said, past tense, but they are saying, they say this. And what that tells me is that the things that they said, are not things that once upon a time were true, but they're still true. They're not things that Tom's past was a value. Now they're they are still a value. So when you go to Hebrews, the fourth chapter, you'll find a passage like this, where it says the Word of God is living an active, sharper than any two edges serve. So Word is living as a living word, they're not dead letters that were written in some time passed for people of some long ago age, there are words that were written down, that bring life to us, they are living words, they still are able to bring about active results among God's people. And that point is made by some other writers and particularly First Peter, Peter says, and First Peter, the 22nd chapter, something very similar. He says, having purified your souls, by your obedience to the truth. For a sincere brotherly love, love one another earnestly from a pure heart, says he had been born again not of perishable seed, but of imperishable, through the living and abiding word of God. Notice as God's word that is living and continues to abide is still with us today. He goes back a few verses, though, and he makes his point even more explicit, I believe in verses 10 and 12. Listen to what he says, Concerning this salvation. The prophets who prophesied about the grace that was to be years searched and inquired, carefully, inquiring what person or time the Spirit of Christ in them was indicating, when he predicted the sufferings of Christ and the subsequent glories. It was revealed to them that they were serving, not themselves, but you and the things that have been now been announced to you through those who preached the good news to you by the Holy Spirit sent from heaven, things into which angels long to look into. Notice that they understood that they were not serving themselves but they were serving us. The words that were written down in the Old Testament, the words that were written down in Jeremiah, the words that were written down in Isaiah, were written down for our benefit. The truths that were revealed there in are still truths to us today. Those words are still have power. mean for us, and we shouldn't take those words and use them to that benefit.

Curtis Byers  20:10
Let's go back to Jeremiah 36. And I'm gonna summarize a few verses before we read this section and 21 Because there's no that's not the end of the story. We first we read in verses nine through 10. That Baruch did, in fact, take the scroll and he read it in the house of Lord, we told you to read it in the fifth year, the ninth month of fifth year. It was the fourth year when when Jeremiah was told to put these things in writing. So this is probably a year later or so. By time it has actually been written. And they actually go to the Lord's house to read the words. There were several people present that day we read their verse for verse 11. Makayla, in fact, was one of those people there. And he took the he went after he heard the words of Baruch, he went and reported to the various city officials and their gathering place. And they became intrigued by what they heard. And so they sin Jehoiada back to Baruch, and request that Baruch calm and read the scroll to them. And so we read their verses 14 and 15. That Rick does that very thing. He takes a scroll and he goes meet with these officials. And he reads the scroll to them as a group. In verse 16, and following we read where it says that the officials tell Baruch, that they have to report these words to the king Jehovah come as the king but that he and Jeremiah first autohide themselves because they knew how Jehovah como react. They were fearful for Brooks and Jeremiah's life was Jehovah come heard these words. So we're told that the Lord hid Jeremiah and Baruch. And they had to hide i takes the scroll now to the king. So this reading began reading here in verse 21. It says in the king sent you have to hoard it to get the scroll and he took it from the Chamber of flesh among the Secretary and Droid. I read it into the king and all the officials who stood beside the king. There was the ninth month and the king was sitting in the winter house, and there was a fire burning in the firepot before Him as your heart I read three or four columns, the king would cut them off with a knife that throw them into the fire and the fire pot, until the entire scroll was consumed in the fire that was in the firepot. Yet neither the king nor any of his servants who heard all these words was afraid, nor do they tear their garments. Even when l Nathan and Ally Leila and Jamar Jamara urged the king not to burn the scroll, he would not listen to them. I guess Jehovah comm thought that if he could just take these words which were pronouncing judgment upon him and upon the people, and worse was pronouncing that Nebuchadnezzar would soon come and destroy their kingdom. I guess he thought that if he just burned those up, that that's somehow or another would negate, but void, would do away with the prophecies concerning Himself and His people. You know that a lot of people throughout time, have thought that if he can only burn up the words of God, then gods would have no influence. I'm mindful in ancient times of two incidences was that you may have heard about the time of the Maccabees there was a solution ruler named Antiochos epiphanies. His name sounds bad and he was bad. He hated the Jews. He is the one that to try to destroy the Jewish religion. He burned a he offered a swine or pick up on the altar there in the Lord's house in Jerusalem. He desecrated as many things as he could possibly desecrate and he tried to he tried to burn up the scrolls that he could find the words of the Lord in fact, in first Maccabees, the first chapter we have recorded theirs is the book of the law that they found talking about Antiochos epiphanies and his folks, they found they tore to pieces in burned with fire. Anyone found possessing a book of the covenant or anyone who adhere to the law was condemned, condemned to death by decree of the king. He apparently he thought that he could stamp out Judaism by trying to threaten people not to read the book of the law. And he like his epiphany is wasn't successful the Maccabees were vaulted and they were able to gain their independence for a period of time. And the Roman era,

Curtis Byers  25:07
Diocletian, who was a Roman emperor, in the latter part of the third century, and early part of the fourth century, he was the he was the emperor right before Constantine, he issued an edict that was called indica 303, that churches be burned and the descriptors be destroyed with fire. And then if anyone did not give up their copies of the scripture, that they too, we'd be burned. Diocletian has interesting character, we're told that his wife was actually a Christian. So we don't know for sure how, how sincere he was and his efforts to stamp out Christianity. He has some cold emperors with him that probably were more zealous than he was. But anyway, they made the attempt but they didn't get they did not succeed. A Constantine, who came to the throne falling in that and with Constantine came the lawful worship of Christianity in modern times has also been people who have thought they could stamp out Christianity by stamping out the Bible. Particularly I'm thinking of the communist countries. The Soviet Union under Stalin under Shibi. Under Lenin and then Stalin efforts were made to destroy religion. I couldn't find exist explicit statements where they burned scriptures. They thought that they couldn't get rid of Christianity through re education of the young people. And they were quite successful religion suffered miserably in communist Russia. But in Mao's China, when Mao became the leader of the Communist Party in China, he actively sought to burn copies of the Scripture. And even more aggressively North Korea has has made it a point to try to actively persecute, imprison and kill Christians who are found reading the Bible. There's a telling statistic, I'm told. That of all the detractors or defectors excuse me all the effectors who have been able to get out of North Korea, only 4% report every ever seen a Bible inside of North Korea. They continue to persecute Christians in that country. Now all SOS attempts fail. Jehovah can fail to because we go back to Jeremiah 36. We read there and verses 27 and 28th. That now after the king had burned the scroll with the words that Baruch wrote, A Jeremiah is dictation, that the word of the Lord came to Jeremiah. Take another scroll and write on it all the former words that were in the first row with Jehovah and the king of Judah has burned. They might call this the second edition of Jeremiah. Jeremiah still live Jeremiah Casteel, rewrite through with Brooks help the words again and we're told that many other words were added beside. Now I don't know I have a presumably we have the final edition, Jeremiah in our hands. I say presumably because the Septuagint is somewhat different than the Hebrew that a copy that we are translations are based upon. But this is the final edition. How many other intermediate editions were there? Before we get to the final edition, I'm not quite sure. But it is interesting that in the book of Jeremiah, we are told of several smaller writings that Jeremiah did, all of which are included within our book, but they were individual compositions at the time. So in Jeremiah 36, we read of the first and second editions. If you go to Jeremiah, chapter 29, we read there the letter that Jeremiah wrote, In the days was at a time, he wrote to the captus, who are had already been taken to Babylon. This was the letter where he tells them to remain in the land to work hard to understand that they're going to be there for so many years, that their prosperity dependent upon the governance prosperity, so they were to be supporters of the governing powers. They're in Babylon. That letter Jeremiah wrote and we have a copy of it is Jeremiah chapter 29. And chapter 30, we tell we're told again there in verse two where God tells Jeremiah to write in a book, all the words of the things that he intends to do for them in the future, and inverted in chapters 30 and 31 and 32 to some extent, and 33. We have recorded the promises of God, about his restoring Israel, those things were first to be written into a book.

Curtis Byers  30:05
In Jeremiah, chapter 51, Jeremiah, the latter part of 51, he is told to write down all the prophecies that the Lord had given him concerning the kingdom of Babylon, and all the things that God was going to do to Babylon. And that book was to be sent to the captus, in Babylon, in fact, even to be read to the Babylonian officials. So we have that book that was written. And we get the 51 wishes, the next to last chapter with only 52 chapters in Jeremiah, the very last first there, and 64 says thus far are the words of Jeremiah. Because when you get to chapter 52, the last chapter in Jeremiah, the words we have, they're essentially a verbatim copy, a duplicate of what we find in Second Kings, 24 and 25, which is the very last words of the book of Second Kings. So I don't know. I mean, I think what we are to understand from this, is that the book of Jeremiah itself took a long time for it to be written. Jeremiah prays for 40 years. And it was as he continued to write down and God's instruction, he wrote more and more the book and ultimately ends in a in a format, somehow the way we have it. But the point is, whose words are these? These are God's words that were given through God's prophet that were written down through that prophets instruction, so that we might have them today. There are words that were given to us. You know, as we reflect upon this period of time, there was another written word that had a great impact within the times of Jeremiah, you know, we're in Second Kings, the 22nd chapter, Second Kings, a 22nd Chapter. We read, there were kya. As he was cleaning out the temple, he came across the Book of the Law, somehow or another the book of law had been misplaced, or had been hidden, has somehow been lost. And when he found the book of the law, he sent it by the hands of shape and I believe, to Josiah and shape and read the words within the book of the law to Josiah. And what was the what was the, what does the text say, in terms of Jeremiah's response? First we read of this personal response, he wept and he rep who he rent his clothes, he tore his clothes because he understood that the words that were spoken by God were not being followed by him or by the people. And then secondly, that that motivated him to instigate a national reformation. And he went throughout the land, destroying the various places of idolatrous worship, trying to bring people back in into the correct worship of God. He reinstituted the Passover and other things that they read there. Within the book, the law, no reformations, reformations are fueled by the written word of God. I've always been impressed with the efforts of some in early days of the Reformation in Europe, those men who who were under the Roman Catholic system, and who saw the errors there in in sought to bring people out. The most successful part of those efforts, though, were centered around making the Word of God available in the language of the people. So we read of John Wycliffe, for example. His name is associated with a variety of English translations that were made from the Vulgate that appeared in the 1380s up to 1400 variables. This was before the printing press. And, you know, for a long time, the Scriptures, the Vulgate, had been around for 1000 years and the wishes of Latin translation that would be used by the Roman Catholic Church. But the people in Europe had lost the ability to read and, and speak Latin, it was becoming a dead language, even in that day and time. So the only people who had access to the Word of God were those who could read and speak Latin, which basically meant those who were within the priesthood of the Roman Catholic Church. Well, John Wycliffe

Curtis Byers  34:47
translated the Bible into English of his day. And he became such a critic of the Roman Catholic Church, and his criticisms took root because people for the first time to read in their own language, what God has said. And they can read what God has said, and compared it to what the Roman Catholic Church was teaching. And they because they could see that errors of the way. Martin Luther, who lived after the printing press was 1520. As about the time and when he he also as part of his rough reforming efforts. He translated the Greek New Testament into German. For the first time, the German people had a translation in their own language. And I'm told by those who knows the Reformation better than I do that probably this was his most important work. In his efforts to reform the Roman Catholic Church was by translating the Bible into German, again, the people throughout a large section of Europe, to read and study for themselves to see what God wanted them to know and how to be, and can see the errors that were abundant within the Roman Catholic Church. When did William Tyndale lived at same time as Martin Luther, he was inspired by Luther, and he translated the Greek into the English first time, an English translation been based upon the Greek New Testament. Luther would have been killed if there if the Roman Catholics could have gotten their hands on him, but he was protected by some mighty German princess Prince. William Tyndale was not quite so fortunate. He was burned at the stake for having the audacity to put the words of God in a language that people could read for themselves. So it's interesting how that both the any reformation effort as well as any resistance to the word to religion is both centered around the word of God. To me, that suggests that there is in some way or another, a superiority of the written word to the spoken word that is like to make three points and then less will be yours. First of all, there's a certain permanence associated with the written word. Jehovah wasn't able to destroy it. And he aka Tiffany's wasn't able to destroy it. Mao has not been able to destroy it. It continues. And I suspect as long as there are people who are anxious to know what God's word is, there will be people who will find ways to preserve with God's help his word, it will continue as long as earth continues. Jeremiah was a powerful speaker, I'm sure, he was, no doubt a powerful preacher. But his voice was ultimately stilled by his death. But the words that he wrote, God's words that he wrote, continues to have an impact upon us, they're still living words, they still abide forever. There's a certain permanence associated with his word that gives benefit even today. The written word can be distributed widely. Now I find interesting going back to the timeframe of Jeremiah, Daniel was one of those captains who was taken to the land of Babylon. And we have the words of Daniel recorded for as well. And if you go to nine chapter of Daniel, There we read, we're in verse two, Daniel recalls, from his reading of the books, that Jeremiah said that the captivity would last 70 years. He refers to books and the plural. What books would those have been? Well, I suspect, first of all, the letter in Jeremiah 29, that was written to the captus there in Babylon. That letter mentioned that they were to be there for 70 years. And I was suspect also that he had a copy of the book of Jeremiah which in other places also we've mentioned that the death of prophecy that the the in captivity was gonna last several years. But Daniel, 70 years after probably the death of or at least, say 60 years after the death of Jeremiah, and 1000s of miles away, still had access to those words at Jeremiah spoke.

Curtis Byers  39:40
A written word can be taken widely, broadly. They transcend place, they transcend time. And thirdly, I would suggest that there's a certain clarity of expression that's associated with the written word that may not be associated with the spoken word. Are, we do have a benefit. I think when we hear when we're speaking face to face with somebody, we have the benefit, perhaps, of kind of seeing their body language. And maybe the body language kind of helps communicate as well, the message. But that also can be misunderstood right body languages can be misunderstood. So I'm not so sure that the written word isn't, isn't clear in a lot of ways. In fact, I'm kind of reminded of Paul's words over Ephesians, the third chapter, where he says how the mystery was made known to him by him to me by revelation, as I have written briefly, when you read this, you can perceive my insight into the mystery of Christ. Paul's expectation was, that when they read what he wrote, they will have the same understanding that he had. And I will suggest, that when we read what Jeremiah wrote, or what Isaiah wrote, or what Daniel wrote, or for, for any biblical writer, that we can come to the same understanding that they had into the wonderful mysteries of God. You know, there are those who would attempt to distort scripture, there are those who would attempt to twist scriptures, to some advantage for themselves. But because we have the written word in our possession, they can be called to account. We can open God's word to compare to the things that any person says, they guess what the language of Scripture says, and make a judgment as to whether or not they're speaking truth, or speaking error. The written word of God is a blessing beyond measure. In it, we can know the mind of God. In it, we have the very breath of God in our hands. These are the words that God wanted to give us a great effort and a great price. You know, there is, you know, Baruch, we have already in our study have mentioned how the Jeremiah suffered persecution brought to came under fire, came under persecution, because of the of his association with Jeremiah. At the very beginning of the book of Jeremiah, there were there were the words of comfort that God gave to Jeremiah. When he told Jeremiah, he said that, that he would, he would fortify him that he would protect him. Well, the Lord made the same promise to Baruch. That he made the Jeremiah and I didn't write that passage down. I'm gonna recall right now where it is in the book of Jeremiah. Thanks, Ron, Jeremiah 44. I can't recall right now. But he make a Baruch, the exact same assurance that he gave the Jeremiah that he would protect him. But that protection still did not take away the great danger, the tribulations, the sufferings that they had to endure, to put God's writing into words. And people throughout time have made great effort and many of us offer their lives that these words can become commonplace, that these words can be shared and kept and maintained. And we ought to give God the glory in the praise for having the scriptures of all our possessions. Surely the scriptures are our greatest possession? Because only in the scriptures, who we know what God wills and your wishes for us, there may be those here this evening, who in some way could use our assistance, either they want to respond to the gospel of Christ in obedience or want to make something in your life what right at this time, I would encourage you to open your song books to the song that's been announced and let's fall on the screen and unless encourage one another this week, and every week as we seek to study God's Word, that we may come to know Him, that we may be the people that he would have us to be for subject invitation, please come this time.
