Surely this type of worship that we've engaged in this morning and gathering around the Lord's table, stirs our deepest emotions appreciate the songs that Nick left for us this morning as we want to do exactly what this song tells us to do, which is to be hold our God to think about him to fix our gaze upon Him. God created us to worship Him to praise him to honor him. And that's exactly what we have been doing this morning. And Isaiah chapter 40, Isaiah is warning the nation of Judah of an impending judgment because of their sinfulness and the rebellion. And he is going to describe a punishment that is horrific, beyond comprehension, that they are going to experience it would be very devastating, they think they would reach a point of hopelessness. But in Isaiah chapter 14, verse, verse nine, he understatement to the people of Israel, behold your god, oh, Israel, and basically offering them hope to rise above their trials and the the pain of the suffering that they are experiencing. I like the the statement from Ray ortlund Jr, who said this, that Isaiah shows us God, through God's eyes. If we see God through our own eyes, we diminish him without meaning to or even realizing it. But if we see God through God's eyes, it changes everything else. And I think that that's exactly right. So this morning, I want us to think about this statement in Isaiah chapter 40, which again, is the title of my lesson. But it's the challenge that I want us to think about. We talked about this in our study Thursday night at our house, and I want to expand on that this morning. But Isaiah gives a powerful message to people in despondency, perhaps despair, and hopelessness, he tells them to behold their God. And so that's what we want to do this morning. As we look at the scriptures, if you've got your Bibles open, you might go ahead and kind of camp at Isaiah chapter 40. We'll be looking at that passage. I've got most of these scriptures on the screen, but you might want to read along in your Bible as well. But in Isaiah chapter 40, notice that this text and I went ahead and put this up on the screen. And again, this is going to be the message of encouragement to a people of Judah facing captivity facing the consequences of their sins. And again, there may be at the end of the rope. And so God says, speaking through Isaiah says this, go up on a high mountain, oh Zion, herald of good news. Lift up your voice with strength, oh, Jerusalem, herald of good news, lifted up, fear not say to the cities of Judah, behold your God. Behold, the Lord God comes with might and His arm rules for him. Behold, his reward is with him and his recompense before him. When I suggest to you this morning at the outset of lesson I've got three main points that I want us to focus on from this context. But I want to suggest to you that this statement is truth. And if you don't learn anything else from the lesson learned this when this truth Behold, your God answers the that is the key of life that answers every question that we face. Beholding God is the cure, as One writer says, For all that ails us. This is not an overstatement. Beholding God is the fundamental act action that each of us needs to engage in, as we seek to rise above our difficulty. So beholding God will give us perseverance to run the spiritual race and to the end, beholding God, beholding Your God will enable you to bear up under the most difficult suffering and pain imaginable. This truth, brethren, is worth more than a million dollars, it's worth more than all the diamonds in Africa. Beholding God will solve every trial, every problem in your life. So the question is, how do we do that?

Mike Roy  04:21
We'll talk about that this morning. It's no wonder, I think that the Hebrew writer tells us to fix our eyes on Jesus. He does have the answers for every question you wrestle with. He has the answer to the biggest problem, we wrestle with the sin problem. And so at the beginning of this chapter, Isaiah is shouting out this life changing message to his brethren and to us. He's telling them behold your God, He is great. He is awesome. He is powerful. His reward and his punishment are with him. He is worthy of all praise and ultimately, as we behold our God we should learn to trust As Tim, He is powerful he is awesome is there isn't really, because I've thought about this and last few days, I don't think there's any words that can be formulated in human language that adequately, adequately described God's greatness. Now you try over the next several days, weeks and months and see if you can come up with it. But there aren't any words to describe his greatness is so staggering. We just keep using adjectives, and then he's very great. He's powerfully great. And so that's what Isaiah is telling the people of Judah to do, to really turn their eyes on Jesus, as we sometimes sing, look fool in his wonderful face. And the things of birth will grow strangely dim in the light of His glory, and grace. And so let's look at this passage this morning. And look at some lessons that God is trying to teach us want to as we kind of survey the chapter, and we raised the question, what does it mean, when we behold God? What do we see when we behold God? What we see a loving, compassionate Shepherd, we see a God of incomparable greatness. And we see a sovereign ruler and a creator of all the universe. I'm going to go into more detail as we get into the lesson. But these are really the main things that I think we see, when we come to Isaiah chapter 14, this is what Isaiah is hoping that his audience is going to hear that when he tells them to behold your god, oh, Israel, this is what he wants them to know why because ultimately, he is able to deliver the he is able to bring us through the trials that temptations to burdens, the fears, the failures, that that haunt every one of us. And so this, I think, is what Isaiah is, is conveying to, to God's people. So let's think first of all, and we'll go ahead and be looking at this, this context over here. Isaiah shows us God is a tender, compassionate Shepherd, I want to put this on the screen. You can look at that in your Bible. We just read that on the screen up to verse 10. But this would, verse 11, says, what Isaiah is trying to get Israel to think about to see, it says that he will tempt his flock like a shepherd. This is the ESB, He will gather the lambs in his arms, he will carry them in his bosom, and gently lead those that are with young. So as Isaiah talks about the greatness, the staggering greatness of God, the first lesson, the first image he's trying to paint before our eyes, is if this awesome, powerful, Eternal God, that is indescribable.

Mike Roy  07:58
Is a caring Shepherd, who loves you, who loves me who knows my weaknesses, and knows your weaknesses as well. And so it begins with that image that God that Isaiah showing us God as a tender, compassionate Shepherd, who could attend his walk, he's gonna gather the lambs in his arms, that's us. He's going to gather the sheep into his arms, carry them in his bosom, and gently lead those who are with young. And so when you think about God is a shepherd, what's one of the basic qualities of a shepherd, there's probably a lot of them. But one of the basic and fundamental qualities of a shepherd is goodness. God is good. He loves his people, he provides for people. And so I think that's what Isaiah is shouting to the people of Israel to Judah, Behold, your God, he is infinitely good. He loves his people. The first 39 chapters of Isaiah, show us a God who is faithful to punish his people for breaking his covenant. We've been talking about that on Sunday mornings. But in chapter 40, we see a God who is faithful to forgive and restore his people, when they turn in penitence, and, and seek His mercy because God is a compassionate Shepherd, one of the passages that illustrates that very clearly. In Exodus chapter 34, when God had Moses remake the two tablets of stone that He shattered, and God had to rewrite them, and God passed by Moses, in the previous chapter with his back but look at in verse six. And this is the message that God has given to Moses with the rewriting of remaking these two tablets. Then the Lord passed by in front of him, and proclaim the Lord the Lord God, compassionate and gracious, slow to anger, and abounding in loving kindness and truth who keeps loving kindness for 1000s, who forgives iniquity a transgression and sin yet, he will by no means leave the guilty and punished. But look at all the statements made about God's grace. He is compassionate. He's gracious. He's slow to anger, abounding in loving kindness and truth. He keeps loving kindness per 1000, forgives iniquity, forgives transgression and sin. This is the God whom we serve. And so you think about this language that we just looked at in verse 11, that God is like a shepherd, He will gather his lambs, in carry them in his bosom is one rider. I think it's noteworthy to think about this, that God carries his people. We don't carry God with our good deeds, but he carries us on the back of his son. We saying this morning before the Lord's Supper from a scripture from Isaiah, chapter 53, verse six, all of us like sheep have gone astray, we have turned everyone to his own way. And the Lord has laid on him on Jesus the iniquity of a Saul. And so Isaiah wants to troubled exiles of Judah, to behold their God and understand. So when we think about God, in terms of his character, he is a shepherd, and the ultimate expression of God's tenderness and, and compassion is Jesus Christ who was described as the Good Shepherd. So God is a shepherd. And Jesus comes on the scene in the New Testament. In John chapter 10, verse 14, it says, I am the good shepherd. And I know my own than my own know me, even as the Father knows me, and I know the Father, I lay down my life for the sheep. So the first image that we see in Isaiah chapter 40, that Isaiah is setting before the people of God is that God are awesome. God is a caring, loving, tender Shepherd, we don't ever need to underestimate God's mercy and grace, we do understand that he does punish sin, he does punish rebellion. But all but when we think about his character, we see him as one who is extremely compassionate and tender like a shepherd. The second picture that we see in the book of Isaiah chapter 40, is that Isaiah shows us a God of incomparable greatness and power. The first few verses that we'll look at are in relation to his creation.

Mike Roy  12:27
So look at with me in verses 12 through 14, is again, think about this God's Isaiah is trying to encourage God's people, Judah in particular, think Israel, maybe in general, but trying to encourage them to persevere, to lift up their eyes, and to be hold God in the midst of the burden in the midst of their anguish, and suffering, and famine and all that type of thing. So now, he uses illustrations that will show to hopefully encourage them. So in verse 12, he said, Who has measured the waters in the hollow of his hand and marked off the heavens by the span, and calculated dust of the earth by the measure, in weighed the mountains in a balance in the hills and a pair of scales? We don't have time to look at all these images. But I want you to think about this for just a moment, we'll just have to keep focused on a few of these. What is the hollow of your hand, isn't it this area right here, if you put your hand together, that's the hollow of my hand, who has measured all of the water on Earth, every stream, every river, every lake, every ocean, every sea, and put it in his hand? Nobody, nobody can do that. But God takes all he can take all the water on Earth, and put it in the hollow of his hand. I think I can trust him. I think I can trust him to give me water. If I'm thirsty. I think I can trust him to meet my needs. I get overwhelmed with fear and failure and defeat and difficulties that we face and burdens and grief and all that kind of stuff. But that's what Isaiah saying, Who else can do this? Nobody can do this. But God can take all the water on Earth, among other things, and hold them in the palm of his hand as we just sang that song, who has held the oceans in his hand? Who has numbered every grain of sand. You don't have a scientific calculator that's big enough for that. But God can do that. Just reminder that God is bigger than his creation. Have you ever thought about that? That God is bigger than his creation? He certainly is. And as we think about a song that he listened to in the 70s going up, he's got the whole world. In his hand. God really does have the whole world in his hand. Go on to the next. Let me go put this up here for a second. So as we focus on God's incomparable greatness, we see it in four ways in this chapter. We just talked about His Creation versus Verse 12, we'll see that God is greater than the nation that the nations the powerful nations, like Babylon and Assyria don't compare with God's greatness. Idols don't compare with him. And rulers don't compare with him. So notice in verse I think I've got this excuse me, look at verses 13 and 14, as we we focus on really under the first category that God is greater than his creation. In verse 13. Isaiah says, Who has directed the Spirit of the Lord, or as his counselor has informed him, with whom did he consult and who gave him understanding, and who taught him in the path of justice and taught him knowledge and informed him of the way of understanding? So you look at, again, these verses of 13 and 14, and we realize that God is his own counselor, that he has all knowledge, all wisdom, all understanding, and nobody can, nobody can offer God anything. He is the one who possesses all knowledge. So again, in terms of understanding and wisdom and knowledge, God has all of that we from time to time, seek counsel from one another from others if we need some help and in different ways, but God does not need any of that. So look at the as we continue to look at this section, we see that this his creation doesn't compare it to him, the nations don't compare to him look at I put these on the screen. For convenience sake, Isaiah chapter 40 versus 5015 through 17. And let me check my notes here just for a moment.

Mike Roy  16:53
Yes, so he said in verse 15, Behold, the nations he talked about the powerful nations to nations are like a drop from a bucket and are counted as dust on the scales Behold, he takes up the coastlines like buying dust, Lebanon would not suffice for fuel nor or is beast enough for a burn offering. All the nations are as nothing before him, they are accounted by him as less than nothing and emptiness, lots of things that you could talk about there. He said, the nations are like a drop from a bucket. You think about a bucket of water, like a gallon bucket of water? How many drops of water in are in a bucket of water? If you carry that gallon bucket, which may have I'm gonna say 100,000 drops of water, and you spill one drop? Would it be missed? No. What did you say about the nation's he said that the nations are even less significant than a drop above a drop of water from a bucket, so to speak. And so in this context, he's telling us that the most powerful nation in history, if he may be might be thinking about the Syria, or babblin. But the most powerful nation in history, in comparison to God is less than a drop of water. You got to think about that. And he's not talking about one nation. He's not even talking about all the ancient nations. He's saying that all nations of human history past, present and future are less than a drop of water in comparison to God. Do we understand God's greatness? I'm not sure that we really do. And so in the context of the suffering of God's people in captivity, and maybe the fear that they fail from these intimidating rulers, he's telling them we don't have to fear the kings of the earth, the rules of the Earth, the presidents, the Queen's gods, the ruler that we fear. And so, again, it's so many lessons that we can learn from there go on to look at the the comparison of an idol. So in verses 18 through 20, Isaiah continues to challenge the people of Israel, the nation of Judah in particular, to think about God's great greatness in comparison to idols. He said, To whom then will you liking God? Or what likeness will you compare with him as for the idol, a craftsman casted a goldsmith place it with gold and a silver Smith fascist chains of silver. He who is too impoverished for such an offering selects a tree that does not rot. He seeks out for himself a skillful craftsman to prepare an idol that will not taught her lots of stuff in there, but again, making the point over here in Israel's history, and their downfall was really preceded because of their love for idolatry. They bowed down to every image imaginable, stone, rock, brick, gold, whatever it might be all types of idols that they thought were so powerful. You know, we very often ridicule ancient Israel for their idolatry and how they bow down to all these I goes, but we struggle to keep idols out of our own heart, pride, lust, greed, there's the list goes on and on. But I think, brethren, that perhaps one of the greatest idols that we as New Testament Christians may wrestle with is a secular mindset is worldly mindedness. We don't want to be different from the world. Why do we see Christians going back into the world, leaving God's word leaving their families leaving the Lord's people, it's the pull of a secular culture, it becomes a major idol. So we think about Israel bowing down to all those stupid brick images and rock images. And how different sometimes are we in our own lives? Let's look at another comparison over here. So So Isaiah is trying to get Israel to see God's greatness in comparison to things that seemed to be very great, this would be another one of them.

Mike Roy  21:00
The kings, the rulers of the earth. So in verse 21, he said, Do you not know Do you not here has an often told you from the beginning, Have you not understood from the foundations of the earth? It is He Who sits above the circle of the earth, and its inhabitants. inhabitants are like grasshoppers, who stretches out the heavens like the curtain and spreads them like attempt to dwell in who brings princes to nothing, and makes the rulers of the earth as emptiness. Scarcely are they planted scarcely sown, scarcely has their STEM taken root in the earth. When he blows on them, these rulers, they wither, and the tempest carries them off like stubble. So in the eyes of Judah, or Israel, the kings of Assyria or Babylon or Persia, whatever it might be, they seem so vontade so powerful, and God's speaking through Isaiah telling them that they don't compare to God in any way possible. So we raised the question, excuse me, raise a question where and Isaiah is really asking these the God's people? Where are the powerful ancient kings of the world? Think about we can make this application where is Alexander the Great, or the pharaohs? Or the Caesars? Where's Ganga is Khan. But where's Napoleon? Where is King Tut, the boyhood Egypt, the Egyptian boy who had king who died at a young age who was buried, I am told and tons of gold. Where are these kings? They are dead. Isaiah says, all kings of the earth will die. They either are dead, or they will be dead. But behold, our God is we sometimes see he is alive. That's the difference between the God we serve in the kings of this earth. So again, is we think about our culture, if we're not happy, who is the president? Who is the present president or governor, or whatever the case might be? We don't need to be overly concerned about that, because God's still rules from heaven. And that's what he's trying to get his people to understand. As you go ahead then and look at the third point I want us to focus on this morning, is we look at Isaiah chapter 40, where God where Isaiah is giving, trying to give encouragement to these people who are almost at a point of maybe hopelessness when they see the condition of their captivity. Think about the famine, the hunger is just horrific. But But Isaiah shows us God is a sovereign creator. Look at verses 25 and 26. Again, notice how often this phrase comes up over here. He says, To whom then will you like me? That's a rhetorical question. Can you like in God to anyone or anything? The answer is no. He's not comparable to anything in all his creation. He said, To whom then will you like me that I would be his sequel says the Holy One, lift up your eyes on high and see who has created the stars, the one who leaves forth their host by number, he calls them all by name, because of the greatness of His might and the strength of his power, not one of them is missing. And so when it says who then to whom then will you like me? This is a summary statement. Basically, stating emphatically that God has no equal there's no buddy like and nothing in his creation compares to God began in He invites us to scan the horizon to gaze into the heavens, and ask that question, who made all these things? And just again, just one point that we can bring out from this one not to bring up from this text. Excuse me. When you look up into the sky at night, and I've been noticing that a lot if I take our little dog out late at night early in the morning, which is kind of an ongoing You think I look at the stars up in the sky? And God's saying through Isaiah, do you know how many stars there are up in the heavens? I did a little research, I heard that there's about 5000 that are visible. And then the more research I did, I'm told that there are billions, billions of stars. You can't even see. God can take care of you. God can meet our needs. Right? And that the point that he's making over here, again, we, in addition to that, in verse 26, when he tells us to look up at the sky and see the stars, not only other, innumerable stars, all created, to radiate and reflect God's glory. What else did God do about all those stars? In the text?

Mike Roy  26:01
He named them? Do we know how awesome our God is? This a real question. He is powerful, beyond anything that our minds can imagine, but he's also gracious and merciful to us. And so the point I make is we bring our lesson to a close this morning, that when trials seem to be almost overwhelming, behold your God, when pain seems almost unbearable, behold your God, when temptation seemed too powerful and relentless, behold your God, when grief seems unbearable, Behold, your God. God is bigger than all of our difficulties combined. And I like the song that the kids saying, sometimes my God is so big, so strong and so mighty. There's nothing that my God cannot do. I think we need to listen to the kids, and listen to what they teach us. And so the conclusion is you look at this chapter. And there's really there's a complaint verse 27, then God's response to verse 28. And following verse 27. Jude is complaining that God doesn't see what's going on in verse 27. Why do you say Oh, Jacob and assert Oh issue on my way is hidden from the Lord. And the Justice do me escapes the notice of God? Does God really not know what's going on in it with his people in Babylonian captivity, does not know what's going on when the Assyrians overtook Israel and put them in captivity? Does God not know what's going on in your life? We just said he, the stars, the rain, everything is its income. He's incomparable in his greatness. And so God's response here in verse 28, says this, do you not know Have you not heard the everlasting God the Lord, the Creator of the ends of the earth does not become weary or tired. His understanding is is inscrutable, he gives strength to the weary. And to him who lacks might he increases power, though youth grow weary and tired. That describes a lot of us. Even if we're not youth, youthful, and vigorous, young men stumbled badly, levers 31. Yet those who wait for the Lord will gain new strength, they will mount up with wings like eagles, they will run and not get tired, they will walk and not become weary. And what I want to say and really conclusion this morning, I think this is the bottom line those who Behold God are those who wait for him. That's the answer. I know. That's what not what you want to hear. I want instant results. I want instant deliverance from my pain. But those who Behold God are those who patiently trust in Him. They wait on His grace and His mercy. They understand that God, this incomparable, the great God is a compassionate Shepherd. They wait on God because he because nothing is creation compares to him, the nations the idols, the rulers of this earth do not compare to God's greatness at all. And they wait on God because he's a sovereign creator of heaven and earth. And he is able to deliver each of us from our trials and our temptations. And so the message I leave with you this morning is simply the statement that Isaiah gave to the people of Judah way back when, when they're in the in the pit of despair and despondency and there's no hope. When your face is on the ground and you're you don't even know where to turn, just look up and behold your God. And so that really is the key for us as we serve God. Do we need help? Do you need help in dealing with your trials, difficulties and pain and in navy, sometimes unanswered prayer. Doesn't God know about that? Yes, he does, he knows what's going on in your life. He made you. He loves you. He sent His Son to the cross, to suffer and die for your sins so he knows about your needs. And he's able to meet all those needs. It may be that you're here this morning you've never obeyed the gospel of Christ. If you want to have the comfort of a loving Shepherd meeting your every need, then you have to make Jesus the Lord and Savior of your life. You do that through faith in Jesus Christ who will lead us to repent of your sins, and a willingness to confess your faith in him and then you have to be baptized into Christ. That's how you become a child of God. Once you do that, you become his child. If there are any here this morning who needs to respond in any way to the invitation we invite you to come while we stand and sing this invitation song
