Good morning, if you have your Bibles and want to be opening up to Romans, the 12th chapter, Romans chapter 12. It's good to be together so grateful for all the visitors that we have that have come to be with us to worship, appreciate so much what Mike said before we took the Lord separate together just to reflect on that great passage from Psalm 51.

Conrad Harkrider  00:38
There are a lot of sports out there that require a very specific set of skills. You're probably aware that athletes trained for months and years and years in order to develop these skills to be able to compete and whatever sport that they're playing in. But have you ever thought about what is the most difficult sport to play? That is what sport demands the most out of its athletes, both physically and mentally. ESPN actually published a list. And they went and looked at sports around the world. And they compiled a list of 60 different sports. And they did research they looked at things like strength, endurance, power, speed, agility, hand eye coordination, and they came up with a list of the most difficult sport in the world. Now, you might be surprised that fishing and bowling were not in the top 10. But the one that did rise to the top that was that was voted as the hardest sport ranked by the degree of difficulty was boxing. Now that that might not have been my number one pick, but it makes sense when you start to think about it. Boxing is physically demanding. The the conditioning and the strength training that an athlete has to go through in order to get themselves ready to get in the ring is is pretty intense. But it's not just the physical nature of the sport. But there's also a lot of technique. And what makes learning that technique difficult is that many of the motions in boxing are very unnatural. So I'm not a boxer. But from what I've read the as you're learning the techniques, you have to remember to do things that don't come naturally to you. So instead of keeping your feet together, your feet have to stay wide, you got to shuffle from left to right. When someone is coming towards you, or or attacking you, you can't jump out of the way which might be a natural instinct, but you have to stand your ground keep your feet in place. In boxing, you have to train your mind and your body to do something that is unnatural at first. But after countless hours of practice, that movement becomes seamless, it becomes fluid in our service to Christ. God calls us to live in a way that is different from the world. It's different from how we used to live, it's different than maybe how we were raised, or the way that we thought before we came to Christ. And in many ways, this life in Christ is not something that comes naturally to us. We have to fight against desires, impulses, ways of thinking that we might previously have had. And we find ourselves going against the grain. When we live in a way that is imitating Christ. We are living in a counter cultural manner. And so this morning, I want us to think about this idea of living in a way that is unnatural. It goes against the grain and see what Paul has to say in Romans chapter 12. And to remember that these things are not easy. They require a great deal of practice. They require patience. They require a constant determination and commitment to follow what God has said. So let's read together from Romans chapter 12, beginning of verse 14, Romans 12 And verse 14. It says, Bless those who persecute you. Bless and do not curse them. Rejoice with those who rejoice. Weep with those who weep. Live in harmony with one another. Do not be haughty, but associate with the lowly never be watching In your own sight, repay no one evil for evil, but give thought to do what is honorable in the sight of all, if possible, so far as it depends on you live peaceably with all. Beloved, never avenge yourselves, but leave it to the wrath of God for it is written, VENGEANCE IS MINE, I WILL REPAY, says the Lord. To the contrary, if your enemy is hungry, feed him, if he is thirsty, give him something to drink. For by so doing you will heap burning coals on his head, Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good.

In Romans 12, Paul goes through and gives a number of instructions that relate to our relationships with other Christians. In verse five, he talks about how there are many members in the body of Christ, and how we are individually members of one another, how we affect each other, how if one one member is suffering, that all will suffer together, and how we can have an impact on each other. He talks about the various gifts that God has given to the body. In verse 13, he says that we need to remember to contribute to the needs of the saints to practice hospitality, if there's a brother or sister that is in need of food or clothing or a place to stay, then we should do what we can to try to help that person to meet that need. It's vital that we have the proper attitude and action toward one another. But hearing verses 14 through 21, there seems to be a shift. And Paul expands his scope, not just talking about the relationships that exist between Christians. But now he's looking at a broader view of things that pertain to how we interact with all men, our relationship towards those who are in the world. Notice in verse 17, he says, to do what is honorable in the sight of all verse 18, talks about living peaceably with all verse 20, addresses how to deal with your enemies. Hopefully, you don't have an enemy in the Lord's church, because these are our brothers and sisters, this is our family. And so these things are helping us think about and frame our attitude towards those who are outside of the body of Christ. Not in every single verse, but in many of these, it's more inclusive. Notice what he says, in Verse 14, he says, Bless those who persecute you, bless, and do not curse them, in order for us to go against the grain. And the first thing he says about doing something that doesn't come naturally, he says that we must bless instead of curse, to offer blessing instead of a curse. Each one of us has the ability to choose how we speak, the things that we say what comes out of our mouths? Is it going to be something that is for good? Is it going to be a blessing? Or is it going to be something that tears down? That's something that curses or causes, speaks evil of another person, to bless someone else is to speak well of them to say things that are positive that are encouraging, when we build someone up, when we promote them or try to help them. We are seeing the value and the worth that that person has in the sight of God. We are blessing them. Blessings in the scriptures are also associated with God and His kindness. People would call a blessing upon another person, they would ask God to bless someone in the book of Ruth, when Ruth goes out into the fields to gather grain, and she has a great success. And she comes back in and Naomi sees her and she asks, Where have you been threshing today? Where did you go? And she tells her Naomi pronounces a blessing upon bow bow as she says, May he be blessed by the Lord. And it is appropriate and fitting to bless someone who helps you. Imagine if you were moving into a new house, and you had a truck full of boxes and furniture that needed to get into the house, and someone who you didn't know if you turned out to be a neighbor, they came up and they start helping you unload the stuff. Even the big things like the refrigerator and the washer and dryer, they're on the on the backside, they're helping you lift it and get it into the house. What's your response to that? We would probably be surprised we're overwhelmed with gratitude. Thank you so much we express that we we tell them thank you. We say God bless you this this was so helpful. But now I want you to imagine that same scenario. You're moving into a house but instead, while you're inside and you're taking a little break. There's someone who's outside and when you come back out, you see a truck has been loaded up with your stuff. And they are now peeling out of the driveway driving down the road with your favorite favorite recliner secured in the back of the pickup. Now, what are you thinking? You're probably angry, you're confused, you're upset, you're frustrated? What types of things? Are you saying about that person? Probably not stuff you want repeated at church, right?

Conrad Harkrider  10:33
What makes this instruction so unnatural. And what makes it peculiar is not just that we bless the people that help us to bless the people that we like, which by the way we should do. Right, if somebody helps you, somebody gives something to you, you may not be able to repay them. But all of us can express gratitude. All of us can pray to God and say, God, I want you to bless I asked for your blessing upon this person. That's something that we can do. But what makes this instruction difficult and challenging is that we are to Bless those who persecute us. We are to speak well of those who mistreated us. And by the way, this is a, this is a completely radical idea. Gentile are Greek writings, Jewish writings did not promote the idea of blessing those who would curse you who would do evil to you, the Romans were out to punish their enemies, the Jews said, An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth. This is countercultural teaching that Paul is giving to them. And it's still a radical idea today. Jesus said it this way in the Sermon on the Mount, in Luke chapter six and verse 27. He said, But I say to you, who here Love your enemies, do good to those who hate you, bless those who curse you pray for those who abuse you. Jesus said that we need to love our enemies. And that love is an act of love, in the words that we speak, how we talk about them, he says that we should be praying for them, wanting what's in their best interest. And so I was thinking about this and knowing that it's very unnatural kind of step back and say, How is this possible? How can you really bless someone, instead of cursing them, especially when they're doing some type of harm to you. And if you have a real life example, then it gets really difficult to put this into practice, when someone is mistreating us or hurting us, the natural instinct is to have negative, strong feelings against that person to despise or even hate them. And I think when that happens, what's going on, is that we are focusing on on ourselves. We're thinking about how this impacts me, all of my stuff is now gone. What am I going to do? They just kicked up mud on my car, this is a total mess. And we're thinking about it all from our own perspective. But God is calling us to think less about ourselves and more about others. And so in this context, and somebody when somebody is mistreating us or hurting us, instead of thinking about what that means to me, we think about them. We develop a sense of pity for that person. We think about where they're at in their life, what's happened to them, maybe the challenges that they faced, maybe they've been abused, maybe they grew up in a in a terrible home, maybe they're dealing with some type of addiction, or drug problem. Maybe they've always been picked on or whatever it may be. But instead of feeling anger, we feel a sense of sadness. We think this is a person that doesn't have Christ. This is a person that doesn't, they're lost in their way, they don't have that same assurance and hope that we do. And again, this is not by no means something that comes easy. It requires us to change completely change, how we think, to change our attitudes, and our minds and to resolve that we are going to do something that is just it's hard, it's unnatural. It doesn't make sense in our minds, and it requires us to practice to pray about it and to be intentional to bless instead of curse, as they were stoning Stephen for his defense of the gospel. Do you remember what he said in Acts chapter seven, in verse 60. It says, In falling to his knees, he cried out with a loud voice, Lord, do not hold this sin against them. And when he had said this, he fell asleep. His final words towards those who were taking his life was to bless instead of curse that's going against the grain, that type of that type of behavior. That type of response stands out it has an impact on the world. Also notice what he says here in Romans chapter 12 And verse 15. In verse 15, he says, Rejoice with those who rejoice weep with those who weep. To go against the grain, we need to show empathy to others, we need to be empathetic towards others. And practically what this means is that we rejoice with those who rejoice, we weep with those who are weeping.

Conrad Harkrider  15:30
Empathy is the ability to understand, to be aware, to be sensitive, to the feelings, to the thoughts to the experiences of another person, we're able to see things from their perspective, we're able to put ourselves in their shoes. We know the feeling of rejoicing with someone who is rejoicing, a person is now declared cancer free. And that is a wonderful piece of news or information that we receive, and we rejoice with that person. child who's been sick, is able to go home from the hospital, that produces great rejoicing, we are we are thankful to God for that. So when does rejoicing with those who rejoice become difficult? When does it become something that goes against our natural instincts? When Joseph received a beautiful quote from his father, one that had been carefully made, that symbolizes this special love and this connection and relationship that he had with his fathers? How did with his father how to Joseph's brothers react? What was their response to that? Were they overwhelmed with joy? Did they think this is wonderful? Joseph deserves this because he is faithful. He has done all that his father has asked. No, they hated him for it. In fact, they were unwilling to speak peacefully to him. And they ultimately we go on to throw him down into a pit, sell him off into slavery, and then lie about his death to their father, why did they do all of that? Because of jealousy, and envy. When someone else has something that we desire, it makes it very difficult for us, to rejoice with them. Someone who has the same amount of experience as us gets a promotion at work. How are we feeling about that? What type of things are we saying about that person? What type of things? Are we saying to them? Are we rejoicing with them? We're scrolling through social media, and we see the engagement pictures from someone that we went to school with? What do we think about that? I didn't think they get married, or I'm surprised they found someone, you know, is our reaction, to be thankful to rejoice with them to genuinely think that that is, that's great news. That's a wonderful thing. And maybe we don't say anything rude to the person, maybe it's not anything, that we go up and speak to their face. But this verse doesn't say, to be silent towards those who rejoice just to keep your mouth shut, keep your mouth closed. But it says to rejoice with them. There should be an expression of joy that is coming from us on their behalf. I think about my grandmother, as she got later in her life. And we would call her to tell her exciting things. Someone got engaged, we are expecting a new child, we just got a new job. We're moving into new house all these life events that we were experiencing and going through, and she is living by herself. Her children are not at home. Her husband has passed away. She's dealing with her own health issues. And yet, when we would tell her those things, it was as if she was just as excited as we were, she would rejoice with us. And then she'd asked when you come in to see me. When are you going to bring them up here so I can meet them. But she felt that same sense of joy in her heart, bitterness, envy, jealousy, those things have no place in the heart of a Christian. What about weeping with those who weep? This is something that can also be a challenge for us when we are going through when someone is going through a trial when they're grieving a loss. Do we take notice of that? Are we sensitive to those things? You know, I think we live in a culture where people are so eager to move on to the next thing people don't want to stay in a place of sadness for too long. We try to cheer people up. We want to pick them up, move on to the next thing.

Conrad Harkrider  19:57
But weeping with those Those who weep means that we're willing to sit in a place of mourning. It means that we are willing to feel that grief and to share that burden with someone else. To feel pain when others are hit with a tragedy. And if you've been around in those situations, maybe you feel like that it's it's uncomfortable. I don't know what to say, I don't know how to act. But it's not so much knowing the right words to say as it is just to be there for them, to be in their presence, to let them know that you are supporting them. And to show up and listen, in Proverbs chapter 17. In verse 17, it says, A friend loves at all time, and a brother is born for adversity. When we truly care about other people, and we are grateful for how God blesses them, we rejoice with those who are rejoicing. And when we stand by those who are dealing with some type of pain, or adversity, and weep with those who weep. That's the type of that's the type of action and character that is an natural in many respects in the world. And that stands out, it goes against the grain. It allows us to be transformed from this world. And to not be conformed to this world, but to be transformed to the image of God. Also, notice verse 16. In verse 16, he says, Live in harmony with one another, do not be haughty, but associate with the lowly. Never Be wise, in your own opinion, or never be wise in your own sight. To go against the grain means that we should associate with the humble, he starts by saying that we should live in harmony or be of the same mind, what is the same mind or the attitude that God's people should be having to be humble. And this is really a central theme in this section of the book of Romans, starting in chapter 12. And then going through the middle part of chapter 15 is all one section or unit in the book, Paul talks about a number of themes that are inter connected and related. Notice in chapter 12, and verse three, what he says about humility, he says, For by the grace given to me, I say to everyone among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think, but to think with sober judgment, each according to the measure of faith that God has assigned not to think of ourselves more highly than we ought to think. In chapter 13, he addresses this idea of submitting to authority, being submissive to the government, and certainly that requires a measure of humility. In chapter 14, he talks about taking your brother into account, not doing things that would cause harm to your brother, not despising or judging your brother. And certainly that requires a spirit of humility. This attitude is so important in being a follower of Christ, to not be wise, in our own sight. And here in this section, Paul says that to have a spirit of humility means that we associate with people who are low, to be around, to be willing to connect with or speak to, or talk to people who are of a low state. Think about it, if Jesus didn't have this attitude, he wouldn't even even been able to come to the earth. If he was not willing to associate with the humble, there was no one who was worthy of standing in God's presence of being in the presence of the Son of God. It was only because he lowered himself, he emptied himself, and was willing to come and walk among us, to talk with us, to live around us, to touch us, to help us to heal us to teach us. Jesus didn't come to earth and build a castle for himself, or live up in a palace. But he came and dwelt among regular men. He dwelt among the lowest of society, because he knew that they needed his love and His grace, just as much as any of the rest of us or anyone else. Are there certain people that we are reluctant to be around? Do we find ourselves gravitating towards certain classes of people, certain types of individuals at work at school, in the Lord's church? Are we more inclined to talk with and be around certain types of people? Or are we willing to associate with anyone to associate with those who are humble? My dad is a very friendly person and

Conrad Harkrider  24:54
whenever we go out in public, he often will wear a hat. And there was one time we went out to arrest He's wearing a hat of the school where I went Texas a&m. And the waiter came up to the table and notice the hat and they started having a conversation. And my dad went on to tell him when I graduated from high school, and that I was a student there and what I was majoring in, and when I was going to be graduating, and after he left, I looked over at my dad, and I said, you know, we don't even really know him. My dad said, my dad said, yes, he's a fan. And I said, Dad, please don't wear that hat anymore when we go out in public. But what is our what is our attitude towards someone who is in a position of service? Someone who is in cleaning services, someone who is taking a job that is less desirable? Do we view ourselves as too important to visit with a stranger to talk to that waiter? To sit with someone at a table, who doesn't have very many friends or is not as well liked, among our peers, going against the grain means that we associate with people who are humble. Finally, notice verses, verse 19. Verse 19, says, Beloved, never avenge yourselves, but leave it to the wrath of God for His written VENGEANCE IS MINE, I WILL REPAY says the Lord. To the contrary, if your enemy is hungry, feed him, if he is thirsty, give him something to drink, for By so doing, you will heap burning coals on his head, Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil, with good, going against the grain means that we leave it in God's hands. In verse 17, he says, We're not to repay evil for evil, but instead to be at peace with other people. He says, when we are mistreated, we don't avenge ourselves, but we leave it in God's hands, we leave it to the wrath of God, not taking matters into our own hands. But instead, knowing and trusting that God is ultimately going to be the one who judges all men, whether they do good or evil. In verse 20, he quotes from Proverbs 25. And he says, on the contrary of avenging yourselves, we should do what for our enemies, we should feed them, if they're hungry, we should do good to them, we should provide them a drink if they are thirsty. And we're doing these things, not because we're trying to manipulate them, or because we're trying to set a trap for them later on, but we have their best interests in mind. We have that genuine love for them, we desire for their conscience to be touched that they would see our conduct and our attitude and response and that their heart would be pricked, that they would seek repentance, this image or this idea of burning coals upon the head, I think this is a reference to God's judgment, that for those who are unwilling to change, even in the face of when we don't retaliate, retaliate, God is ultimately going to render judgment on those people, when we take but when somebody takes advantage of us or they mistreat us, it's not our role to try to set the record straight. It's not our job to try to make sure that everything is equal, that they are held accountable, and that they are punished. In chapter 13. Paul goes on to talk about the government and how they are, they have a role in that, that the government is God's Avenger, on those who would do evil and that they have a right and an authority to carry out punishments. But it's not our place to try to set the wrongs right, in this life. And one of the reasons for that is if we try to administer punishment, if we try to show retribution on someone, what happens if we don't get it right? What happens if we retaliate too hard? What happens if we get the facts wrong? If that person really wasn't doing something that warranted our punishment, the priests Eli, he was in the, in God's house, and he saw this woman who was standing there and she was muttering her lips. And he went up to her and he rebuked her for being drunk. She was drunk in the house of God. But as it turns out, Hannah was not intoxicated, she was pouring her heart out before the Lord.

Conrad Harkrider  29:34
You see, we don't have perfect clarity and understanding of all the things that are happening and what's going on in every situation. But God does, he knows and he is aware of what we're going through. And so we need to leave it in God's hands put, put our trust in the Lord, that ultimately, he will render judgment to those who are pursuing evil when we We choose not to strike back. When we show restraint, when we walk away, when we back down, that's not a sign of weakness. That's not a sign of incompetence. We're showing strength in those moments. We're putting our our faith and our trust in the Lord, we leave it in his hands. When Jesus was on the cross, the final moments of his life, he's being executed by men who are taunting him, who are ridiculing him. Men who are, he's been falsely accused. And yet he lifts up his voice to God. And he says in Luke chapter 23, and verse 34, Father forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing. Instead of taking charge of his fate, Jesus places his trust. in God's hands, he knew that it was God's will for him to suffer. And then it was his purpose in coming to earth, not to try to destroy and to take over all men, but to extend grace and love to save them from their wickedness. He displayed this compassion and love, even to the very end of his life. And we have to strive to do the same, to have love in our hearts for other people. No matter how we may be treated in this life, we've got to constantly fight against our natural tendency to swim upstream to go against the grain. And when we do those things, it will cause us to shine as lights in this world, we will be different, we will stand out to the praise and glory of God. We're going to close this morning with a song to encourage you if there's something that we can do to support or help you in your relationship with Christ. If you need the prayers of this group here to make a confession of some type of sin or if you're ready to begin your walk with Christ, then we want to encourage you in whatever way we can. You can use this time to come down to the front as we stand in scene
