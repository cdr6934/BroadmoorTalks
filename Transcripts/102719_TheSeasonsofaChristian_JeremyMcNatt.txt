Tonight I'll be looking at not the seasons that we experienced out side. So fall, winter, spring summer. But tonight, I like to focus our thoughts a little bit on the seasons of a Christian. And I think this fits well, somewhat well with the lines of Conrad's lessons this morning, where each of these examples that we're hopefully going to look at this evening, definitely went against the grain, so to speak. So tonight, we're gonna look at the four stages of life, as I've kind of outlined them, we're gonna look at the child teenage years, the young adults, middle adults, or middle aged adults, and then the older adults, will look at a few biblical examples in the scriptures of these life seasons, and we'll look at what they were doing for the kingdom of God. And then hopefully, we'll have some time where I can provide some observations for each group. I will say that Curtis made mention in his lesson today, and Acts about 40 years old was considered old in this age. So that kind of threw off my whole thinking as to what age group I had people sorted into. So just keep in the back of your mind that we're going to look at the different stages of life and kind of what we can learn from each group there. So I'd like to start off this this evening, looking at children and teenagers, what can we learn from different examples in the Bible, like to start out by looking at Samuel, Samuel, as we know was the son of Hannah and Elkanah he was bowed, Hannah vowed to to God that if she were if she was to be blessed with a son, that she would give him to the Lord forever. And as Hannah promised, what Samuel was weaned, and we're talking probably between the ages, I guess, have between two and three years old, that she took him to ILA that she could took him to Isla, to the priests, and she lent him to God. So if you want you flip over to First Samuel, the book of First Samuel, and as we read, First Samuel, I believe, you can see the physical and the spiritual growth of Samuel. in First Samuel chapter two, verse 11, and 18. And then again, in verse three, and one, we see that Samuel, as a child was ministering or serving the Lord. And he was doing this while he was learning from Eli, the priest. This ministering or serving. In my studies, it likely suggested that he was, you know, learning how to behave. He was learning how to behave in worship, he was learning how to serve others. But nonetheless, he was learning from Eli, the priest. in First Samuel chapter two, verse 26, we can see that as Samuel got older, he grew in stature, and he grew in favor, not only with the Lord, but also among men. I think this also speaks to how Samuel was treating others how he treated them fairly. And you can contrast that with Eli's own two sons, and how they were corrupt, they were evil, and how they took advantage of other individuals. So I think that actually speaks a little bit to just how much men thought of Samuel because he was not the ways of Eli sons. in First Samuel chapter three, we see that God appears to Samuel and God tells him that Eli and his sons would die because of the sins of the sons, and the fact that Isla had not rebuked them properly. I think from this vantage point from from, from what we can learn about Samuel took a lot of courage for him to ultimately go before Eli and tell him what had been said, what God had told him. But at the end of verse, chapter three, we can see that Samuel grew, and the Lord was with him the entire time. Another example that we can learn from is Josiah. Josiah, as we know was the was the son of evil king Amnon Emin, and after m and had been executed by his servant, Josiah was making he was making at the age of eight years old. So when you consider his reign, you can easily take a step back and think well, it would have been very easy for Josiah to follow in the footsteps of his father. However, we see in in Second Kings, chapter 22, verse two, we read that Josiah did what was right in the sight of the Lord. He did not follow in the evil ways of his father. So this may suggest that Josiah was blessed with godly people around him. Maybe he had some advisors that were around him that gave him that taught him the right way to go.

Jeremy Mcnatt  04:54
In Second Kings chapter 22, verse beginning of verse 10, through verse 13. We see that saya here's the words of the Lord that are spoken him by some of his advisers. He was so moved at what he heard that he says that he tore his clothes. And then he ordered those that were with him to go and ask the Lord what he should do, or what they should do rather. And he did this because as he was hearing the word spoken, he realized that the people had not been obedient, they had not obeyed God, they had not done what God had said. So in Second Kings beginning verse, chapter 22, verse 17, these men hear from God, they find out that the Lord says that his wrath would be poured out on the people that had forsaken him. However, because of Josiah is humble and penitent heart, we hear the Lord tells him that you will be spared from this impending judgment. And then it goes on in chapter 23 of Second Kings chapter 23. That Josiah went out, and ultimately purged the nation. He basically took away pagan worship that was in the city in the country, he reestablished the covenant that was with the Lord. He reinstituted the Passover Feast, which had been neglected for quite a while for quite some time. So these are two examples that we have here in the Old Testament of children of teenagers, or teen ager age, individuals that were doing good, that were obedient to God that were doing what they were supposed to. So what can we take away from that? Or this age group, I think, number one, we can see that our knowledge, our understanding, and our relationship with God can begin at a very early age. Consider that Samuel was very young and he began ministering to the Lord. And as you can see, our congregation is full of young children that are learning about just how awesome and powerful and mighty and wonderful God is. You can hear it when they sing songs, you can hear it when prayers are said you can see it when maybe fathers are up here directing song service and the children are following along. They're learning that at a very early age. I think number two, you can see that the relationships early in life that are typically initiated by our parents, not always, but they can have a significant impact on our children's lives. Samuel was left with Eli the priest. Why can we would imagine what happened if he'd been left with Eli's two sons, who may have a totally different story that we'd be reading about? Josiah the same way what if he had really been, you know, paying attention to the, to the way that his father lived, Josiah may not have ruled in such a godly way. So the relationships that we have early in life can definitely have an impact on us as we get older, but also, as children are growing up as well. Number three, at a young age, we can learn how to properly behave and teach others, Samuel, it says, gained favor in the sight of man because he treated them fairly, unlike the sons of Eli, who cheated men out of their offerings to the Lord by basically taking what was the best and keeping it for themselves. So when you think about it, from that standpoint, how we're teaching our children to behave and treat other individuals, you know, are we teaching them those things early on, because they can certainly learn it? Are we teaching them to say thank you, or we're teaching them to say, please? Are we teaching them to be obedient to others? Are we teaching them to say, to pay attention and Bible class, those are all things that we can do. Children are smart, they pick up on that sort of thing. You know, I'm with Lucas. Now we're definitely beginning to pick up that he hears everything, He sees everything, he hears everything. Driving here, he was just muttering moto Moto, but it was things that he had heard in the past. Now, granted, he was talking about tractor trailers. So you know, those were things that he had heard. But you can see that they pick up on those sorts of things, and they hear and they're listening, and they can learn how to behave and to treat others. I think number four, what we can learn from this from children and from the teenage group is that the word of God should move us when we're disobedient. And it should cause us to ask forgiveness. As a young child or teenager it should move us emotionally. When we do something wrong. Even as adults it should move us emotionally when we do something wrong. But you saw it in Josiah, when he heard the word of God spoken, how he tore his clothes and how he was so upset because he realized that the people had been obedient, that he literally said we need to stop what we're doing, and go and find out how God would have us to live and how to behave.

Jeremy Mcnatt  09:43
So children godly influences can impact us knowing from right to wrong. And when we learn the truth, we should be penitent about it when somebody corrects us, we should be passionate about it and we should be very much wanting to change and to please God. So that moves To the next age group, which would be the young adults. So got a couple of examples here again from the Old Testament, the first one is Daniel and his three friends. So you may want to be turning to Daniel chapter one. Daniel chapter one. After God had delivered Jehovah cam in Jerusalem over to Nebuchadnezzar, the king sent out one of his servants, to bring back youths that were intelligent network wise, that could serve one day in the king's palace. Among those taking were Daniel and his three friends, Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. All these captives were giving food rations, of course, they were given three years of training so that they could eventually serve in Nebuchadnezzar his court. But in Daniel chapter one, verse eight, the scriptures say that Daniel resolved that he would not defile himself with the Kings food, are the one that he drained the word resolve their means to be fully determined to do something. And Daniel was fully determined not to defile himself he was, he knew that eating the king's food would have violated the restrictions of that day for the Hebrews. And he wanted to remain holy. So as a young person, Daniel was determined to keep himself holy. Later on in Daniel chapter one, in verse eight, it says that Daniel asked the servant of Nebuchadnezzar, not to make them eat the king's food or drink the wine because it would have defiled them. I never had really thought about this until I was digging a little bit into this study. But Daniel, it says there that Daniel asked for this to be done, he asked the servant this. Daniel wasn't hateful, Daniel wasn't rude, he wasn't ugly about anything. He was very diplomatic. In a way, he basically asked the servant to not allow them to defile themselves. And I think this is important, because when you get to verse 10, and 10, through 14, the servant then acknowledges that he's afraid of the king. And, you know, he's afraid that the king might put Him to death if he doesn't follow through with this. So Daniel makes a suggestion. test us. And what was that test? Test these four men by bringing them vegetables and water for 10 days? Before we get too far, one of my points is not that children should eat vegetables and drink water all the time. I'm prepared to say that now. But it is ironic that those were the things that that Daniel and and his friends said, bring those to us, test us when we when you say our appearance. So the young man who ate the king's food and drink the one that came back 10 days later, and what did they find out, they saw that Daniel and his four friends, their parents was very good. Their parents was very healthy. Trans can contrast that to his friends. So the man, Daniel and his four friends, they had confidence, right, they had confidence and trust and faith in God, that he would take care of them that he would see them through this difficult time. So because of their faith and obedience, God gave the four men knowledge and skill and all literature and wisdom. And it goes on to say that Daniel was also given understanding of visions and dreams. Another group of men will go back to in Daniel chapter three is Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. Now, these three men had refused to fall down and worship Nebuchadnezzar, his golden image, punishment for their obedience was obviously to be thrown into a fiery furnace. And when they were brought before the king, they gave this wonderful statement of faith that we see in verses 17 and 18, of chop Daniel, chapter three, our God whom we serve, is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and He will deliver us out of your hand, oh king, but if not, be it known to you, oh king, that we will not serve your gods or worship the golden image that you have set up. And it was because of their faith that was causing their obedience, that God predicted those three men, and they survived the fire. Now, that had an immediate impact on Nebuchadnezzar, as you can imagine, he was an all so in verses 28 and 29 of Daniel chapter three, it says that Nebuchadnezzar said, bless it be the God of Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego, who ascend as Angel and delivered as servants and trust who trusted in him and set aside the king's command, and yielded up their bodies rather than serve and worship any god except their own God. For there is no other God who was delivered able to deliver in this way.

Jeremy Mcnatt  14:34
Because of what had what the king had seen. He ultimately made a decree that anyone who spoke evil of God would be killed in their homes and destroyed their homes and their homes destroyed. The king also ended up promoting Shadrach Meshach and Abednego in the province of Babylon as well. The next individual in the Old Testament that I like to bring to our attention is Joseph Joseph, we talked a little bit about Joseph this morning, we talked about how he was the envy of his brothers how they threw him into a pit. They sold him to the Midianite traders that then took him to Egypt. Ultimately, the, the media knights sewed them to Potiphar, who was an officer of Pharaoh. He has been accused of by Potiphar, his wife of misconduct, he was then thrown into prison. And then he was only released out of prison after he was able to interpret the dreams of Pharaoh. Despite all of the circumstances, and all these things that happened to Joseph, there's three quick points that I want to bring up. Number one, throughout all of this, he was honorable. In Genesis chapter 39, verses two through 23, we read about Joseph and Potter for his wife. Despite the advances of Potter first wife, Joseph refused to give into temptation. He said in verses eight and nine of chapter 39, behold, because of me, My master has no concern about anything in the house. And he has put everything that he has in my charge, he is not greater in this house than I am, nor has he kept anything back from me except you, because of you, because you are his wife. How then can I do this great wickedness and sin against God? Joseph was honorable by refusing the temptations of Potiphar his wife. He was wives we see in Genesis chapter 41, verses 37, through 56, that in this section of Scripture, we read a Joseph rise to power in Egypt, especially after he's already interpreted the dreams of Pharaoh, and those dreams where there's going to be seven years of plenty, followed by seven years of famine. At the age of 30, we see that Pharaoh that that Joseph entered the service of Pharaoh over the land of Egypt, and during the seven years that the earth was full of food that was plentiful. Joseph was gone around, storing up grain in preparation for the seven years of famine, the Scriptures say in Genesis 41, verses 46, and 56, and 57. So when the famine had spread over all the land, Joseph opened all the store houses and so to the Egyptians, for the famine was severe in the land of Egypt. Moreover, all the earth came to Egypt to Joseph to buy grain, because the famine was severe all over the earth. So Joseph was wise in the fact that he remembered what he had told Pharaoh, and he was going out and preparing for that. In Genesis, chapter 50, verses 15 through 21, we see that Joseph was forgiving. Here, the father of Joseph and his brothers has passed away. And now his brothers fear that Joseph will punish them very harshly for selling them in for putting him into slavery. But listen, what Joseph tells them in Genesis chapter 50, verses 19, through 21, do not fear for Am I in the place of God. As for you, you meant evil against me, but God meant it for good to bring it about that many people should be kept alive as they are today. So do not fear I will provide for you and your little ones. Thus he comforted them and spoke kindly to them. So he see here that Joseph was also very forgiving. So three applications from this age group. As young adults, we must make a firm decision to follow God's commandments. Daniel, his friends, Joseph, they were all resolved to do the right thing, and that was to remain faithful and holy to God. As young adults, we will encounter the world on a daily basis.

Jeremy Mcnatt  18:50
As children, we will encounter the world on a daily basis. As older adults, we will encounter the world on a daily basis. And we must be resolved to follow God's commandments, regardless of what the crowd is doing. Number two, we need to surround ourselves with godly influences. Daniel and his friends, they weren't alone when they were facing the King Nebuchadnezzar when they had to make that decision. So having friends that were around them made a huge impact for them. They had each other lean on for support. And don't you find that when you're facing difficulty in life, so that when you have someone that you can talk to where you can get godly sound advice from, it helps, it can be other adults, they older adults, it could be friends, it could be parents, but it helps having those godly influences in your life. And I think number three, one thing that we can learn from this and from this age group, as I mentioned earlier, wasn't something that I originally thought about. But it's nice if we need to be respectful. We need to be respectful, and our daily interactions with others so that they can see God in us with Daniel requested vegetables and water instead of the kings delicate cuz he's, he did so politely He asked if the if that servant would do this. When Joseph was faced with the decision about his brothers after their father's death, he chose to be kind and not harsh. This can sometimes be very hard to do, right, especially when we've been wrong, but it's the right thing to do what God expects of us. So the third age group is middle age. And some examples here would include the apostles. After Christ was tempted by the devil, he began his ministry, and started to preach saying in Matthew four, verse 17, Repent for the kingdom of heaven is at hand. As Jesus walked by the Sea of Galilee, he saw Simon and Andrew fishing. He called them follow me, and I'll make you fishers of men. And they dropped what they were doing, and they follow Christ. A little while later, he saw James and John, mending nets, he called them also, they did the same thing. Go to Matthew chapter nine. And as Jesus is passing through, he sees Matthew, the tax collector, probably working at his deaths. He says, Follow me. The Scriptures tell us that Matthew got up and he followed Jesus. With faith, these men immediately left their jobs, responsibilities, they left their families, they followed a stranger to become fishers of men. To me, that is something that be very difficult and hard to do, to have somebody just walk by, say, Follow me, and then be willing to drop everything and follow that person. But these men had faith, they had faith that was powerful enough for them to follow Jesus. Another example is Saul. We could go on and on about the lessons that we learn about Saul and Paul in the New Testament. But briefly, he was a primary participant in the persecution of those early Christians. He approved and oversaw the stoning of Stephen. And in Acts chapter eight, verse three, it says that Saul was ravaging the church, entering house after house, dragging off men and women and committing them to prison. A threat to Christians a threat to the early church, but solid example that anybody can change, solid example that if you commit yourself to the Gospel, anything is possible. When you think about his conversion, it starts in Acts chapter nine, beginning in verse three through non where it saw was on the Damascus Road, a bright light came down, it blinded him. And there was a voice that came saw, why are you persecuting me? In Acts chapter nine, verses 10 through 16, we see where Saul was taken to Damascus. And it's revealed to him to by Jesus to deny us that Saul was the chosen instrument of Jesus to carry my name before the Gentiles and kings and children of Israel, for I will show him how much he must suffer for the sake of My name. And then in I in verses 18 through 20, of Acts, chapter nine, after regaining his sight, saw was baptized and he immediately began teaching about Jesus in the synagogues. So you can see that Saul went from a man who was persecuting the church to a man who was dragging people out of the Christians out of their home, committing them to prison, a man who oversaw the stoning of Stephen, how the power of Christ was able to change him to someone who immediately after he had regained decide after he had been been impacted so greatly by the words of Jesus was able to go out and begin preaching his name. And then finally, we have Barnabas. Barnabas was known as the Son of Encouragement, and certainly he deserved that name. Acts chapter 11. Verse 24, tells us that Barnabas was a good man, full of the Holy Spirit and a faith. Just listen to some of the things that Barnabas did. In Acts chapter four,

Jeremy Mcnatt  23:52
verses 36 and 37. We read that Barnabas sold his land, and he gave the money to the apostles to give to the early Christians who had a need. Barnabas put his needs before put the needs of others before himself. In Acts chapter nine verses 26 and 27, we see that Barnabas defended Saul's conversion to the apostles when he brought him to Jerusalem. Imagine just the amount of bravery that that must have taken to be able to go up and defend Saul knowing that probably everyone else around is convinced that he's there to do them harm, but also managed in the trust that this must have taken for him to do this good deed as well. He had witnessed saw preaching, he had seen him preaching in Damascus, in the name of Jesus. So he knew that this change of heart was real. He was a firsthand he witnessed all this firsthand. And Acts chapter 11 verses 22 through 30. We read that Barnabas was sent by the apostles to the early church in any where he taught many people. He went to Tarsus to find some also that they could go back and teach the early the church at Antioch. And also we see that he was sent to Judea by the elders to help with the famine relief. So he was doing all of these wonderful things, encouraging as many people as he could. And finally, in Acts, chapter 13, we read that Barnabas joined Paul, on his first missionary journey to Cyprus, and then to the cities of Malaysia there in Asia Minor. So we have three wonderful examples of men that were middle aged, if you will, that were able to do some really amazing things that really encouraged us. So what are some applications we can make from that? Well, I think number one, is that we must make a decision to put Jesus first in our lives despite our other obligations. Jesus Christ must come before our work before our relationships, before school before material things. You know, the 12 apostles left everything. I mean, they left everything behind that they follow Jesus just by him uttering just a few words. It doesn't necessarily mean though, that they stopped caring about those other things. It doesn't mean that they forgot about family and friends and those individuals. But I think it means that they made a priority in serving Jesus and serving Christ and spreading the gospel. That was their priority. That was their new priority. Number two, we need to be an encouragement to others. We're not going to the Christian is in need, we should be ready to help them whatever way that we can. Sometimes that means material blessings, food, clothing, shelter, sometimes that could mean giving them someone money. Sometimes it may be defending somebodies faith, maybe you've seen somebody do something good, and maybe you're defending them against others. Like Barnabas, we need to be an encourager. Sometimes that means putting others before ourselves. Number three, we can do something to help others and be a worker in the church. Some people use their gifts and talents to organize a work room in the back. Some people use their gift of creativity to put together wonderful bulletin boards for the kids. Some people teach the gospel in their communities, some people are an example and teach at work. Some people have Bible studies in their homes. Some individuals organized Bible studies at restaurants where they plaster it to social media. And they encourage people to come and study. Some people write birthday cards, some people write sympathy cards, some people write welcome cards to members and preachers and that we support and visitors, there's always something that we can do doesn't necessarily mean that it's always on the front page. And in the headlines, and it's what we see all the time. But there's always something that we can do. And I think number four like saw, we need to be really be willing to change when we're taught the truth and corrected by other individuals by other Christians. And finally, our last age group for the evening is our older adults. Now, if Curtis was here, these people would definitely fall into the older adult class. So we have Noah 600 years old Noah was when he entered the art with his family and his friends. In Genesis six we read that God was ready to destroy the Earth, because of man's wickedness. But Noah found grace and God's odds. Genesis chapter six, verse nine says that Noah was a just man, perfect in this generations and that Noah walked with God,

Jeremy Mcnatt  28:30
before destroying the earth, with the floodwaters. God gave Noah special instructions on how to build the ark. And we were told in Genesis chapter six, verse 22, that Noah did exactly how God told him to. We're also told in Genesis chapter seven, verse five, that God told Noah, who am want to enter they are. And just like before Noah followed those instructions. After the floodwaters receded, and Noah and his family, they exited the ark. And Noah immediately built an altar and prepared a burn offering to God. Because of Noah's faith and trust in the Lord. The Covenant was then established between him and God, they would never destroy the Earth again with the floodwaters. Noah was ready to obey God immediately at the age of 600. I'm not sure that I'm ready to do something like that right now. But Noah was. So I think there's a lesson there for us that we're never too old to trust and obey. And we have to be ready at all times. Imagine how hard this must have been for Noah, for his family, not to get worn down by people coming constantly during that time period, and saying things to them and questioning them and that type of thing. Because the people as we know we're sinful. What about Abraham at the age of 75, the Lord instructed him to leave his home and go to Atlanta that God would show him full of faith Abraham did exactly that. He took his wife took his nephew took all of his possessions, and they left their home and traveled to Canaan. And in Genesis chapter 12 Verses one went through a we find out that the Lord promised to give this land to Abraham's descendants. Abraham, Abraham's faith was also tested with Isaac. When God commanded him to take Isaac and offer him as a bird offering to God. As difficult as this must have been for Abraham, he did it he did as he was commanded. And after God saw that Abraham was faithful and willing to sacrifice his only son, or his son as a sacrifice, he sent an angel there to then stop that sacrifice. Abraham was ready to leave and God told him to and Abraham Abraham was willing to offer Isaac as a sacrifice. When God told him to that faith was tested over and over and over again. Last example would be Timothy's grandmother, Lois, and mother Eunice. And a second letter to Timothy Paul commends his religious upbringing. Paul says Timothy is genuine faith was first seen in his grandmother and in his mother. It was this upbringing that had a significant first impression upon Timothy and helped to foster his spiritual growth. As we become older, we need to be preparing ourselves now. To be the next Christian influencers. We need to be examples to our children and grandchildren. Beyond that, we need to be Krishna examples to students in our classes, and young couples who are just starting out as a married union. So some applications and things that we can learn from this older adult group is number one, we will never be too old to trust and obey God. Like I said before Noah was 600 years old. Abraham was 75 when they were told to build an art, and to leave their home. Number two, we can be an encouragement to other Christians, regardless of our age, like Lois and Eunice they were the spiritual examples that Timothy had in his life. We can be that example in our children's life, we can be that example in our young couples life, or new converts life. regardless of our age, we should be ready to teach and encourage others to follow the gospel and obey God's commandments. And finally, my last application exam and application from this group is, as we get older, I believe we have an obligation to teach others the gospel, we have an obligation to teach those that are coming up that are younger, those children, those grandchildren, we have an obligation to do that. So just like the seasons are full of change, so is the life of a Christian. Everything comes full circle, right. As a child, we're taught to pop the Word of God by those that are older than us. As we get older, we grow physically, and we grow spiritually, and our faith is tested. We have to make decisions and sacrifices at times that are different at different points in our lives. But with that spiritual growth comes an opportunity to be an example to others, we begin to teach and we begin to train younger Christians that may start at home. We're viewed an example and become a spiritual mentor to a young person. As we learned in our last section, we're never too old to trust and obey God. And Christians that are older. They're a wonderful example of just how to persevere in this world and persevere to life's trials. So in closing, Paul tells Timothy in Second Timothy chapter four verse two, to preach the Word, to be ready in season and out of season, reprove, rebuke, and exhort with complete patience and teaching.

Jeremy Mcnatt  33:31
And that's how I like to close our lesson tonight, using Paul's words and his instructions, and his encouragement to Timothy, for us all to be ready to preach when the time presents itself. Whatever what season it may be, to be patient when we're teaching, to reprove, rebuke, and exhort those around us. So no matter what season of life you may be in this evening, I would say that this congregation is ready to support you. We're ready to assist you in any way. You may need prayers or encouragement. And we're happy to do that. You may have been studying with someone and you have come to conclusion that you need to obey the gospel and that you need to do what is right. And we're happy to help you there as well if that is baptism that you need, but whatever your needs are, if there's anything that we can do, will you stand will you come to the front as we stand in saying our invitation song
