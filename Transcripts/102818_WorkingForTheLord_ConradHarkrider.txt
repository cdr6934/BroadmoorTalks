Good morning, do you have your Bibles in would it be turning to Ephesians, the sixth chapter.

Conrad Harkrider  00:23
I heard a story recently about a man who was giving a seminar for young people. And he was talking to them about different jobs within a community. And he had them do this activity where each one of them was assigned a different occupation. And then they had, he asked them to lineup and try to decide which one of those was the most important to the community. And so there was a doctor, and there was a lawyer, and an engineer, and an accountant, and a salesman, and a musician, and even a garbage man. And they had to try and figure out who would be placed in the first position. Now, as you can imagine, there was debates going on about who was the most important, should it be the doctor, he's vital for the health and the well being of the community. Or you really need the police officer because he protects people and make sure that everyone is following the laws. But then again, who wants to live in a community where the garbage man is not doing his job and taking out the trash. And so finally, after this debate for about 10 minutes, he stopped them and he said, I want you to get into a circle. And then he explained that there is no priority when it comes to the different roles or jobs within a community that all are necessary, all are important, and significant. This instructor was relaying another event that happened to him. He said that one morning, he got up early, and he was outside. And it just so happened that the garbage truck was coming by his house, and he went out to the curb. And when the man came to pick up his trash, he said, I just want to thank you for the work that you're doing. I want you to know how important you are to this community. And we appreciate you. And the guy stood there and looked at him a little bit. And then he said, Are you are you coming in from the night or going out for the day? Kind of a an odd thing to say to the garbage man. But he wanted to convey that every person no matter what their job is, they play a role in making a community. What it is this morning, I want to talk about the idea of our work. And in connection with our theme for 2018 of being faithful stewards, I believe that our occupations are every day Monday through Friday jobs are blessings that God has entrusted us with whether we are working for a company or working at a restaurant or whether we work in the home, all of us have work to do and that work is it is significant, because we are working for the Lord. Before we get to our text in Ephesians chapter six, I want to just go over a few foundational principles about this idea of work. First of all, notice

Conrad Harkrider  03:38
that God has created man for work God has created us to be workers in Genesis chapter two and verse 15. It says the Lord God took the man and put him in the garden of Eden to work and keep it. Notice that in the very beginning before sin had entered into the world, and man was living in the Garden of Eden in this paradise that God had prepared for him. He wasn't just eating fruit and relaxing by the stream. God didn't tell Adam I want you to find something that you enjoy something that you are passionate about. Something that makes you happy and spend your time doing that. No, instead God assigned them work. Now apparently, they didn't have to worry about food or clothing. But he does say they need to take care of the garden to keep it to look after it they were entrusted with a responsibility. After eating of the fruit, one of the punishments that got imposed on the man who was that his work was big, it was going to become much more difficult. He says that thorns and thistles would come from the ground and by the sweat of his brow he would be able to eat bread life outside of the garden would be much more difficult. And that was evident in the amount of work that was required for the man to eat. Working would be necessary for survival. The Wisdom literature has quite a bit to say about work and Proverbs chapter 28. In verse 19, it says, Whoever works, his land will have plenty of bread, but he who follows worthless pursuits will have plenty of poverty. Notice the parallel statement that's made there it says, Those who work will have plenty of bread. But in the contrary, those who do not will have plenty of poverty. Those who follow worthless pursuits, the NIV says those who are chasing after fantasies, you know, anyone who is chasing after a worthless pursuit. These are things that, that don't pay the bills, they don't pay rent, they often don't pay anything. And we think about jobs and occupations, we need to be honest with ourselves, we live in a time where there are literally 1000s of different types of jobs that one could pursue, but blogging about travel or playing music. Those may be things that I love to do, but may not provide for myself. And so maybe that should be treated as a hobby instead of an occupation. Work is exactly what it sounds like. It is work. And it's not always going to be enjoyable or fun or exciting. But yet that is what God has created man to do. Paul says something about the purpose of our work in Ephesians chapter four and verse 28. He says, Let the thief no longer steal, but rather let him labor doing honest work with his own hands, so that he may have something to share with anyone in need. One of the main reasons why we work is to provide for ourselves, he says no longer that you would have to steal so that we don't have to take from others or so that we don't have to beg or rely on someone else to take care of us. But did you notice the other reason for our work, so that we can be able to give to be generous God wants His people to be generous with the things that they have. But we can't be generous if we don't have resources and we can't have resources in a godly way if we're not honestly laboring and working with our hands. In Ecclesiastes chapter five, and verse 18, the writer says this Behold, what I have seen to be good and fitting is to eat and drink and find enjoyment. In all the toil with which one toils under the sun and the few days of his life that God has given him for this is his lot. You ever gotten home from a long day? And and somebody asks you, what did you do today? And you say, Well, I just went to work. As if that's some kind of uneventful thing, all I did was go to work, the writer of Ecclesiastes says, that one should find enjoyment in the work that they do that this is something that God has given to us at the end of the verse, he says, this is his lot, his portion his reward, it is something that has been given to us and it is significant. It is meaningful, this task that we have been given by God. I want to say a few words about the difference between secular and ministry, or the the distinction that is sometimes made between these two. There are many, many churches today that are blessed with men, or individuals who spend their entire time devoted to the work of that church. They spend their efforts studying and preaching, teaching, counseling, helping other people, they could be an evangelist, or an elder or some other minister or servant of the church. They are often supported by the the collection, the contributions that are made. And in fact, here at Broadmoor, we support a number of men in this way, so that they can dedicate themselves their time and their efforts to teaching and preaching the Word. And the example that we mentioned at the beginning, about the different types of jobs and the students trying to place them in order of importance. What if one of the occupations was a preacher or a minister? Where would that rank among the different roles would that automatically be placed at the very front and first place. We often revere and honor those who have dedicated their lives to this type of work. And we should, there is great sacrifice that's made. They do tremendous work. They are important in the body of Christ, and they need support and encouragement, we may hear a story about a man who quits his job and goes into preaching to do the Lord's work. And this is sometimes referred to as a calling people are compelled to go on a mission or to go into some type of ministry. But are there two different classes of people? Does God see one as better than the other more important than the other? Do we have a system of a clergy and then the layman in First Corinthians chapter 12, in verse 14, it says, For the body does not consist of one member, but many, if the foot should say, because I am not a hand, I do not belong to the body, that would not make it any less part of the body. Paul's emphasizing the differences between members. And I think, as it applies to what we're speaking about, if you have a mouth that preaches and teaches God's word, then it is important, it is a part of the body. But if you have a hand that goes to work Monday through Friday, and does a job, then it is important, it is a part of the body, there is no one member that should be elevated over another. I think it's a misunderstanding to, to say or to think that it's only when I'm teaching a class, or when I'm studying my Bible, or when I'm attending a service or doing something spiritual, that that's when I'm serving the Lord.

Conrad Harkrider  11:54
And then the person who works in the office and goes in Monday through Friday, they're just engaging in some type of, of worldly activity. Romans chapter 12, says, Paul says that we present our bodies as a living sacrifice, that is, our entire life, our whole self is presented up to God as a sacrifice. And that means my hobbies, my free time, the things that I do at my home, and and the things that I do at work during the day, my occupation that is an offering to God. As one writer said, God's interest is not simply that we do holy activities, but that we become holy people. And I think sometimes we get into a mindset where we think somebody who spends all of their time doing these holy things, they are somehow hold a position that is that is preferred. But we serve and honor God in a variety of ways. And most of that will occur outside of the walls of this building.

Conrad Harkrider  13:05
So let's turn our attention to Ephesians six, and focus the rest of our time on our labor for the Lord specifically when we are in the workplace, and how that is an offering that is a service to God, and what that should look like on on a practical level. Read with me in Ephesians chapter six. In verse five, it says, bondservants be obedient to those who are your masters according to the flesh with fear and trembling, in sincerity of heart as to Christ, not with I service as men pleasers, but as Bond servants of Christ doing the will of God from the heart, with goodwill doing service as to the Lord and not to men. Knowing that whatever good anyone does, he will receive the same from the Lord, whether he is a slave or free. And you masters do the same things to them giving up threatening knowing that your own master also is in heaven. And there is no partiality with him. Here in Ephesians. In this section, Paul is giving instruction to different groups. At the end of chapter five, he speaks to the wives and to husbands in the beginning of chapter six, he addresses children and fathers. And now here in verse five, Ephesians, six, five, he speaks to the bondservants or the slaves in the Roman Empire, I'm told that about a third of the population fell into this category they were serving under some type of, of masters. So there would have been a number of Christians that found themselves in this situation. Although it's not a part of our culture, today, there are a number of parallels between the things that God says to the servants and to the masters here, and the responsibilities that we Have when we engage in a work environment, look at what Verse eight says. It says, knowing that whatever good anyone does, he will receive the same from the Lord, whether he is a slave or free. So this is not just isolated to those who have a obligation under a master, but this is for all of us. And I want you to think about your work, whether that's in a an office setting, or if you work in some type of retail, or sales, or if you are in a school or hospital, or even if you are a student going to classes, I want you to think about your responsibilities there. Even if you're working in the home, taking care of children or a family member. And think about your work in laboring for the Lord. Notice, first of all, that it starts with attitude. In verse five, he says that they are to be obedient to those who are their masters. according to the flesh with fear and trembling in sincerity, of heart, Christians should be the type of people that show respect, and regard for those who are in authority regardless of how deserving or worthy they may be. It's one thing to submit to the boss, who is very well liked, they have your best best interests at heart, they check up on you, they support you, they are interested in you as a person, they are concerned with you growing and progressing or doing well in whatever position you may be in. Those are the bosses that we like, but in the course of your lifetime working in hourly jobs, or if you move up into more of a career, how many of those bosses do you think you're going to have? More than, more often than not, they are the exception rather than the standard. And so often we find ourselves placed in a position underneath someone who they may not treat us how we think we need to be treated and what is our response? In those circumstances? What type of attitude do we display, when that pressure is coming on us?

Conrad Harkrider  17:22
When we're laboring for the Lord, we need to think about having a sincere and honest and godly attitude. You know, it's so easy to start complaining about things that happen. At work, we used to work in this building that was very old, 40 years old. And when you walked in, it sort of felt like you were going into a dungeon. It was so dark in there. And at times, I felt like I needed a flashlight at my desk just to see what was going on. But eventually, we got moved out of there into this new workspace completely renovated windows on every side. And you want to know what some of the comments were when we first got in there. It's too bright in here. There's the sun is just baking me at my desk and it's glaring on my screen. And that's that can happen to us, we get into this habit, where we feel like it is our right to critique everything. We we critique our boss, we critique our co workers, we talk about the company, we talk about the work that we're doing. And we get into this habit where we're constantly fed feeding this negative attitude. Bond bondservants who Paul is addressing here, they didn't have a choice about their employment or the tasks that they were assigned. And yet Paul says they should have a sincere attitude, even when they're being asked to do things that they don't like or they would rather go and do something else. Now, gratefully, you and I are not in that situation. If I want to leave my job I can. It's employment at will we can choose to go somewhere else at any point. But if we do decide to stay there, we need to have a genuine and honest attitude about the work that we're doing. Also, we need to remember who our boss is. Remember who we're ultimately working for. Look at verse five. At the end of verse five, he says, this should be done as to Christ. In verse six. He says, We are bond servants of Christ. In verse seven, he says, as to the Lord. And then in verse nine he says that knowing your own master is also in heaven. Your boss is not the one who is writing your check, or doing your review or looking over your work. We are serving In Christ, how much attention and effort and energy do we put into our jobs? I remember one summer I was working for my girlfriend's father. And he's now my father in law. So that worked out, okay. But he wanted us to hold these rocks, they were big, flat rocks about 30 pounds. And he was going to be doing some landscaping around his house, we had to go to this construction site, load them onto a flatbed trailer, take them back to his house, take them off of the trailer and into the backyard. Somehow a wheel barrel was never a part of the equation. I'm not sure if that was intentional or not. But I wanted him to see that I was a hard worker. I wanted to show that I was careful when I was given a task, that I wasn't the type of person that slacked off that I was strong and industrious, you know the type of guy you would want your daughter to one day marry. I understood who I was working for. And that changed how I went about my business. Regardless of what I was being asked to do. And the fact that it was in the summer, it was 90 degrees outside.

Conrad Harkrider  21:27
We need to remember that we are working not just for the guy that we're trying to impress so we can marry his daughter, but we are working for the Lord. If you have been hired to cut the grass, then you cut that grass like Christ Himself is the one that sitting on the porch. People in the world, they should want Christians to come and work for them. They should say, I know this is a guy, he's not lazy. He does his work. I know this lady, she is honest, she's trustworthy, she can be dependent on Jesus said in John chapter 17, in verse four, I have brought you goal or glory on earth, by finishing the work you gave me to do. Jesus was entrusted with work from the Father and, and certainly he understood the importance of fulfilling what God had given him to do. And so it is with us, in our everyday work, we should approach it with diligence with persistence, because we know that we're not just working for the company. If the company goes away, that's fine. We are serving the Lord. I want to say just a quick side note, I don't think this means that we have to be the number one salesman in the district, or that I need to be the last person in the office every night working the most hours because I'm serving the Lord. They're certainly balanced here. We think about other priorities in our lives. But when someone looks at my overall approach, and my attitude and my demeanor at work, they should say I need more people like that I would hire another person just like that. We labor for the Lord. Also, when no one is watching, look at what verse six says. He says not with eye service as men pleasers but as Bond servants of Christ doing the will of God from the heart. He says not with eye service as a men pleaser what is eye service that's offering service or work only when someone's eyes are upon you when someone is watching you or you're being observed? What is our look our work look like when the boss is standing right next to us? Are we busy? Are we productive? are we collaborating with other people at the company where I work? It's not uncommon for the executives to walk the floor. They'll come around and they'll stop at your desk and shake your hand and say hello and chat for a few minutes. And whenever that starts, when on the day when that happens, we're like little canaries we just did you see us on the floor and we're ironing and letting everybody know to be ready. No one wants to be caught playing a game on their phone watching a video when the boss comes around. But does our our level of effort change based upon who is watching? Based upon who is standing near me or do I put in the same amount of energy and effort into my job regardless of who sees me? You know, Daniel is a great example of someone who was consistent throughout his life Life. We see him in his public affairs. He was honest, he was acted with integrity, he was faithful to God, in his private life, we see him. He was devoted to the Lord, He prayed on a regular basis. And when the officials are the King were trying to find something against Daniel, they were looking for anything to try to dig up some dirt on him. They looked into every aspect of his life, and they couldn't find anything with the same thing be true of me, if someone looked at my work, when I'm in the office, or out of the office, or when I'm with people or by myself, would it be consistent across the board. Finally, the these men, they just said, Well, we just have to make up a new law. That's the only way we can pin Daniel, because we know that he is going to act the same way, as he has before.

Conrad Harkrider  25:57
Are we the same person when we are being watched? Or do we slip into habits of of laziness, when no one is around, we need to remember that the Lord sees the things that we do. And finally, when laboring for the Lord, we need to consider that he ultimately will repay. Look at verse eight. It says, knowing that whatever good anyone does, he will receive the same from the Lord, whether he is slave, or free. At the end of verse nine, he says, There is no partiality with him. He will repay when this is directed towards the slaves, it's meant to be an encouragement to them, it's meant to strengthen them to give them some sense of hope. When it's directed towards the Masters, it's meant to be a warning, don't mistreat or harass the people that are under than that are under you, because you to have a master maybe there's some parallels today with those who are in positions of management or if you own your own company, not to intimidate or take advantage of the people that are under you, because you to have someone that is over you, the Lord is the one that that we that we ultimately are responsible to let this idea of repayment to the slaves is, is supposed to encourage them. It's that even if no one appreciates the work that we do, even if no one takes notice of our attention, our honesty, our the respect that we show to other people that we work with showing genuine interest in the lives of others, not just surface level, even if no one sees those things, ultimately, God is going to reward his people, God is going to set the record straight. If you never get a promotion or never move up the chain. One day God will reward his people. There have been horrible abuses that have taken place with workers that have been killed and many plate in many cases or injured because of employers that have acted recklessly. But God's going to take care of those who are serving them. And we can have confidence and assurance to know that this is the right way to go about it. We don't have to try to defend ourselves, fight for our own rights, cross the lines or do things that are unethical, because ultimately God will reward his people. They will receive their due from the Lord. I just want to emphasize as we close that what you do Monday, through Friday, whatever your work may be that is just as important as what you're doing right now, as what we do on Sundays. You are serving the Lord in your job as much as you are when you teach a Bible class or when you go and visit someone who is sick. And that's why it is so important for us to think about these things about how we conduct ourselves. Because people are noticing people are watching us we are setting an example to those around us. We are living the gospel day today. And we are working not just to make money or to advance our careers but ultimately we work in service to the Lord. In Colossians chapter three, in verse 23, it says, Whatever you do, work heartily as for the Lord and not for men, knowing that from the Lord you will receive the inheritance as your award. You are serving the Lord Christ. What we work for ultimately is is not a gold watch for years of service. It's not For the bonus, or the big paycheck, we are striving to receive an inheritance from the Lord. Something that can't be measured in dollars and, and and in benefits. This is something that is eternal that cannot be touched. We are serving the Lord Christ. Have you committed every aspect of your life to serving the Lord? Not just what you do on Sunday mornings, but throughout the week, have you devoted all of your effort in service to God? If you haven't started that walk with Christ, we want to encourage you to take that first step to become a Christian, by submitting yourself to God, putting on the Lord Jesus Christ through baptism, and begin to walk this new life in service to God if there's something that we can do to encourage or help you in that in that path. Please come down to the front as we stand and seeing you
