Good morning. It's good to see everyone here today. It's good that we have an opportunity to come together to worship and praise our God. appreciate so much the opportunity to do that with you. Continually. I don't know if impressed is the right word but appreciative of the men that we have lead in the assembly appreciate Dave's talk, you can tell he put effort into that appreciate the songs that Jerry's lot led to, to direct our minds. Our goal here at Broadmoor is to give God glory and praise and all that we do. And so I appreciate when when the men that I see come up here are focused on that, that goal and that intent. If you're visiting with us, we want you to know you're our honored guest. We're glad that you're here with us to study from God's word at this time. If you would open your Bibles to Acts chapter eight, Acts chapter eight.

Jeremy Sweets  01:02
The book of Acts tells the history of the spread of the church in the early days, and so it was after Christ had risen from the dead. In fact, in Acts chapter one, we see the resurrected Christ as He ascends back to heaven. Now the mission is with the apostles and the disciples as they go about spreading God's word throughout all creation. And so we see an explosion of of interest of people seeking and searching. We see preaching and proclamation of the gospel of Jesus Christ. And we see this in many different places. And Acts chapter two, the Bible says that there were 3000 men that were saved on that day, as you keep going into Acts chapter five, you see 5000 individuals. And so you see the church spreading and growing. And Acts chapter eight, you see that the gospel was spread to the Samaritans as well. And you'll see later in Acts chapter 10, as it goes to, to the Gentiles. The next chapter eight, I want to notice a case of conversion and a text that they were looking at, and Acts chapter eight and verse 26. Acts chapter eight and verse 26. Next chapter eight, I mentioned that the Samaritans were preached to but you'll notice that that saw was an individual that was persecuting the church. And so that led to a scattering of those that were persecuted. But that also led to preaching that went about as they were scattered. Phillip was one man that preached the Samaritans and then he had south to the row between Jerusalem and guys. And you're gonna see that this would have been after a worshiper was leaving there. This was an Ethiopian unit making his way from Jerusalem, back home, presumably. So if you would notice with me in Acts, chapter eight and verse 26, says, but an angel of the Lord spoke to Philip saying, Get up and go south, the road that descends from Jerusalem to Gaza. This is a desert road. So he got up and went, and there was an Ethiopian unit, a court official of Canada's queen of the Ethiopians who was in charge of all her treasure, and he had come to Jerusalem. He had come to Jerusalem to worship, and he was returning and sitting in his chair and was reading the prophet Isaiah. Then the Spirit said to Philip, go up and join this charity. Philip ran up and heard him reading Isaiah the prophet and said, Do you understand what you are reading? And he said, Well, how could I unless someone guides me and he invited Philip to come up and sit with him. Now the passage of scripture which he was reading was this, He was led as a sheep to slaughter and as a lamb before it Shira is silent. So he does not open his mouth, and humiliation, his judgment was taken away, who will relate his generation, for his life is removed from the earth. You notice that as Phillip comes upon this individual, he was reading the Word of God.

Jeremy Sweets  04:18
Philip, as a preacher would have been eager to talk to others about the Word of God. And here's a man that was reading God's word. And so he has an opportunity as their past cross directed by the Spirit to proclaim the gospel message. Well, I want to look at in particular, the passage that they were looking at here in Acts chapter eight. And that passage, looks back to Isaiah. So we're using Acts Eight, but we're going to be jumping back to Isaiah quite a bit. And so the first thing we'll notice is that this was a reading from Isaiah. It even mentions those exact words there in the text in verse 28, ached says that he was reading from the prophet Isaiah and mentioned that again in verse 30. And even ask if you understand what you're reading. And then he points to the passage and this is a quotation from Isaiah chapter 53, verses seven, and eight, where he says that He was led as a sheep to slaughter. Do you understand this passage? Well, this is a passage that we re, in fact, will often read it for the Lord's Supper, as we reflect upon that, and the Lord, that's a passage, I would just want to look a little bit more in depth in. So we'll notice that this is one of the Servant Songs. There's a handful of selections from Isaiah that some students have said, these are related in their theme in their message, and they're related to this servant, this suffering servant. And so as we look at the songs, there's four that identified although this is not the only place and Isaiah that talks about the servant, but in Isaiah 42, one through four and 49, Chapter 50. And, and also, for the most part, chapter 53. We see those four Servant Songs. And this is what the Ethiopian Eric was was reading. Now it quotes those two verses, but I believe he was likely or had been reading more than those two verses. And so we're going to consider as well this context. So if you want to go back to Isaiah, chapter 42. And I'd like to read through these songs or these selections of Scripture, and make some comment.

Jeremy Sweets  06:44
First of all, Isaiah 42, verses one through four, Behold my servant to my uphold my CHOSEN ONE in whom I sold the lights, I have put my spirit upon Him, He will bring forth justice to the nations, he will not cry out or raise his voice, nor make his voice heard in the street. A bruised reed he will not break in a dimly burning wick, he will not extinguish he will faithfully bring forth justice, he will not be disheartened or crushed until he's established justice in the earth in the coastlands will wait expectantly for his law. I'll mention that in the prophets, there's often a message of judgment and a message of hope. Often, that's a short message of hope. But in Isaiah it's prolonged chapters 40 through 66, through the end of the book, is a message of hope. So it comes within that context. So that's the first servant song that we see in Isaiah 42. Notice in chapter 49, Chapter 49. verses one through six. Listen to me, oh islands and pay attention you peoples from afar. The Lord called me from the womb, from the body of my mother, he named me, he has made my mouth like a sharp sword in the shadow of his hand, he has concealed me. And he has also made me a select arrow, he has hidden me in his quiver. He said to me, You are my servant Israel, and whom I will show my glory. But I said, I have toiled in vain I've spent much spent my string for nothing and vanity, yet surely the Justice due to me is with the Lord, and my reward is with my God. And now says the Lord who formed me from the womb, to be a servant, to bring Jacob back to him so that Israel might be gathered to Him, for I'm honored in the sight of the Lord and my God is my strength. He says, it is too small a thing that you should be my servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob and to restore the preserved ones of Israel. I will also make you a light of the nations so that my salvation may reach to the end of the earth. In Isaiah 50. Starting in verse four, we see the third servant Psalm.

Jeremy Sweets  09:17
Isaiah 50, verses four through nine. The Lord has given me the tongue of disciples that I might know how to sustain the weary one with a word. He awakens me Morning by morning, he awakens my ear to listen as a disciple, the Lord God has opened my ear and I was not disobedient, nor did I turn back. I gave my back to those who strike me and my cheeks to those who pluck out the beer. I did not cover my face from humiliation and spitting. For the Lord. God helps me therefore I'm not disgraced. Therefore, I've set my face like flint, and I know that I will not be ashamed. He who vindicates me as near who will contend with me, let us stand up to each other, who has a case against me, let him draw near to me, Behold, the Lord God helps me, who is he who condemns me, behold, they all wear out like a garment, the moth will eat them. And so we see in this third servant song, a message of the prophet Isaiah. Now, I want to stop there, the last song, and we'll look at that in a little bit is the longest of the four. And it's probably the most well known passage, but I just want to stop just looking at those first three and reflect on some themes that we've seen out of this passage. Okay, so some of these things include talking about the servant and his relationship to God, the servant and his relationship to God. You notice in the very first song in chapter 42, and verse one, he says, Behold, my servant, whom I uphold my chosen one, in whom my soul delights, this servant would be truly a servant of the Lord, chosen by God. Why do you'll see in the next song, in verse and chapter 49, that it was that way from his birth, from the womb, He was chosen to be the servant of God, this servant would be one that God, God helped and aided in his struggles, this servant would be one that God delighted in and rejoiced in his activity. So the first thing we see as we read through these songs is this servant is truly a servant of the Lord of the Lord. Notice also you'll see his mission in the text in chapter 42, and verse one. His mission includes going to the nations, he says, I will put my spirit upon Him He will bring forth justice to the nations. You remember that Isaiah was a prophet to Israel, and, and to Judah. And so as he spoke to the people of the Covenant, here, he's saying that the servant is going to bring justice to the nations. Again, in verse four of chapter 42. He says he will not be disheartened or crushed, until he is established justice in the earth. The mission of the suffering servants would be to bring justice to all nations. But not only that, in chapter 15, he says he would also restore, excuse me chapter 49.

Jeremy Sweets  12:41
He says that he would also restore Israel, bring back Israel. And so there's really a two fold mission. Notice in 49, verse five, and now says, The Lord who formed me from the womb, to be a servant, to bring Jacob back to him, so that Israel might be gathered to Him. In verse six, he says, Is it too small thing that you should be my servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob and to restore the preserved ones of Israel, the mission of the suffering servant would be to bring justice to all nations, but also to restore Israel. We even see this further that Israel would function in that as we keep reading in verse six, I will also make you a light of the nations so that my salvation may reach to the end of the earth. And so we see the goal always of God's choosing Israel, so that he would be able to bless all people, you remember the promise made to Abraham in Genesis chapter 12, that in Hill, all families of the earth would be blessed, God shows individuals, he chose a path for his his blessings to come about. But ultimately, his goal was that all people would receive those blessings, all people would have an opportunity to be saved. And so we see this suffering servant is bringing that mission about restoring Israel, and bringing justice to the nations. You also see that this servant would persist in suffering. So he would suffer and the text makes note of that several different places. For example, in chapter 50, in that third servant song, he says in verse six, I gave my back to those who strike me and my cheeks to those who pluck out the beard. I did not cover my face from humiliation, and spitting. For the Lord God helps me therefore I am not disgrace. Therefore, I've set my face like fit Flint, and I know that I will not be ashamed. He who vindicates me is near. We see earlier in that passage also that despite this suffering this the servant would be obedient. The servant would persist in the suffering, the suffering would not be something that that causes him to fail, the suffering would not be a stumbling block, the suffering would not keep him from his mission, he would continue to be obedient. And so we see these themes as they come up again and again in these songs, and really, elsewhere in Isaiah as well. So with that in mind, let's look a little bit further at Isaiah 5213, through the end of 53. Here's the fourth servant song, Isaiah 5213

Jeremy Sweets  15:40
through the end of 53, in verse 12. And I'll just throw a quick outline up here. And so you're gonna see some repeated themes in this last song. Some of those themes deal with suffering, the servant would be one that suffers, but you also see in in greater length in greater detail, that the suffering servant would suffer vicariously, meaning he would suffer on behalf of others, he would suffer for others, I don't think we've been introduced as much to that point, as we are certainly here. But not only vicariously, but victoriously. The servant would not stumble at his suffering, the suffering would not be a stumbling block, the suffering would not be something that gets in the way that he has to overcome. But the suffering would be the means by which he would accomplish his mission. It would be the means by which he would accomplish his purpose. And so we see with this suffering song, five different sections here, and you may be tired of me talking about chiasm. But there seems to be a chiasm there are couplets on the outside talking about his exultation, suffering would not lead to his downfall, but he would be exalted, then in greater detail, detail talks about his suffering, but really was pertinent is that central section I believe, what is emphasized is the significance of the suffering. I believe that that's a little bit new. I want to read starting in verse 1352, and make comment on each one of these sections. 5213, Behold, my servant will prosper, he will be high and lifted up and greatly exalted. Just as many were astonished at you, my people. So his appearance was marred more than any man, and it's far more than the sons of men. Thus, he will sprinkle many nations, King will shut their mouths on account of him for what had not been told them, they will see in what they had not heard, they will understand. Here you see again, my servant will prosper, my servant will be exalted, and he'll do that in the midst of his suffering. We often see suffering as something that stands in the way of accomplishing the goal. It's something that distracts and detracts from what is intended to happen. But here the servant will be exalted, even while he is more, even while he suffers. In chapter 53. verses one through three, you see a detailing of the suffering to take place. Chapter 53 And verse, one who has believed our message, and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed? For he grew up before him like a tinder chute, and like a root out of parched ground, he has no stately former majesty that we should look upon him, nor appearance that we should be attracted to him. He was despised and forsaken of men, a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief, and like one from whom man hide their face, He was despised, and we did not esteem Him. In verse two, it says that he grew up before him like a tinder shoot. A very new growth, you might have expected to see this giant oak representing

Jeremy Sweets  19:18
the servant here, the one that would come that would bring justice to the earth and restore the Israel back he would function like a giant tree mature tree, but that's not what the text says. In fact, that that giant tree in essence had been cut off because of the wickedness we see out of Israel. And you see that in chapters, chapters one through 39 judgment would come upon Israel, they were not living up to the expectation of what they were supposed to be. And see here as you see this stump that is brought forth from from Israel, you see, a new growth, a tinder shoot. If you were to Look at that you would you would this count that disregard that's nothing special that there's nothing strong and oak, you know, oak like and there's no strength in that. But that's how this servant would come about was nothing special to look at. And the text goes on to say that he would did not look like King Saul, you remember King Saul, head and shoulders above the rest. If you're look out and say, Where's the king, you say that's the king. You know what you can just tell you can look at him and tell he looks like a king. Well, you wouldn't look at this servant and say that he's special. You wouldn't look at him and say, you know, he needs to be the first pick when playing football. He's not the one that's going to win the contest. He's not the one that's going to be noticed. He's not the one that looks like a king. He goes on to say in verse three, not only is he nothing special or attractive or kingly to look at, but he would be despised and forsaken of men, a man of sorrows. That phrase makes me stop. For someone to be described as a man of sorrows is not someone that has occasional sorrow, or someone that has a little bit of sorrow, but here you see their life, or they are described as is a man of sorrows, acquainted with grief. And like one from whom men hide their face, He was despised, this servant would be despised, and yet we have to keep reminding ourselves what this servant would do. So this is not making sense. If we're reading this, this victorious servant is the suffering servant. This victorious servant is one that's not special. But we just talked about a special mission. This servant would bring goodness to all people but be despised by all people. That doesn't make sense to me. But that's the servant that we're talking about. Now in verses four through six, I believe this is the central point of this passage. And it stands as unique for, at least from what we've seen from the other songs. In verse four. Surely our griefs He Himself war and our sorrows He carried, yet we ourselves a steamed him, stricken, smitten of God and afflicted, but he was pierced through for our transgressions, he was crushed for our iniquities, that chastening for our well being fell upon him, and by His scourging we are healed. All of us like sheep have gone astray. Each of us has turned to his own way, but the Lord has caused the iniquity of us iniquity of us all to fall on him. His suffering would be vicarious, or it would be on behalf of others. It was not from what he had done. Notice the text underscores this time and time again in verses four through six. It says that, it was our griefs, our sorrows that he carried. He was smitten of God and afflicted, but he was pierced through for our transgressions. He was crushed for our iniquities, by His scourging we are here. Verse six, we have gone and sheet, we have gone like sheep. We try this again. All of us like sheep have gone astray. We've turned to his own way, but the Lord has caused the iniquity of us all to fall on him. The suffering servant is suffering with the weight of the sin of others on him. He is suffering as he takes upon what seems to be deserved for other people.

Jeremy Sweets  23:59
This suffering servant is suffering on behalf of others. In verses seven through nine, we see another detailing of the suffering. He was oppressed and He was afflicted, yet he did not open his mouth, like a land that has led to slaughter and like a sheep that is silent before it seers so he did not open his mouth. By oppression and judgment, He was taken away and as for his generation, who considered that he was cut off out of the land of the living, for the transgression of my people to whom the stroke was due. His grave was assigned with wicked men, yet he was a rich man and his death, because he had done no violence, nor was there any deceit in his mouth. Here we see this suffering servant does not protest. He does not proclaim his innocence. But instead he suffers in silence. And verse eight. By oppression and judgment he was taken away, you see that the suffering In the detail of the suffering begins to increase. Not only that he's suffering his life but the text points to his death. In verse eight, he was cut out of the land of the living. And verse nine, his grave was a son with wicked men. He was with a rich man and his death, because he had done known violence, nor was there any deceit in his mouth, this suffering servant would suffer on behalf of other people. And it would even result in his life in his life being taken. And he did that in silence. And he did that in innocence. In verses 10 through 12, we see a statement of exaltation as it mixes with the other messages of suffering and the significance. Verse 10. But the Lord was pleased to crush him, putting Him to grief if he would render himself as a guilt offering. He will see his offspring he will prolong his days and the good pleasure of the Lord will prosper in his hand. As a result of the anguish of his soul, he will see it and be satisfied by his knowledge, the Righteous One, my servant will justify the many as he will bear their iniquities. Therefore, I will allot Him a portion with the great and will divide the booty with the strong because he poured out Himself to death, and was numbered with the transgressors, he got himself for the sin of many and interceded for the transgressors. Now, if I'm reading through this, and I see that in verses eight and nine, it mentions his death, his grave, I began to think that well, that must be the end of his mission. In fact, that would stop him from accomplishing his mission, but not so in verse 10. The Lord was pleased to do this, because it was in the crushing of the servant that the, the mission would be brought about, says that he would render himself as a guilt offering goes on to say he will see his offspring he will prolong his days, the one that had die mention of his death, the one that would function as an offering, again, mentioning his death, the text says that he will prolong his day. And so I begin to scratch my head some more. Because everything I know about when someone dies, that's the end of their work. But yet, we see that the text says that despite his suffering, or because of his suffering, he bore the sin of many and interceded for the transgressors. Well, those are the Servant Songs, you're going to see that the unic asks a question. Now, who is this talking about? And that's an important question to ask. In Acts chapter eight. I mean, just read the verse associated with that in verse 34. The UNIQ answered Philip and said, Please tell me of whom does the Prophet say this of himself, or of someone else? So who is this one that we're talking about in Isaiah? Who is this servant? Well, there's a few different answers to that, for example, in Isaiah, a handful of passages and identifies Israel, as my servant, Israel, My servant, notice and 43, or excuse me, find my place here. 49 is the one I want. 49 and verse three.

Jeremy Sweets  28:49
He said to me, You are my servant, Israel. You are my servant, Israel. And you can see says this in several different places. Now Israel had been his servant. Is this the servant that he's talking about? Is he talking about the nation? Well, even that begins to provide some difficulty when they think about Israel and the suffering that they experienced. After they came back from exile. Maybe it's representative of that. But if you keep going, and Isaiah 49, and notice verse five, and now says, The Lord who formed me from the womb, to be His servants, to bring Jacob back to him so that Israel might be gathered to Him. So here's it talks about the servant we already saw that there was some mention of Israel. But now he says that the servant is going to bring Israel back, going to bring Israel back. And you'll notice in chapter 42, and 49, that that first person language is used. And so we began to think about well is Isaiah here the servant because he uses pronouns like me, you know, and now the Lord says who for me From the womb to be his servant. And all throughout the number two and number three song you see this first person language? So is he talking about Isaiah? And that's what? That's exactly what the unic acid? Who is he talking about here? Is this is this Isaiah the prophet? And you can understand his confusion. As you read through this read through the prophecy. Well, there's another option and I have some verses highlighted, but it's really just from understanding the whole whole context. Or does this refer to the Messiah someone yet future because of the mention of the fact that Israel would be brought back because of the statement of justice being extended to all the earth? Because what we see in chapter 52 And verse 653, verse six, all of like sheep have gone astray, each of us has turned to his own way, but the Lord has caused the iniquity of us all to fall on him. The scope here seems to be expanding, the idea seems to be something yet future. The idea seems to be something total, in its expanse, what it's trying to accomplish. And so we see even in verses 10 and 11, halfway through verse 11, he mentions, by his knowledge, the Righteous One, my servant, the Righteous One, my servant will justify the many. And so we begin to see this great work that is to be accomplished something yet future, something expansive in scope. Well, that's what the unit, is he talking about himself? Or is he talking about someone else? Well, the answer that comes from Philip, in Acts, chapter eight, Acts chapter eight. And verse 35, and Philip opened his mouth and beginning from this scripture, he preached Jesus to him. The ESV says, And Philip opened his mouth and beginning with the Scripture, he told him the good news about Jesus, Philip is going to answer the question, in no uncertain terms, the Servant Songs, and Isaiah is pointing to Jesus Christ. And if we were to go back and look at all the details, we see that Jesus accomplished these things in his suffering, and his suffering and in His death, as he was a guilt off, as he was put up for the sins of others. And that would seem to be the defeat of him. In fact, you will remember after he was put to death on the cross, how did the disciples look? They're downcast, they were distressed, they had lost. They didn't understand that Jesus Christ would be exalted, and that in his suffering that would accomplish his mission, not just for Israel and bringing Israel back, but for all the nations and for all the people.

Jeremy Sweets  33:23
You'll notice also that Philip doesn't just talk about Isaiah, at least in my understanding, he seems to use Isaiah as a springboard, and that is that he began with that scripture, but he talked about other scriptures. Now he could have made his case from Isaiah alone. We'll see in Luke chapter 24, that Jesus says, and beginning with Moses and all the prophets, He interpreted to them and all the scriptures, the things concerning Himself. Jesus doesn't say that it's said about Jesus. And so we see that not only Isaiah, but really all of the Old Testament is looking forward to and pointing to this, Jesus, this suffering servants. Now the passage is well known for a reason Isaiah 53, there is so much we can learn from that text. The point I want us to get to see and understand this morning is that he is pointing to se they look at Isaiah that is pointing to Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ accomplished those things in his death. Now you get the privilege, or you have to put up with me preaching tonight. So I'd like to look a little bit further at some of those connections tonight. But the point I want you to see this morning is that this passage is pointing to Jesus Christ. And furthermore, I want you to see what Philip did with this and what the unit did with this after seeing the message. He says that this was the good news about Jesus. This was the gospel. And so he pointed to those fundamental passages of Jesus mission of his suffering of his service to God. And he said that he did that for you and for me, for us all. He told the eunuch about that as well he began from that prep passage and he preached to him the good news, because it is good news what Jesus accomplished his greatness, He bore our sins on the cross, He died for us. We see Furthermore, that as he preached to him, Jesus, they came upon some water. And the unit knew that the gospel message was not just an academic exercise where you just fill your head with some facts and walk away and, and you're happy with that. But rather, the gospel message demands a response. The good news of Jesus Christ demands a response. So when he came upon water, he says, What prevents me? He didn't say, Do I have to do that? He said, What prevents me? You see his eagerness. When a message like what we see in Isaiah 42 4950 and 53, when that message is presented to us, our holy response is one of eagerness and gratitude. Where can I do this? Where can I have access to this suffering service? Where can i What can I do in order to be a part of this? And that was the attitude of the UNIQ. And he saw water, he said, What prevents me from being baptized? And so baptism is a case where you are buried with Christ, and raised to walk in newness of life, how can I have access to that savior, you can be buried with him. And that was the message I believe that Philip gave to the unit. And what's so great about that message is that the good news is still here today. Jesus Christ died for you and for me, He bore our sins, and we may live after the fact. But he still died for you and for me, and we can do exactly what Philip did. What the unit did, well, him do it filmed it too and go about preaching. But the unit was eager to obey, to submit himself in baptism giving his life over so that he would be buried, he would die with Christ and that He would be raised to walk in newness of life. If there's someone here this morning and you're not a Christian, you have that same opportunity. If you're here this morning and you are a Christian, you're not living as you should you also have the opportunity to make your life right this very, this very, there's anybody subject to the invitation, please come as we stand and sing at this time.
