Good evening. It's good to see everyone here tonight, it's been a beautiful day to be able to sing praises to God to be able to meet with fellow saints and, and pray and partake of the Lord's Supper. It's always good when we can be reminded and directed into what is most important. And we do that in worship. I love the songs that we're able to sing Hosanna, Jesus died and rose again. And I heard a lot of kids, Rayleigh was behind me, shouting that and it was beautiful. It was very, very good. This morning, we looked at the subject of the Servant Songs from Isaiah. And so this is the passage that the Ethiopian eunuch was reading when he came upon Philip, or when Philip came upon him. And he asked him about that. And so they go back, and they look at those things and read those things together. And he asked the question, Who is this about? Is he saying this about the prophet or about someone else? was Isaiah saying this about himself? Or was he looking to someone else? And we see there that Philip tells him in chat, Acts chapter eight, and verse 35. He says, he says, the text says, but getting with the Scripture, he told him the good news about Jesus, the answer to that question is that text was referring to Jesus Christ. And so it's a wonderful passage that encapsulates really the gospel message. And so I hope this is not too much of a repetition. But I'd like to just take some passages and show exactly where those match up with Jesus tonight. And so we'll be repeating some of the things we looked at, but explicitly talking about where they are fulfilled in Jesus Christ. So we'll be continuing our subject of Jesus, the suffering servant, Jesus, the suffering servant. And we see that, as he mentioned there, he says, beginning with this scripture, he told him about Jesus. So we're going to look at the Old Testament scripture, and then compare that to what we see, of Jesus. The first thing when we look at the text of the suffering servant is we see that there is a servant that is talked about the passages of the Servant Songs we looked at started with Isaiah 42, verses one through four. And that first passage says, Behold, my servant, the last servant saw, it also begins in that way, Behold, my servants, My servant, there he is talking about my servant, we see that Jesus Christ fits this description. He was the servant, and Mark 10, verse 45, as he was talking to his disciples about the first shall be last and last shall be first. He says, For even the Son of Man came not to be served, but to serve, and to give his life as a ransom for many Philippians reflects upon this statement, or this idea of Jesus being the servant in Philippians, two and verse seven, it says, But he emptied himself by taking the form of a servant, being born in the likeness of men. Jesus Christ fits this description. All throughout his life, we see that he was a servant, He came to serve other people. And we can learn a lot from his example in that.

Jeremy Sweets  03:30
We also see that he was the suffering servant, the suffering servant. In Isaiah, we see that so much emphasis is placed upon the fact that this servant would be one that suffers and that he would accomplish the will of God through His suffering. Now that's completely contrary to what we're used to seeing today, we're used to seeing mighty rulers are those that that are not suffering, those that are in control of themselves that have all the power. But here we see that Jesus was going to accomplish the will of God through suffering through suffering. In Isaiah 53 And verse three, it says that he was a man of sorrow, and acquainted with grief. The very next verse goes on to say that he surely he has borne our griefs and carried our sorrow. So we see that Jesus was a man of sorrows, but in part that was because what he was doing for us, he was carrying our griefs, our burdens, our sorrows, Jesus was one that suffered. He did not have an easy life, but he lived a life of service to God. And the New Testament we see that this describes Jesus. For example, in Luke 24, in verse 46, says, Thus it is written that the Christ should suffer and on the third day rise from the dead. Jesus Christ as the scriptures talk about In Isaiah and elsewhere would be one that would suffer and rise again. We also see on First Peter chapter two and verse 21. For to this you have been called because Christ also suffered for you, leaving you an example so that you might follow in his steps. Remember that He bore our griefs, our sorrows, and he left us an example. For we see that he suffered in the right way as we'll notice even further in just a moment. We also see that Jesus was despised. Jesus was despised. It's such an odd thing to think about that Jesus Christ came to bring salvation to all people. Yet He was despised. Jesus came for the benefit of others, yet those same people that he loved and gave himself for, rejected him. The scriptures talk about this that Jesus was despised in Isaiah 53 And verse three. It says, For He was despised and rejected by men, and as one from whom men hide their faces He was despised, and we esteemed him not. That's what we find of Jesus Christ. In John one and verse 11. It says that He came to His own and His own people did not receive him. He was rejected even among his own people. And also in Mark 12 and verse 10. It says, Have you not read the Scripture, the stone that the builders rejected has become the chief cornerstone. And so we see that Jesus Christ again, fits this description of the suffering servant. He was one that was despised, he came to do good for others, but they rejected Him. That is the suffering servant, not the one hailed as a great king, not the one universally recognized as a great warrior, but the lowly servant. We also see that even though He was despised by men, he was pleasing to God. He was pleasing to God. And Isaiah 42 And verse one, the first of the Servant Songs, says, Behold, my servant whom I uphold my chosen, in whom my soul, the lines, the text points us to the fact that even though He was despised, my man, Jesus Christ was pleasing to his father. And Jesus or God, spoke this on more than one occasion, particularly as baptism and also at his transfiguration. And Mark 111 referencing his baptism, it says, In a voice came from heaven, you are my beloved son with you, I am well pleased with you, I am well pleased. Jesus wasn't one that impressed everyone else that saw him. But God was pleased with him. Certainly, there's a lesson there isn't perfect. Christians aren't going to please everyone, are they not going to please everyone around us, but that's really not what's most important. What's most important is that we would please our God.

Jeremy Sweets  08:08
We also see that Jesus Christ was obedient, obedient, the servant song talks about the servant, that would be obedient. In Isaiah 50, verses five and six, the Lord God has opened my ear, and I was not rebellious, I turned not backward, I gave my back to those who strike and my cheeks to those who pull out the beard, I hid not my face from disgrace and spitting. Now we see that Jesus Christ was innocent. We see that in Scripture, there was no no sin that could be charged to his account. There was no wrong that could be levied against him. Jesus was innocent in all things. But it's interesting that the Servant Songs in Isaiah as it points to Jesus Christ talks about his obedience in particular, and in relationship to his suffering. So yes, it's true that he did not commit adultery, he did not lie, do not steal or do any of those things. But here in Isaiah, what's especially mentioned is that he was obedient, despite his sufferings or in the face of his sufferings. And we see that revealed in the New Testament as well. For example, in Hebrews chapter five and verse seven. There it says, although he was a Son, He learned obedience through what He suffered. Jesus Christ did not allow his suffering to be a stumbling block or a hindrance to accomplishing the will of God. But rather, he continued on in first Peter to in verse 23. It says, When he suffered, he did not threaten but continued and trusting himself to him who judges justly. Jesus Christ was innocent, and he was obedient when it came to pleasing God, even in the midst of his suffering. He didn't allow His suffering to hinder him. In Matthew 26, verse 39, Jesus says, My Father, if it'd be possible, let this cup pass from me nevertheless, not as I will, but as you will, in the face of his sufferings, in the face of what was certainly to be a painful experience, Jesus asked that that be taken away from him. But once again, that was not his primary concern. It was not primarily concerned with himself, he wanted the pain to be lessened there. But his primary concern was the will of God, like God's will be done. And so you can see that even though he was suffering, he did not turn away from God. He did not use that as an excuse against God the Father. And it says that he submitted Himself to strikes and to to pain on behalf of the Father. And that's what we see in the New Testament. Jesus Christ was obedient, he was obedience. We also see that the suffering servant would be one that would die. Again, this is an odd thought that the one that would bring justice to all nations that would restore Israel was not a mighty warrior. He was not one that that would lead in greatness in those terms, but he was one that would die. And that very fact was a stumbling block to many people in the New Testament, as they heard about this one, what do you mean he would die. And when the disciples saw that he had died, they hung their heads because they felt like they had been defeated. Certainly, this is not how victory will be won. The suffering servant of Isaiah is one that would die. It says in Isaiah 53, verses eight and nine, and as for his generation, who considered that he was cut off out of the land of the living, and they made his grave with the wicked, and with a rich man in his death, this suffering servant would suffer even to the point of death. And that's exactly what Jesus did. In Philippians, two, in verse eight, it says, in being found in human form, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to the point of death, even death on a crawl. Jesus Christ fits the description that we see of the suffering servant. And that's why we can see Phillip saying that he began with this scripture in Isaiah. And he spoke to him the gospel about Jesus Christ.

Jeremy Sweets  12:38
And Isaiah 53, or really the first servant song, the first to Servant Songs, we see that the mission of the servant would be to bring justice to all nations to all people. In fact, we see in chapter 49, verse six, it says, it is to lie to thing that you should be my servant to raise up the tribes of Jacob and to bring back the preserve the visual, I will make you as a light for the nations that my salvation may reach to the end of the earth. You see what he's saying here? He says that it is not enough that my servant would be used to bring back Israel. Although he would accomplish the, he says there's more to be done. It will be a light to the nation so that salvation may extend the reach to all people. Jew engine time. I mentioned this morning, I'll mention it again. promises to Abraham in Genesis chapter 12. Was so that all families who the earth might be blessed through Abraham, God was never intending to restrict his blessings to a single nation. His goal was always to offer his blessings to all people. He simply chose a channel or group of people through which to accomplish that. And so we see that's what happened in Jesus Christ, he would bring salvation for all people. Paul argues this in Romans The first first few chapters are Romans, there is no distinction when it comes to the Jew and Gentile in terms of being a sinner. And Romans three in verse 22, he says, For there is no distinction, For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, and are justified by his grace as a gift through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus, whom God put forward as a propitiation by his blood to be received by faith. There is no distinction when it comes to being a sinner. both Jews and Gentiles stand condemned before God. There's not a single righteous man saved Jesus Christ, of course, that can stand before God innocence. And just in the same way as no man stands before God, innocent. All people also need Jesus Christ in order to be saved. Jew and Gentile They need the blood of Jesus Christ that was offered as a propitiation or a satisfaction for the guilt that is found in sin.

Jeremy Sweets  15:11
Furthermore, we see that his death was for sins, in Isaiah 52, verse 13, through 5312, that last servant song, most of the 53 in the couple of verses before that, we see that there are five sections there. And it's formed in sort of a chiasm. The outside two sections deal with exultation. You take a step in the next two sections deal with suffering and describe that suffering. And then verses four through six is really the heart of the servant song there. And that that section deals with the significance of the suffering. So notice, in Isaiah 53, and I'll go ahead and read verses four through six. Surely he has borne our griefs and carried our sorrows, yet we esteemed him stricken, smitten by God and afflicted, but he was wounded for our transgressions, he was crushed for our iniquities, upon him was the chastisement that brought us peace, and with his stripes we are healed. All we like sheep have gone astray we have turned everyone to his own way, and the Lord has laid on him the iniquity of us all. Jesus Christ's suffering was both vicarious and victorious, vicarious meaning that it was on behalf of other people. You see that all throughout that section there in verses four through six. There he says that it was for our transgressions for our iniquities. The chastisement brought us peace, through His stripes, we are healed, and all, All we like sheep have gone astray, we have turned everyone to his own way. And the Lord has laid on him the iniquity of us all. Jesus Christ are the suffering servant here suffered for other people. He suffered for the sins of other people. And so we see that he was vicarious in his suffering. Normally, suffering and death would have meant the defeat, but Jesus was victorious in those things, he accomplished his purpose through the suffering that was to take place. In first Corinthians 15, in verse three, Paul says, For I delivered to you as a first importance, what I also received, that Christ died for our sins in accordance with the Scriptures. That's where you see that Isaiah is so, so important. It really encapsulates and tells us the gospel message, and that gospel message is fundamental to the faith. In first Corinthians 15. And verse three says, this is a first importance. If you were to remove this element, you've removed our entire faith. Our faith rests upon is built upon what Jesus Christ did when he died on the cross for our sins. Jesus Christ is the answer to the sin problem. He is the answer to the sin problem. There is no other answer. There is no other option. There is no other way. But he's he's been graciously given to us for our sins. In Romans five verses six and then also verse eight. For while we were still weak at the right time, Christ died for the ungodly. But God shows His love for us and that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us. Christ died for us for our sins for our sins. And we need to remember that. Let me look at one final point and that is that Jesus Christ or the suffering servant is revealed in Jesus Christ was exalting in Isaiah 52, in verse 13, you remember that that final servant song has those last, that first and last section being exultation? 5213 through 15, and then 5310, through 12. And that verse 5213, he says, Behold, my servant shall act wisely shall be high and lifted up, and shall be exalted, shall be exalted.

Jeremy Sweets  19:39
We see in the New Testament and Philippians chapter two, verses nine through 11, that Jesus Christ was exalted. The death that he suffered on the cross was not the end, and it certainly was not a defeat. But because of Jesus humbling himself. The text says in Philippians two that therefore God has highly exalted Him, and bestowed on him the name that is above every name. So that's the name of Jesus, every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father. Many people in the lifetime of Jesus rejected Him, spit on him, would have nothing to do with him. But on the last day, the text says that he will be exalted and universally recognized as the great king that he is, every knee will bow, every tongue will confess, there'll be no option but to acknowledge his greatness. That's what God will do for him. Notice also in Isaiah 52, and verse 13, the language, I'll just bring this up, he says he shall be high and lifted in John that that language of being lifted up as you several times, sometimes in reference to the crucifixion, it was in the crucifixion as he was lifted up on the cross, that seemed to be defeat for many people or less what they thought it was. But in the cross is where we can gain the victory through Jesus Christ by having our sins washed by his blood, he was lifted up and even further, he was exalted when he was raised by God from the dead. And even further, we look forward to a day when all people will acknowledge his great name. And so we see in Philippians, two verses nine through 11, this truth? Well, again, that may be a little bit of a repetition from what we saw this morning, but I didn't feel like I had time to connect all those dots. And so I wanted to, to put those things side by side. And I didn't even touch the hem of the garment. There's a lot more to be studied in the Servant Songs are a wonderful passage for us to look at. But as we look through this list, look through the sinner list, we see that the suffering servant of Isaiah points us to one that would be a servant of the Lord, pleasing to the Lord shows and by the Lord, the Lord would help him, he would be one that suffered, He would be one that suffered in order to accomplish the very mission and the very purpose of God. That's so unusual, isn't it? Because usually suffering is the means or the way of defeat, but not for the suffering servant and not forgotten. That was God's means of victory. And so this suffering servant accomplished his mission through suffering, through humility, through lowering ahimsa. And it was his death, that functions as a sacrifice for us to have our sins washed away, wiped away. It may be that you're here tonight, and you're not a Christian. Philip points to this passage as the gospel, beginning with the Scripture, he preached to him the gospel of Jesus Christ.

Jeremy Sweets  23:06
This is the gospel message, that Jesus Christ left the throne of heaven, came to the earth and lived the life of a lowly servant, and he gave himself his life, and he gave himself in death for you for your sins, because of the iniquities that you have committed against God. iniquity and sin demands a price. And Jesus Christ paid that price. He gave Himself as a ransom for many Mark 10 and verse 45. We can only bow before God and praise His great name hosanna hosanna, Christ has died for us and been raised again. What a glorious message that is. And if you're here tonight, and you're not a Christian, you have an opportunity to obey that message. In Acts chapter eight, we see that the unit because he came upon water said what prevents me from being baptized, because when Philip preached to him about Jesus, he talked about being united with Jesus in baptism, by being immersed in water. And what that accomplishes is that is signifying are putting to death our sins, by the choice of our will, we're no longer going to live in that way. And we're raised to walk in newness of life, being buried with Christ in baptism, raise to walk in newness of life. If you're here and you're not a Christian, you have an opportunity to obey the message. If you're here tonight, and you are a Christian, you've made a lifelong commitment. And if you're not living as you should, you need to get back to that commitment. There is no time like now, in the Old Testament, in the first half of Isaiah one 340, we see that judgment would come upon the people of God because of their wickedness. The same will happen to us. We may be sitting in church pews, we may have our names in the role the membership of a church, but that doesn't mean that we're saying we must make a decision to live godly lives and if we're not doing that, make things right. This group here wants to do that. So we'll pray with you and for you and we want you to pray with and for us as we're all striving together to get to heaven. There's any subject to the invitation please come as we stand and sing at this time.
