Good morning, got everything together up here took me a second. It's good to see you today. It's certainly good that we have an opportunity to together together and worship. It's always important that we do that. It reminds us of what's truly important. As we go throughout the week, we tend to get wrapped up in the details of life and getting to our jobs and places we have to go. But it's good to stop and reflect upon God and what He has done. And so I appreciate the fact that I can worship with you this morning. It's a privilege to also be able to stand before you and preach the Word of God. It's important that we listen to God and His Word. And so I invite you to open up your Bibles with me, as I study this hour. We sang just a few moments ago. Why should I gain from his reward what Jesus Christ did for us? The song then said, I cannot give an answer. But this, I know with all my heart, His wounds has paid half paid my ransom. We still even 2000 years later grapple with the meaning of the death of Jesus Christ, and what that does for us. And in some ways, we're really no different than they were in the first century. When Jesus died on the cross, that message was proclaimed to the early to the world at that time, and those that accepted that message became part of the early church. I'd like to spend a few moments this morning looking at how that happened. In the book of Acts, we see that there are many conversions that take place and the record of many conversions. And we've been studying the book of acts on Sunday morning, usually I don't step on to something, someone's toes, it's talking about that. But Kurt gave me permission. And he encouraged me actually, he said, Go ahead, it will reinforce the message. So we're going to look at conversions in the book of Acts. And so there are nine conversions that we're going to look at this morning. And I'll not have time to read all of these accounts. I'll simply reference these and give a brief summary of what takes place. But I do encourage you to read the accounts on your own time. Or if you have any question, I'll try to get the details, right. But you may want to check with scripture to make sure that what I'm saying is according to God's word. So with that in mind, let us look at these conversions. Let us look at how the gospel was preached and how those that accepted the message became part of the early church. First of all, we find the Jews on Pentecost in Acts chapter two, this was shortly after Jesus's death. And we see that 40 days later he was exalted, or he was risen up, raised up to be with God. 50 days later, after that Sabbath in which Jesus was crucified, we find the day of Pentecost, and this was a Jew, a Jewish feast in which Jews from all over Palestine would gather together at Jerusalem. And on that day, we see that the Holy Spirit descended upon the apostles. And they began to speak in tongues and speak for the Word of God. Now that would have been needed, because remember that there were people from different nations there and different languages would have been needed. And so they spoke for the Word of God. Some people were confused at that time and said, These men must be drunk, why are they speaking like this? And, and Peter took the lead there and said, No, these men are not drunk, but they are fulfilling what was prophesied in the Old Testament that the Holy Spirit would be poured out. Peter then began to proclaim Jesus as the Christ. Jesus is the one that fulfilled the prophecies of the Old Testament. He is the one that dined, and was buried, but then he was raised according to the Word of God. Not only that, but then Peter says, this is the same Jesus that you crucified, and God has made Him both Lord, and Christ. Well, when he told the people there on that day that the text says that they were pierced to the heart. And they said, What shall we do? They were convicted of their sin. And they said, What shall we do? And Peter said, Repent, and let each of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of your sins, and you shall receive the gift of Holy Spirit. He said, Repent, and be baptized, and those that received the word that day were bad times, and there were about 3000 and number. So we see the preaching of the gospel message as it goes out to a great crowd. But it was not just a message that was interesting, or for news sake,

Jeremy Sweets  04:53
but it demanded a response. And so they said, What shall we do? And there was an answer given Yes, you need to do Do something with this gospel message. And so they repented. They believe that word, and they were baptized. And so we see the first example of conversion. Now in action, chapters three through seven, you're going to see the early church spreading. But you also see quite a bit of opposition to the church. Ultimately, in chapter seven, we're going to see one man is even put to death for preaching the gospel message. And that leads us into chapter eight will we'll see our next example of conversion. And Acts chapter eight, one of the men that was involved in the persecution was Saul of Tarsus. And he persecuted both, he, he went along with the murder of Steven and Acts chapter seven, but he also continued to persecute the church. And we see that as this persecution from Jerusalem, when out that the Christians spread out. And so one of the interesting things about that is as they went and spread out from that persecution, they went preaching the word of God. Philip was one of those that preach the Word of God. And it says, He came to the city of Sumeria. And he proclaimed Jesus as the Christ, He proclaimed to them, the Christ. And the text says that they paid attention to what he said, and the miracles that He did. And he was able to do those through the Holy Spirit. And that's interesting because they used to pay attention to something else. There's a man named Simon, and he was a magician of sorts. And I used to pay attention to him. But when they saw the gospel preached, the text says, they paid attention to that. And we see in verses 12 and 13 of chapter eight, when they believe Philip, as he preached the good news about the Kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized both men and women, and even Simon, that magician that they used to pay attention to even he believed, and was baptized. And he went along with Fila. The Gospel message was preached. And then we see a response that was the given to that gospel message. And that happened with Simon and the Samaritans. Well, Philip started to head back down south and God. We see there an angel instructed him to head not towards Jerusalem, but head further south as he came to this desert region. And so he came upon a man that was traveling from Jerusalem. This was an Ethiopian eunuch. So he had been going south from Palestine and headed, headed west toward toward Egypt and Ethiopia had been south of so headed back toward Africa. And he comes upon this Ethiopian eunuch, and he sees him and he's reading from the prophet Isaiah. He's reading from the scroll. And the text says that Philip runs to his chariot, and he hears him reading, and he asked him a question. Do you understand what you're reading? And so the Ethiopian eunuch says, How could I understand unless someone guide me and invites him into his chair it and it says that from that passage, he began to proclaim or preach to Him Jesus as the Christ. He preached the gospel message, and that had a profound impact upon him, he recognized he needed to do something. So as he came upon water, he says, What prevents me from being baptized? So as Phillip preached the gospel, preached about Jesus, He preached there the need to be baptized and to respond to that message. Well, Phillips, us, there's nothing that prevents you if you believe that Jesus is the Christ, and you may, and he announced his confession there. The text says that they both went down into the water, and they came up out of the water and he was baptized. And what did he do then? He rejoiced. He was excited, he was happy, his sins had been washed away. And so we see this the next example of conversion is this man, had the gospel preached to him and responded to the Gospel message.

Jeremy Sweets  09:26
Then we come to Saul of Tarsus. Now, we've already encountered him, haven't we? He was one of those that was persecuting the church. And he led to the scattering of those that went out from Jerusalem. We see that Saul of Tarsus was headed toward Damascus. It was about noon time, that as he went there, a bright light shone upon him. And you can imagine this was in the middle of the day, so that light had been brighter than the sun. It was an extremely bright light. And there was a voice that said and came to him and said, Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me? And he asked the question who? Who is this? In Jesus said, there I am Jesus of Nazareth whom you are persecuting. And then there's a third thing that Jesus told him, he said, Rise and go to Damascus, and you'll find a man named Anna NYAS. And he will tell you what you must do. And that's what he did. He went to the city of Damascus. And there he had been blinded from that bright light. And Anand is says, receive your sight. Receive your sight. You will be a witness, you've been selected in a nice telson to be a witness of these things. Then he told him Roz, and be baptized, and wash away your sins. Now that happens in Acts chapter nine. But Paul is going to be a main preacher in the book of Acts. And so he recounts that conversion again in chapter 22, and 26, and 26. So that's why we have those three examples there. And so he listened to the message and he went, and was baptized. And we see he went straight from there and began preaching and proclaiming Jesus as the Christ. Now what a change. He had been persecuting Christians, and now he's become one. So he had completely changed or converted to, to the gospel message, what a great sight to see.

Jeremy Sweets  11:31
And Acts chapter 10, we see Cornelius, he was a Cinterion, or a soldier in the Italian cohort, in chapter 10. And verse two says that he was a devout man, who feared God with all his household, gave alms generalist generously to the people and prayed to God continually. So we say that he was a good man, he was a believer in God, but there was something more that was needed. And an angel appears to him and tells him to call Simon Peter, call him. And so that's what he does, he calls Peter to himself. Now, Peter is going to proclaim the gospel to him, but first he receives a vision. See, before this time, the gospel had been spread among the Jews, and even gone to the Samaritans, but it had not yet gone to the Gentiles. And that seemed like something that was the way it was supposed to be to those early Jews. Maybe it's not supposed to go to the Gentiles. But Peter received a vision, and it was about dietary restrictions and laws. And he understood that God had made those things clean of the Old Testament. And he saw that he was supposed to preach the gospel to all people, including the Gentiles. And so that's what he did. He preached the gospel message to Cornelius and the Gentiles that were there with him. And as he began to proclaim the Word of God, the Holy Spirit fell upon them. And they were amazed because they said, even the Gentiles now received the Holy Spirit. It's not just the Jews in the neck chapter two, it's also the Gentiles. And this shows God's acceptance here. It's not just for the Jews, or the Samaritans easily, it is also for the Gentiles. And so the question was asked by Peter, can we prevent them from being baptized who've received the Holy Spirit? Can we hoard the gospel just for the Jews? Or the obedience of the gospel just for the Jews? And the answer was clearly no, this is to be opened up also to the Gentiles, as far as hearing the word and obeying and responding to the gospel message. And so we see that Cornelius and the Gentiles were obedient to the gospel, they were converted, and they were accounted what what had happened. And the news of that went out to other people, and they rejoiced that the Gentiles also were included among God's people. Then we come to Acts chapter 16. The next example of conversion. Now there are there are some other times when we know that disciples were made, for example, in Acts chapter 14, as Paul went on his first journey, says he went to Lister I conium, Derby, Antioch there and there were churches that were established there, and it says they made disciples. And so I'll point out this is not an exhaustive list of conversions. We know other things were happening among the people, they were being converted and becoming disciples, but these are accounts where we see the gospel being preached and how they responded. Okay. So then we come to Lydia. Now before we get to Lydian Philippon, we see that Paul was preaching and proclaiming the gospel and he intended to go into Asia. But the Holy Spirit told him not to go, maybe it was an angel, I have to look at that again, in Acts chapter 16, right before this passage, do not go into Asia, but rather go into Macedonia, go into Macedonia. And that's what he did. He went into flip pi. And he found a place beside the river. And he suppose that that would be a place where there would be a prayer service going on. And he spoke the gospel message. The Bible says that God opened up Lydia's heart, so that she listened to she heard what Peter, what Paul was saying there. And as she heard what he said, she responded to the Gospel message, she was baptized her whole household, and she says, if you found me to be faithful, then stay with me. And she prevailed upon them. But as God opened her heart, we see he did that through the preaching of the word. That's how that was accomplished. And she obeyed the gospel. She was a seller of purple. She was a prominent woman, again, a one that had feared God and was was obedient to what she knew and understood. But when the gospel was preached, she responded, and she obeyed. Next, we see that

Jeremy Sweets  16:27
Paul and Silas are still in flip II. In fact, they find themselves in a little bit of trouble. They preach the gospel message, and they come upon one that's selling these, these idols are making money from from this process. And so their message challenges that in the city gets up in an uproar, and they get thrown into prison. While they were in prison, they were not moping. They were not whining and crying about their plight, but the text says that about midnight, they were praying to God, and singing hymns to God, they were convicted and what they were doing, and those around them had heard what they were doing. Well, we see that an angel opens up, there's an earthquake and, and the doors swing open as they're in prison and their chains fall off. And Kurt talked about one of those opening of the prisons he talked about more, one of those is in Acts chapter 16. And so as that happens, the jailer, he's about to commit suicide, you see if any of his prisoners escaped, he would have been executed by his superiors. That was the way it worked, and the Roman military, so he was just getting a head start. If they've escaped, that, I'm going to kill myself. I don't want to have to face that punishment. And Paul speaks up and says, do yourself no harm. And he says, Sirs, what must I do to be safe. And it was at that time that Paul responded to him, Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved you and all your household. And the word was proclaimed. And he went, not a month later, not a year later, he went that very night, to be baptized, he responded to the Gospel message. And so we see that this jailer was converted. Next week, come to Christmas and the Corinthians and Acts chapter 18, Paul made a habit of when he went to a city, which he traveled around to many cities, he would often go into the synagogue and he would preach and proclaim Jesus there. And he used the Old Testament scriptures to provide evidence that Jesus was the Christ. And so that was his habit. And he would often spread out from there to those Gentiles that were there. Well, in Corinth, the Jews rejected his message, and he seemed to wipe his hands of the matter. And he says, I'm going to go to the Gentiles and preach and proclaim, now as message wasn't completely disregarded by the Jews, or as a man named Crispus, who was a leader of the synagogue, and he was it says that he believed and was baptized. And there were also Gentiles or Greeks that believed and were baptized. And so we see they were converted at Corinth in Acts chapter 18. Then we come to Acts chapter 19, we see the Ephesians from Corinth, Paul travel to Ephesus, and he found that says some disciples, and He inquired of these disciples, whether they had received the Holy Spirit when they believed, and they replied, we have not even heard whether there is this Holy Spirit they had not heard about Well, that leads him to his next question, well, then into one or two, who were you baptized, and they say we were baptized into John's baptism, they were unaware of what Christ had done. And they were unaware of what had happened there. And so Paul says, I'm going to tell you about who John was pointing to someone greater. And he proclaimed Christ to them. And they were baptized. And then Paul laid his hands on them, and they received the Holy Spirit, and they begin to speak in tongues, there as well. So we see a whole list of conversions. In the book of Acts, it's a common theme, tells about how the church spread, and this is how it happened, the preaching of the Word of God, and then people responded to it. And guess what they did when they responded, then they went out and preach the Word of God, and people responded to it. And you see how this cycle continued how the church spread, the the method of spreading the church has really not changed at all. We continue to preach and proclaim the gospel message people respond to it become devoted disciples, Christians, who then spread the gospel message. Well, I

Jeremy Sweets  21:19
want to notice a few things as we look at these conversions. And the first one is, I want to notice what God did what God did. God acted in some different ways. Here, there's some variety as far as how God approached this and what God did among them. And so we see that Holy Spirit came upon believers, Pawn believers. Now this happens actually, at different times. There's a promise that's given an X chapter two, that believe are Repent, and be baptized for the remission of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. When we come to the, the Gentiles and Acts chapter 10. It was before they believed and baptized that the Spirit came upon them, we see that the Holy Spirit allowed miraculous gifts. And sometimes this came at the laying on of the apostles hands. For example, in Acts chapter eight, we see that the apostles came to some area and they laid their hands on on some so that they might receive the Holy Spirit. They didn't receive it right after they were baptized, that took the apostles coming up and laying their hands on. Not only that, but one of them. Simon, did not receive miraculous gifts. And so apparently not every disciple automatically received the Holy Spirit upon the laying on of hands. In fact, he wanted to buy it. And he was rebuked for that. So Holy Spirit came upon believers, but it was in many ways, and many times there was not a uniformity there, I guess is the way that I would say that. Not only that, but we also see that the Holy Spirit directed the preacher, we talked about the believers and those that accepted but often the Holy Spirit directed the preacher in Acts, chapter two is the Holy Spirit came upon the apostles, they proclaim the Word of God. That was a message from the Holy Spirit from God Himself. In Acts chapter eight, Philip was directed where to go by there an angel, and he met the Ethiopian eunuch there. We also see in Acts chapter 16, as I mentioned, that Paul was prevented from going into Asia, but rather went to Macedonia. So he was directed where to go. Other times, we see that the one that would hear the gospel message, the god or an angel spoke to him, and not telling him what to do, but to call the preacher. We see the next chapter 10 With Cornelius, he was instructed not with a direct message from God as far as what to do or the gospel message, but he was told to call Peter, call the preacher to come to you. We see a similar case with Saul, when Jesus spoke directly to him. He says, You're persecuting me, go to Aina NYAS. And he'll tell you what you must do. And so we see the Holy Spirit or an angel or God, I probably should put those in there as well often directed the, the preacher and those that would be preached to as far as what they should do. And as I've mentioned before, the Holy Spirit enabled miracles and this took place in different ways and different times, some through the laying on of hands. We know from elsewhere in Scripture that there were different kinds of miracles. And not everyone received every portion of that, but it was spread out. And it was so that it might confirm the word and show that God was among his people. And so we see that with the Holy Spirit's also mentioned that God was at work, it says that he opened Lydia's heart, I believe the means of the method that he did that was through the preaching of the gospel. And Jesus also appeared to Saul. And so God is active in the book of Acts, and how he works and how he brings the things about it are not exactly uniform. But God is active. And I want us to see that. So now what is it that the human converts? What did they do? Well, here, I believe we find a little bit more uniformity, there seems to be a little bit more of a standard way that they responded to the Gospel message. And so I'd like to look at that for just a few moments. Now, this

Jeremy Sweets  26:03
is a chart that that I grew up with. I saw this for a long time growing up, I've reproduced it here. And I want to talk about few of these elements. The first thing that those that were converted did was they heard the word of God. In every case, they heard the word of God. And I want you to notice that the Holy Spirit is active, the Holy Spirit is involved God and Jesus, the Holy Spirit are involved. But never do they bypass the preaching of the Word, and mysteriously enter into someone's heart so that it might draw them or convert them. Never do they do that. They are active, but they do not bypass the word. Everyone heard the word preached, no one was converted apart from the word. And that word was something that could enter their hearts, and could convict and convince them. And so we see the word of God proclaimed, and what was that word? It was a message that Jesus Christ is die for you. Jesus Christ, there was news of that message. And it had implications and people were convicted, and convinced, acts to uses the language that they were pierced to the heart. So it's something that hit them. Now we do that today, don't we? If we're watching a movie, or we're hearing a message, it can stir our hearts can it when we realize the truth of that, or the implications of it, it can stir our hearts. And that's what the gospel message did. In Romans chapter 10, verses 14 through 17. It talks about the necessity of the preaching of the Word of God. It says this in verse 14, maybe it's 13, I can't remember here I have 14, you'll have to check me, for everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved. Then he says how they will they call on him in whom they have not believed? And how will they believe in Him whom they have never heard? And how are they to hear without someone preaching? And how are they to preach unless they are sent, as it is written, How beautiful earth feet of those who preach the good news, but they have not all obeyed the gospel? For Isaiah said, Lord, who has believed what he has heard from us. So faith comes from hearing and hearing through the word of God? How do people come to faith belief, it is through the preaching of the Word of God. And so the the set the necessary thing is that people would call upon God call out to Him for for help for deliverance. And so this passage asked the question, well, how can you get to that point, and it tracks it back. And it must start with a preacher being sent to proclaim the Word of God. And when you respond, you believe So faith comes from hearing and hearing from the word of Christ. Next, we see belief in almost every occasion, it specifically mentions that they believed. Now let me point out that I do not think that Saul and Lydia lacked belief. Sometimes the account summarizes or it it provides some detail, it doesn't go into every detail. So I'm just check marking where it says it explicitly. Okay. For example, in Acts chapter two, it doesn't say it right away. It says those that received the word talks about the fact they were pierced in heart, but it acts chapter two and verse 44. It says, Then those who believed and talked about their practice, and so we see that those people believed the gospel. It says the same thing of the Samaritans way they heard The preaching of the Kingdom of God and they believed the message. We see that for the Ethiopian eunuch, if you believe you may be baptized, and you can go down through the list, and we see that when they heard the message, it was not a message. They disregarded, but they believed it. They believed it. They believed it and they acted upon it. In fact, sometimes it doesn't mention belief, but that's understood. Because then they responded by by being baptized, would they be baptized without believing? I don't think there's any way that that you would be baptized without believing

Jeremy Sweets  30:41
the message. And so even when it doesn't mention that I think it's embedded within the text, okay, what they did, they heard, they believed, we also see that repentance was necessary. For example, in Acts chapter two, when they said, What shall we do when their hearts were peers? What did Peter say, Repent, and let each of you be baptized. Now, that is not mentioned. really often, it doesn't go into that. But that's embedded within the gospel message, it calls you to respond. And part of that response is leaving behind sin. The Bible makes it very clear throughout the rest of the New Testament, and really the Old Testament as well. God doesn't want us to serve Him with our lips, and have our hearts devoted to the world or to sin. He wants all of us, and that requires for those that are sinners to turn away from sin, to repent of that, and so it's not mentioned elsewhere. But in every case, I'd say, but it is part of the gospel message we see in Acts chapter 11. That is, they recounted the conversion of the Gentiles, Cornelius in the Gentiles. It says that God has granted to them repentance, that leads to live, they've been given an opportunity to repent as well see, the Jews needed to repent. But we also see that of the Gentiles in Acts chapter 11. So we see that they repentant confession is next as a come upon the the chart here. And this is one that there may be some question as far as his confession, something that occurs in the book of Acts, we see in Acts chapter eight. And if you're reading in your ESV, you may not find this verse, at least, I didn't, in the New American Standard that I checked, and I'm talking about x eight, verse 37, I believe, in the New American Standard, it's in parentheses. And so this is the place where Philip comes to water. And he says, What prevents me from being baptized, verse 37, says, If you believe you may, and he confess Jesus as the Christ. Now, not all the early manuscripts have that that's why the ESV remove that there's some question whether that is there. And so is it possible that this is not a part of the process? Is this not one of the steps that that's possible as we look at Acts, and I think elsewhere, we're gonna see the confession is necessary. And so maybe not. The words have to take place right before baptism, but as part of the Christian life, confession is necessary. And so this may be part of the life of the Christian after they're baptized, a continuing needed component. So I have a question mark in my mind there and confession, at least as it appears and acts if we're just looking at the conversions and acts. Notice in Romans chapter 10. It does talk about the necessity of confession. Romans 10 And verse nine. There, it says, because if you confess with your mouth, that Jesus is Lord, and believe in your heart that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved. For with the heart one believes and is justified, and with the mouth, one confesses, and is saved. And so we see the need for confession. Also, in Acts, chapter eight, verse 37, that would have been something that would have been likely to have been there practice. It didn't raise a lot of red flags, even if that was added by a scribe later, I don't think it was unusual to see a confession. So don't leave here and say, Jeremy said, we don't need to confess. No, Matthew said confession before men is necessary. And here Romans 10 says, confessing that Jesus is Lord is something you have to do in your heart. And so we see there the importance of believing in our hearts, but also having that come out of our mouth. confessing Jesus as the Christ. The next thing we'll notice is baptism.

Jeremy Sweets  35:06
Now in even belief, repentance, confession, it is not contained in every single example. But with baptism, you see that it is on every occasion and explicitly states that they heard the word of God, and that they were baptized. In every case, they were baptized. Notice that they were baptized as adults that made a decision to follow after God that heard the gospel message. And so they were not baptizing children or babies that not did not have the opportunity to hear and respond. You'll also notice that when they were baptized, they seem to do it right away. There was a sense of urgency. They did not put it off a month or a year and say, maybe I'll be baptized someday, I believe now. Well, maybe I'll be baptized someday. No, they were baptized. And we see the flippin jailer, it says, even the same hours the night, not at a convenient time, but at a needed time, right away. And so we see that they were baptized. And what that simply means is that they were immersed in water. They were immersed in water, and they came up out of the water. The Bible uses that imagery to talk about being raised with Christ. It uses that imagery to talk about washing away sins. And so we see what they did here. This is what the human converts did. Okay, they heard the gospel message believed repented of their sins, confess that Jesus is the Christ, and were baptized. So what are some things that we can learn from these conversions? I think we can learn a lot. The first thing I'd like to suggest is that that God is living and active. Some people think we even looked at the Sadducees, that, that believe that, that God is not active, there are no miracles, some people would say, God is not active in the world, maybe he created all things, but then he checked out. And that's not what we see, in the book of Acts, we see a living an active God, working among his people, I believe God is living and active today, we may not see the miracles, we may not see exactly what or how God works. But God is living and active today. God starts all of this. When we preach a gospel message, we're preaching about what God has done. So when we start thinking about how we should respond, we only are responding to what God has done, God initiated all of this. That helps us when we start to think about conversion, we're not patting ourselves on the back and say, Look how great I am. We are responding to what God has done. We'd have no hope ourselves, but responding to what God has done. God is living and active. In the in the book of Acts, we see that he often brought the person that needed the gospel message in contact with a preacher or one that would preach the gospel message. I believe God does that today. And I'm not going to tell you how or in every case what takes place, but God wants His Word, to come in contact with hearts today. That's what He desires. And I think that God can work in such a way to provide those opportunities. God is living in an active. The next thing I would say is that the Word of God is powerful. It is powerful. We see, for example, in Romans chapter one and verse 16, Paul says, the one that was converted in Acts nine, Paul says, For I'm not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power of God. To everyone who believes to the Jew first and also to the Greek. Gods word is powerful. It's powerful enough to change a person convert a person to take their sins and wipe those sins away. As they respond to the good news of Jesus Christ. It's powerful enough to change the vilest sinner, the one that if we were to categorize sin, the one that is so far gone, maybe a murderer, a persecutor. That's what Paul was. And he was converted. And he did that through the preaching of the Word of God. Hebrews four in verse 12, says, The Word of God is living and active, sharper than any two edged sword, just as God is living and active. So his word is and when We should listen to it.

Jeremy Sweets  40:03
Not only that, but we see that the gospel is for all. We see that the gospel was preached to Jews, we see that the first part of x, it went from there to the Samaritan Samaritans were a mixed race of Gentiles and Jews. And so it went to the Samaritan, they still had some Jewish blood in them, so to speak, the Jews thought it wouldn't go any further. But we see that the gospel was also for Gentiles. That's everybody. every nationality every people the gospel is for them. We say that the gospel message was preached to men, we see that the gospel message was preached to women, there was no discrimination based on gender. They did not say because you're a woman, you don't need the gospel. No, you need the gospel. If you're a man, you need the gospel. And according to my accounting, that's every one is the gospel is needed for those that were dignitaries and official of, of the court there the Ethiopian eunuch it was needed for him. The gospel was needed for those that were staunch Jews and high up in that just like Paul, the gospel was needed for synagogue leaders like Crispus, and the gospel was needed for what I might say common laborers, a merchant like, like Lydia, or a soldier, a guard, like the flippy, and jailer, the Gospels for all. And the book of Acts teaches us that that's an important message for us, we do not discriminate. The gospel is for all. Not only that, but everyone can respond to the gospel. Now, this follows necessarily from the previous point does it the gospel leads us to our response, the Gospels for all that means everyone can respond to the gospel. And that's important to know, there are some that teach that a person may want to be saved, but he cannot be saved, until God sins the Holy Spirit or has some kind of miraculous event within his heart. A man may want to be saved, but some people teach that he can't be saved. But when we look in the book of Acts, we don't see that we see those that want to be saved, can hear the gospel message, and believe it and respond. Everyone has that opportunity. You may be wealthy, you may be Bill Gates, and you may be able to write a check and buy anything you want in this world, the Gospels for you. You may not have a cent in a bank account, or even have a bank account. And the gospel is for you. It's not according to money, or wealth or fame. It is according to God's love for you. And he loves everyone. Everyone can respond to the gospel. We also see that sins are washed away at baptism. This is the response to the gospel message. This is after you hear and believe in your heart, you've made a commitment to change and you've repented, you've confessed Jesus as the Christ. Whether you do that then or that's part of the ongoing life you see there that baptism washes away sins. And that's a great thing. You can point back to a specific point in time and say, I know that my sins were washed away. I'm a child of God. If it were a time when there was something emotional tug at the heart, you may think was I say I can't remember I don't know, I felt something in my heart a little bit that day, but not all the way. Maybe it was the following week. And there could be some confusion in your mind, am I a Christian, a minor child with God. But with baptism, you can point to a specific time and know have confidence. I'm a child of God. It washes away sins, and we can be a clean child of God not because of what we've done, but because what God has done in us. We also see that conversion results in a changed life. Conversion changes you from being a child of the devil to being a child of God, you change your mind. You're not concerned with yourself primarily and the things of this world you put God first, not only changes your mind, but it changes your actions. You may live in sin and freely continuing those things in the world. But when you become a Christian, you say I need to do what is right. Paul is an example of that, isn't he? We already talked about that. He put away his sin, and he, as a child of God can continue to live after his will.

Jeremy Sweets  44:56
So we can learn a lot from the conversions and I And what I want to tell you is you have an opportunity to do exactly what they did in the first century really, things haven't changed. We serve the same God, don't we? We announced the same gospel, don't we? Then do the same things that they did. Hear the gospel message, believe that Jesus is the Christ, confess Him as Lord, repent of your sins and change the direction of your life, to be oriented toward God, and be baptized for the remission of your sins. Once you do that you started. That's a commitment of your entire life to follow God. And so that's where the challenge begins, in some ways is when we live our lives devoted to him. If you're here this morning and not a Christian, you have an opportunity to obey the gospel message. If you're here this morning and you are a Christian and you're not honoring your commitment. You have an opportunity to change your life change your ways back to what it should be. There's any that are subject to the gospel message. Please come as we stand and sing at this time.
