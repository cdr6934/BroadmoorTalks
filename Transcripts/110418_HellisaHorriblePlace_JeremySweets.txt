Good evening. It is good to see everyone here tonight, I appreciate the fact that you're here. It's a little bit rainy outside. But it's good to be here and to worship God. I do plan on speaking on the subject of hell tonight. And I want to tell you that hell is a horrible place. Now, my guess is you probably need more reminding of that fact, rather than convincing. So we're going to look at what the Bible has to say about this. This topic. I think it's a needed topic. We were driving here tonight, and I asked my wife, if I've had a downer day, as far as sermons, talking about the rugged cross and the pain and disgrace and then talking about hell tonight. That that may be the case, but I only do that because they're needed, I feel like they're needed. And that's hopefully not the only type of sermon that I preach. But we're going to look at Hell tonight. And the fact that hell is a horrible place. The Bible appropriately ends with the end. And that is the final judgments. It tells us about the time when God will make all things right, in which Heaven will, the New Jerusalem, heavens in the earth will come down and Heaven will exist, so that all things are made, right. And God will wipe away the tears that are upon the eyes of those that have suffered, there'll be no more pain or tears there for the righteous. But part of making all things right means bringing judgment upon those that have rejected him. And that's what we see in the final judgment as well. Not only is there a picture of heaven, the city for square, but there is also a picture of hell in Revelation 20, and verses 14 and 15. After the final judgement, the books have been opened before the throne, it says Death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire. This is the second death, the lake of fire. And if anyone's name was not found written in the Book of Life key was thrown into the lake of fire, the great day of God, all at the same time be a time of relief for those that have been persecuted and those that have relied upon God. And it will also be a horrible day for those that have rejected God. So I want to tell you about this horrible place hell, and it's my goal and aim that I would tell you something so that you can avoid it. That's all of our goal, that we would avoid this horrible place. Also say as I start that there's a lot of imagery used to describe both heaven and hell. In Part, I believe that the whole those concepts extend really beyond our minds. And so images give us a sense of reality. And I think there is Revelation covers a true picture, a real picture. But not necessarily always literal. But that doesn't mean again, that it's not real, and it doesn't exist, the picture of Hell is one that we certainly want to avoid whether every detail is literal or not. But it is real. And it describes that, that that place that we most certainly want to avoid. And so I think it's important to say that, also say that, that often the Bible doesn't have a

Jeremy Sweets  03:45
doesn't have a discourse, like you might look up a topical Bible, and it tells you here's the doctrine of hell. I've become much more comfortable in my preaching of taking a text and mining through that. Although sometimes I will talk about a subject as I'm doing tonight. But I want to warn you as I felt even a little uneasy and uncomfortable of grabbing so many scriptures, I just want you to know when I do that, we all need to be careful as you're listening, you need to listen for the context of what I'm saying. And so I've tried to even though I might not explain every single context, I've tried to take that into account. But I will say that it's easier to miss those things when you're pulling so many scriptures. Hell is a subject that is used very often in many teachings. And so I've pulled those, I want you to be aware that you'd be my friend if you help me. If I were to say something inaccurate or something against the context, I want you to bring that to my attention. You would be my friend if you did that. Okay, hell is a horrible place is a place for the wicked. The Bible talks about two destinations, two destinations and Matthew chapter seven it talks about those that would enter by the narrow gate. And it shows a contrast with those that go by the wide gate, Enter by the narrow gate, it says For the gate is wide, and the way is easy that leads to destruction. And many are those who enter by it, for the gate is narrow in the way is hard that leads to life. And, and those who find it are few, Matthew 713 and 14, there are two patterns, there are two destinations, we will either side with God and rely upon Him and trust upon him and enter upon the narrow way the difficult way. Or we will go along with the masses along the broad way. You know, may give you some statistics real quick I thought maybe helped highlight this. When we're talking about hell, there are many people that deny its existence that do not believe in it. This is 2000 in 2000, which is about 20 years ago now, but 64% of Americans believed in hell. I don't know if those statistics have changed or not. A Harris poll in 98 said that 80% of self proclaimed Christians believe in it, that would also mean that 20% deny it. And also 40% of non Christians believe in hell. But this is the statistic that I thought was interesting. Only 2% believe they are going there.

Jeremy Sweets  06:29
When we talk about the the way nobody wants to think that that's where they're headed. But often we can simply ignore the problem of sin and deny it's it's sickness that has taken place in our own life. And so I found it interesting as we talk about the Broadway in the narrow way the Broadway leads to destruction. But according to this poll, only 2% think they're alone that Broadway. That is not a statement where we need to cast look at them and how bad they are, that should make us pause shouldn't and ask ourselves, are we upon the narrow way? Yes, Hell is a place for the wicked and it is one of those two destinations. We also see scenes of final judgment in the Bible. For example, in Matthew chapter 25, there at depicts God on His throne separating the sheep from the goats in Matthew 25 and verse 31. Notice what it says, When the Son of Man comes in his glory and all the angels with him, then he will sit on his glorious throne before him will be gathered all the nations and He will separate people from one another as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats. And he will place the sheep on his right. But the goats on the left, he goes on to provide a description of those that are sheep and those that are goats. The sheep are those that extended kindness and warmth met the needs of their brothers, those that are goats that are sent to the left, or those that ignored those needs that did not consider their brother did not extend kindness in Matthew 25 and verse 41, as he talks about those that are goats, it says, Then he will say to those on his left, Depart from me, you cursed into the eternal fire prepared for the devil and his angels. Yes, Hell is a place prepared for the wicked, first of all for the devil and his angels, but then as we see those that follow after Him. In Revelation, chapter 20, I began talking about that final judgment seen in Revelation 20 And verse 11. There it says, Then I saw a great white throne and Him who was seated on it from his presence, earth and sky floodway, and no place was found for them. And I saw the dead great and small standing before the throne and books were opened. Then another book was opened, which is the book of life, and the dead were judged by what was written in the books according to what they had done. We see just a verse later. So it says an if anyone's name was not found written in the book of life, he was thrown into the lake of fire. In Revelation 21 Eight is it again further describes those that are on God ungodly. But as for the cowardly, the faithless, the detestable. As for murderers, and all liars, their portion will be in the lake that burns with fire and sulfur or brimstone, which is the second death. Notice the scene that we have here we have a throne scene in both Matthew 25 and also Revelation Chapter 20. God is the one that sits upon the throne. God is the one that will judge but he doesn't do that arbitrarily. Instead, he judges based upon the standard of what is written in the books and also based upon what people have done, how they have lived their life. And so we see that some based upon how they have lived their life will go to the right to heaven, and some will go to the left and to judgment. Hell is a place for the wicked. And it's a place

Unknown Speaker  10:21
where we don't want to go, where we don't want to be. I think about

Jeremy Sweets  10:25
a jail system, where people are put into, and in many ways, wickedness reigns. Now I'm thankful in this life, even in jails are those that reform, there are those that turn away from their past, there may even be at times those that have been wrongly convicted. So this is not a wholesale condemnation of everyone in the jail. But what a horrible place to be surrounded by only those that do wicked, to be completely absent of those that want to do what is right. Hell is a place for the wicked. Not only that, but as a place of torment, a place of torment. And Luke chapter 16, in verse 23, it talks about the rich man and Lazarus, the rich man lived sumptuously in this life, and he had little regard for Lazarus. But after the judgment came, or after he, they had both died, we see that Lazarus went to be in Abraham's bosom, and the rich man went to be in torment. In fact, this text says in verse 23, that he looked up being in torment, and later state, he later stayed in the next verse in verse 24. I am in anguish in this flame. Hell is a place of torment. In Revelation 20 And verse 10, says, The Devil and the beast and the false prophet were thrown into the lake of fire, and they will be tormented day and night forever and ever. They will be tormented day and night forever and ever. There is no end, and what exists there is torment. The Bible uses many descriptions to talk about hell, it says in Matthew are in Mark chapter nine, verses 43 through 48. There it talks about the urn, quench double fire, the unquenchable fire, in Revelation 2010, which we read earlier, it talks about the lake of fire and brimstone. In Matthew eight and verse 12, it talks about an outer darkness, and there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. I remember this was several years ago when I was talking to someone about this subject. And they said to me, Well, I'm sure some people will be having fun in hell. I don't, I don't really think she understood what hell is. That's not the picture, I see inscription. She was saying, it's not that bad. It can't be that bad. But that's not the picture in Scripture. Rather, we see one of torment.

Jeremy Sweets  13:20
We can also see this idea from where the very term was derived. The Greek word for hell is henna, and it derives its name from the Valley of Hinnom. We've encountered that place and our studies in Jeremiah and elsewhere. But we see in Second Chronicles chapter 28, and also chapter 33, that both Ahaz and Manasa, who were very wicked kings were guilty of making their sons pass through the fire. And that would have happened in this valley. As it describes the sacrifice that took place of sacrificing your sons on the fire, we see that it was very wicked and horrible thing in which those that were innocent were burned along. The Bible encyclopedia International Standard Bible encyclopedia says this, about these sacrifices. The image of Molek was a human figure with a bull's head and outstretched arms ready to receive the children destined for sacrifice. The image of metal was heated red hot by a fire kindled within, and the children laid on its arms rolled off into the fiery pit below. In order to drown the cries of the victims. Flutes were played and drums were beaten, and mothers stood by without tears or Psalms to give the impression of the voluntary cat character of the offering. What a horrible thing. They made their sons pass through the fire. In Jeremiah, the valley was renamed valley of slaughter, and it was associated with judgment. Later the valley became the city refuse dump. Another Bible Dictionary says apparently the Valley of Hinnom was used as the garbage dump for the city of Jerusalem. Refuse waste materials and DNA dead animals were burned deer fires continually smoldered and smoke from the burning debris rose day and night. Hinnom thus became a graphic symbol of whoa and judgment and of the place of eternal punishment called Hill. That was not a place I want to go. It's not a place where some people will be having some fun, but rather it is a place of torment. Hell is also a place without hope, without hope. And Dante's Inferno is the entrance of hell. As people go into the entrance of hell. There's a sign that reads there Abandon all hope all ye who enter here. And I think that's an accurate picture description of what hell will be like. There is no hope. Hell is described as eternal punishment in Matthew 25 and verse 46. It is a place where it says, The worm does not die and the fire is not quenched. Mark nine and verse 48. In Revelation 14 And verse 11, it says in the smoke of their torment goes up forever and ever, and they have no rest day or night. And it repeats that same language in Revelation chapter 20, and verse 10.

Jeremy Sweets  16:42
It is an eternal destruction and eternal punishment. It is a place without hope. There is no escape, and there is no relief. The rich man requested that Lazarus would show him mercy. Even though he did not show Lazarus any mercy. He requested Lazarus to dip the end of his finger in water and cool my tongue he asked, but it was refused. Father Abraham stated between us and you a great chasm has been fixed, in order that those who have passed from here to you may not be able and none may cross from there to us. Here we see that there is no hope of crossing. There is no way out. There is no hope for something better. There is eternal destruction and eternal death. Imagine how hopeless that is. Even if hell lasted a million years, after one year, you could say only 990 1999 to go. And one more year only this many to go. But there is no hope. There is no end. There is no way out. It is a hopeless place. And it's something that you most certainly want to avoid. Hell is a place without hope. It's a horrible place. It is also a place without God. Hell is a place where God is absent. In Second Thessalonians one in verse nine, it says they will suffer suffer the punishment of eternal destruction, away from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of his mind. eternal destruction is away from God. It is a place of night and darkness. And that makes sense doesn't it is a place of death. And that makes sense, doesn't it? Because God is the opposite of all those things. God is light. God is life. God is goodness. And if he is absent, then those things are not there. And so it is with hell. It is a place of darkness. It is a place of evil. It is a place where God is not. Some people talk about life, being here on Earth. But even when things are very bad, very things are very horrible. When sin sin seems to rain in such a grand way. We still see God at work in this life. It's really not possible for us as we sit here to really comprehend what it would be like without God. Even in the midst of our difficult times, or even if someone were to suffer unspeakable horrors and pain and suffering in this life, it is hard to imagine a place completely with out God. Hell is a place where God will not be It is described in Revelation as the second death. In Revelation, eternal punishment is described as the second death and Revelation 20 And verse 14 Again, Then death and Hades were thrown into the lake of fire. This is the second death, the lake of fire. You know, the first death is when our spirit leaves our body. The casket holds a dead and lifeless body, and animated. But why the body does not move, there is no life in it. The second death is when a person is separated from God. When the resurrected body is separated from God, God is the source of life. God is what gives all people life and goodness, but in hell, there will be no God, and you will be separated from him. And great will be that second death. Hell is a horrible place because God is not there. We also see that Hell is a place that can be avoided. Now, maybe talking about hell's a downer, but there's a reason we do it.

Jeremy Sweets  21:17
It's because we can avoid it. And that's great news. That should bring a smile to your face. It is a horrible place, but you don't have to go there. In fact, God doesn't want you to go there. God doesn't want anybody to go there. His desire is that you would avoid it, and he's made preparations and plans so that you can avoid it. And that's great news. That is great news. It is a place that can be avoided. First of all, we see that if we are to avoid hell, we need to fear God, Fear God and Matthew 10 and verse 28, says, Do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. rather fear him who can destroy both soul and body and hell. We so too often fear other people and situations and being looked down upon we fear what other people can do to social situations and, and many different consequences from other people. Bible says, that's really nothing to fear. You want to fear something, Fear God Almighty, who has the ability and the power to throw you into hell, if you would reject Him, fear him who can destroy both soul and body in hell? How can be avoided if we would listen to the scripture, and Luke 16, Luke 16. There we see the story of the rich man and Lazarus, he recognized that how could be avoided, in fact, he said, Please, send Lazarus to my brothers, so that he can tell them so that they might avoid this place. He knew that hell could be avoided. And remember what Abraham said to lad to the rich man. He said, They have Moses and the prophets, let them hear them. I think that would apply to us today as well. We have the scriptures. Let us listen to it. Let us hear so that we can avoid that horrible place. We don't have to go there. Let us listen to the scriptures in order to avoid it. Let us also repent. And second Peter chapter three and verse nine. It says The Lord is not slow about his promises, some count slowness, but is patient toward you not wishing that any would perish, but that all should come to repentance. God doesn't want anyone to die.

Jeremy Sweets  23:48
In Hell, God doesn't want anyone to suffer that fate. He wants you to repent. He wants you to turn away from your sins. In fact, God has allowed the mockers to continue on, he has not come and brought judgment yet, because he's waiting for you. He's waiting for those that have not turned to him. He's allowing time to take place, even though some use that as an excuse to say that God is not powerful, God is weak, God will not do what he says. God will. But the reason he hasn't yet is because he is waiting for sinners to repent. He's not slow. He's loving, and he's kind and so let us repent. Let us do what God wants us to do so that we can be with him. Let us also put away sin This is a passage we read in our Bible reading tonight. And Hebrews 1026 And 27 says For if we go on sinning deliberately after receiving the knowledge of the truth, there no longer remains a sacrifice Vice for sins, but a fearful expectation of judgment and a fury of fire that will consume the adversary. If we would come to God, and then continue in sin, there's no more sacrifice, we've rejected the one sacrifice of Christ, there's no other way. There's not a second covering, there's not a second way that will then cover us again. And so we will have a confident an expectation of judgment. And the text says that it is a fury of fire that will consume the adversaries. Help can be avoided. But let us put away sin in order to avoid it. Let us also obey the gospel. And second Thessalonians, one in verse eight, says that Jesus will be revealed and he'll provide relief to the afflicted. But also it says that he will be inflicting vengeance on those who do not know God, and on those who do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus. If you want to avoid the horrible place called hell, then please obey the gospel. Listen to the good news that Jesus is the Christ that God sent His only Son to die for you and for me, listen to that message and obey it. It calls for you to do something. It's not just news, like you might turn on the news tonight. And it's just information. But it is a message that calls us to act calls us to respond. And so respond, obey the gospel, heed the glad tidings do what God says. Not only that, but we also need to cut away and cut out all hindrances. Anything that would cause us to stumble, anything that would get in our way of our service to God needs to be removed. And Mark nine in verse 43, it says, And if your hand causes you to sin, cut it off, it is better for you to enter live crippled than with two hands to go to hell, to the urn, quench double fire, it says the same thing about the leg, cut it off, it's better to go. It's better to be laying than to go to hell with your legs. And the same thing with your I cut it out. Anything that would stand in your way of service to God needs to be removed. And not just maybe I'll get to that. Maybe I'll remove that stumbling block someday. But there needs to be a real sense of urgency. This is keeping me from my most important appointment, the time when we can be with God. This is keeping me away from heaven. And this will lead me to a horrible, horrible place. In Matthew chapter 16, Jesus asked the question, What will you give in exchange for your soul? That's the question I asked you tonight. If you had all the riches in the world, would that be a fair trade? Would that be enough to give in exchange for your soul? Some people spend their whole lives wishing for wanting desiring wealth.

Jeremy Sweets  28:33
But that does not equal is not worth our soul. So where should we be spending our attention? devoting our whole life to making money or devoting our whole life to making sure that we can be with God and Heaven one day? I think the answer is obvious. And Hebrews 10 And verse 31. It says, It is a fearful thing, to fall into the hands of a living God. It is a fearful thing. God will do what he says he's going to do and we need to trust His word on that. So let us avoid it. Let us accept the gospel and obey God and all things. There's anyone here tonight that is not a Christian, obey the gospel message believing that Jesus is the Christ repenting of your sins, confessing that Jesus is the Christ and being baptized in the water for the forgiveness of your sins. If you're here tonight and you are a Christian, it may be that you've turned away from that sacrifice. There is no longer a sacrifice that will cover your sins. You need to repent and go back to God. There's anyone subject to the invitation please come as we stand and sing at this time.
