Good morning. It's good to see everyone here today. It's good to be here. It's always good to be able to worship God. We have talked about worship in our classes the last several weeks. And that's what we're seeking to do here direct our worship and praise and adoration to God, to do it sincerely and with our hearts. Not in a hypocritical way, but to honestly worship God. And so I'm glad that you're here with me this morning to do that. I also will say that I appreciate Nick for his prayer and Nick, for a song leading. And I also appreciate evidence he directed our thoughts on the Lord's Supper, I think they all helped us focus our minds. We live some 2000 years since the time of Jesus, I think that presents some challenges for us. As we look to scriptures, one of those challenges is that we didn't live in the first century. So we don't always have their thought world, we don't always have their culture in mind. We live in a different culture. Now God intended for the scriptures to apply for all future cultures. So that's not an impossible task. That's not something that is impossible for us, but it's just something to be aware of. And I see that there is no greater distinction maybe in our culture than when it comes to the crops. So I'd like to talk for just a few moments this morning about that cross. Today, the cross is adored. It's found in churches. It's displayed in the front and in the midst of churches, its logos for businesses. It's often worn as jewelry, diamond studded charms, and people say, Oh, what a nice cross. What a beautiful cross. That is. Now I'm not saying there's anything wrong with wearing a cross. But what I am saying is that our culture seems to have sanitized the crawl. I think our culture has lost really that original intent, that meaning, we see the cross is something beautiful, and not as an old, Rugged Cross. This morning, I'd like to talk about the scandal of the cross. It's not so scandalous today, at least in passing. But in the first century, the cross was a scandal. It was surprising. A scandal according to dictionary.com is simply a disgraceful or discreditable action or circumstance, an offense caused by a fault or misdeed damage to reputation, public disgrace, a person whose conduct brings disgrace or offence and you see several words repeated there disgrace being one of them. The cross was disgraceful in the first century. And so we may wear a cross, but would we wear an electric chair? No, that would be morbid. That that would be unusual and quite odd, would we wear a noose or a gear to where we display that in our home? Now that would be quite strange, and quite often, and I really shouldn't have equals there, but rather a pointing forward. Maybe those are some associations that we need to see is that's how they saw the cross in the first century. That's how they saw the cross. I was reminded that there's a new story, I think, just this past Thursday, a person was electrocuted in the electric chair and in Tennessee. And as I read that, I was impressed with how bad that seems. And they talked about the difference between the electric chair and lethal injection and this gentleman actually chose the electric chair. But that that seems odd to us barbaric. We cringe at the thought of that. Well, we need to see that in the first century. The cross was a disgrace. The cross was scandalous. And I'd like to look at first Corinthians chapter one, verses 18 through 31, as we can consider this subject. Let's start with reading that passage and I'll read half of that passage through verse 25.

For the word of the cross is folly to those who are perishing, but those who are being saved, that is the power of God. For it is written, I will destroy the wisdom of the wise and the discernment of the discerning I will for where's the one who is wise? Where is the scribe, whereas the debater of this age Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world. For sensing the wisdom of God, the world did not know God through wisdom, it pleased God through the folly of what we preach to save those who believe. For Jews demand signs, and Greeks seek wisdom. But we preach Christ crucified, a stumbling block to Jews and folly to Gentiles, but to those who are called both Jews and Greeks, Christ, the power of God, and the wisdom of God, for the foolishness of God is wiser than men, and the weakness of God is stronger than men. I want to start off by looking at really the two ways that the crosses view. And the first one of those ways is found in verse 18. Or really both are found in verse 18. And that is foolishness. The cross is seen as foolishness to those who are perishing or falling. So how was the cross feud in the first century? Why was it folly or foolishness? Well, it was unthinkable that the Savior would come through a crucifixion, the Savior would be put to death, particularly in that manner. And in that way. In our country, the death penalty is occasionally carried out, like I said, in Tennessee, it just recently happened this past week. But that does not happen before the appropriate judicial process takes place. And so we have a concept of due process, allowing a process to occur. So we don't make a rush to judgment. We allow a trial by jury where peers sit upon a case and listen to the evidence and make a decision. And it's only when all are agreed upon that jury of that they would convict a person. If a person is convicted of a serious enough crime, the death penalty may be the sentence. But before the sentence is even carried out, there are delays. There are there is time for appeals, there is an effort in our country to make sure that it is just and then is occurring according to the laws according to what is right. Often within these peels, there's a search for new evidence, maybe there is something that we missed. And so you can see how this process took a long time. And if we get to that point where the death penalty is carried out, it is carried out in private. With just a few witnesses. There is an effort for the death penalty to be carried out quickly and humanely. There's not an effort to prolong suffering, but it's something that should happen quickly. Limiting the amount of time and suffering. What I just described to you is the very opposite of the Roman view of the death penalty. The Romans did not operate in this fashion. In fact, in many ways, they were the opposite view, there was no procedure for due process. A trial by jury was not had there was no right to appeal, they dealt with punishment swiftly, publicly, and in an effort to maximize the amount of pain and suffering that was to occur. crucifixion was invented by the Persians, but they say that it was perfected by the Romans, who wanted to inflict as much pain and suffering as possible. And it was public for a reason. This is what will happen if you crossed the Roman Empire, and so it was on display. Not only was it painful, but it was disgraceful, inflicted public humiliation in a prolonged fashion. And this humiliation did not end in death. In fact, often the corpse was allowed to stay upon the cross and were not given a proper burial, but rather the birds and the dogs would eat it and pick away from the dead body. This was not a respectable situation, or a respectable person that was to die in this way.

Jeremy Sweets  09:46
Roman citizens in fact, were exempt from this type of penalty. Cicero states let the very name of the cross be far away not only from the body of a Roman citizen but Even from his thoughts, his eyes and his ears. And so often this was carried out on on slaves, or upon what they would call barbarians, non Romans, those that were not civilized, not within the culture of the Roman Empire. And so it was reserved for those that were outside of the normal society, slaves, the dregs they would say, of society. And it was a warning for all of those that would see that this is what happens. It was a disgrace. It was a disgrace. Well, the Jewish view was not far different. We see in verse 23, the Romans see it as falling. But it is a stumbling block to the Jews. The Jews did not like the cross any better. The Jews expectation from the Messiah would be that he was that he would be a mighty warrior like David, that he would establish a nation that he would take the land, that he would subdue his enemies, and that he would lead a great arming in the defeat of those that are around him. But Jesus didn't measure up to this expectation. And he was seen as a stumbling block. Not only that, but they saw hanging upon a tree and by relation also crucifixion, as a curse. Deuteronomy 21 Verse 23, says, curses everyone who hangs on a tree, in this passage was quoted in Galatians chapter three. But Jesus was crucified. He hung on a tree, and he was seen as a stumbling block to the Jew. Notice that Paul further expands upon the means in which God uses in verse 27, and 28. Allow me to read 26 through the end of this chapter, to pick up the rest of our verse here. For consider your calling brothers, not many of you are wise according to worldly standards. Not many were powerful. Not many were of noble birth. But God chose what is foolish in the world to shame the ones. God chose what is weak in the world to shame the strong. God chose what is low and despised in the world, even things that are not to bring to nothing things that are so that no human being might boast in the presence of God. And because of him, you're in Christ Jesus, who became does wisdom from God, righteousness and sanctification and redemption. So that as it is written, let the one who boasts boast in the Lord, you know, the world does not accept the means that God uses to bring about his plan. It's viewed as backward. It's viewed as something that's unusual and strange. God uses the foolish things. It says in verse 2728, the weak things, and the despised things, consider wisdom and falling. wisdom tells us that the victor puts his enemies to death. And it is the loser who is captured and executed. Just like the electric chair today, wisdom told the Roman world that the cross was reserved for the ruthless criminal and the barbarian. Wisdom as defined by the world tells us that Jesus could not possibly be the Messiah, because it is foolish to think that the cross could produce the Savior of the world. That's losing, not saving. But God chose what is foolish in the world to shame the why that was God's mean. What about weakness and strength, strength is found today and and at that time as well and wealth, and then the wealthy businessman, the One who engages in commerce and cares about the bottom line strength is found in political rulers who wield the power to determine the direction of a nation. Strength is found in military leaders who direct armies to overtake the opposing forces. Strength is found in the warrior who can physically subdue his enemy. Strength as defined by the world was nowhere to be found in Jesus. He was none of these things. Pilate tried to remind Jesus at his trial, do you not know that I

Jeremy Sweets  14:45
have power over you, to release you or power to put you to death? Don't you understand? This? pilot says I have power over you. The soldiers Furthermore, mocked Gee uses for being an alleged king. And so they put a purple robe on his bloody back that had been bloodied from being whipped. They pressed the crown of thorns upon his head. And I'm sure they were not gentle. I'm sure they were not easy. At the cross a soldier further talking to Jesus for His weakness, saying, if you are the king of the Jews, and I can hear the scarf in his voice, if you are the king of the Jews, then save yourself because after all, a king would certainly command an army. And a king would certainly mount to resistance. So where are those things King Jesus, Jesus offered no resistance. And he was executed on the cross. Jesus was weak in the eyes of the world, but God chose what is weak in the world to shame the strong. Consider also that which is despised that which is despise, the world exalts, the rich, the Edit, educated, the powerful and the ruthless. But Jesus was born in a barn alongside animals. But Jesus was a homeless man with few if any possessions to his name, but Jesus associated with the dregs of society, with tax collectors, with harlots with centers. The world despise the cross. But Hebrews 12, in verse two tells us that Jesus endured the cross, despising the shame, enduring the shame. Yes, the world exalts in many things. And Jesus was none of those. But God shows what is low and despised in the world, even things that are not to bring to nothing things that are, you see that God was working in a way that was unknown to the world that was out of hand rejected by many, this could not possibly be God's ways, because it doesn't make sense to me. Because it's not what seems right. It's not according to what I know. Yes, the cross was foolishness to Romans. The cross was foolishness to Jews. And in many ways, the cross is foolishness today, according to the world. Well notice, not only was it foolishness in First Corinthians one in verse 18, but it was also power was also a power. First Corinthians 118 says, For the word of the cross is folly to those who are perishing. but to us who are being saved, it is the power of God. The power of the cross is not determined by its esteem among the world, or by whether it adheres to conventional wisdom, but rather the power of the cross was, was determined by what it could accomplish by what it did. By dying on the cross, Jesus took away from us the penalty that we deserved. So notice our wages, The wages of sin is death, that first word there should be death, same as what we do death as a result, Romans chapter six and verse 23. With that sin we bring upon ourselves a curse, a reproach and in the end, true poverty. But when we look at scriptures, we see that Jesus took those things away. In fact, he endured those things. We see in Isaiah chapter 53, and verse six, All we like sheep have gone astray we have turned every one to his own way, and the Lord has laid on him the iniquity of us all. Jesus bore the penalty of death that we deserve. We also see in Galatians, chapter three and verse 13, is it quotes that passage from Deuteronomy, saying that the hanging on a tree is cursed. Notice what Galatians 313 says, Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us. For his written curses, everyone who was hanged on a tree, Christ redeemed us, he struck out the curse for us.

Jeremy Sweets  19:40
We see also that he took away our reproach and Romans chapter 15, and verse three. There it says, For Christ did not please himself, but as it is written, the reproaches of those who were approached you fell on me. Jesus was not concerned for himself, but he gave himself for us. He took the approach on himself suffering on the cross for and he took our approach away. In second Corinthians chapter eight and verse nine. There it says, For you know the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ that though he was rich, yet for your sakes he became poor, so that you by his poverty might become rich. Jesus took the penalty of the crawl, and he suffered on the cross for us. There's a few passages that talk about this suffering. I mentioned Hebrews chapter 12. And verse two. We also see it in Philippians, in Philippians, chapter two, where it says that Jesus humbled himself to the point of being obedient to the point of death, it uses language, even death on a cross. And you can feel Paul's cringe at that statement. Even death on a cross, that's the extent the cross is an old, Rugged Cross, of pain, of suffering, of reproach of disgrace. But we need to see what Jesus endured in order to save us. And that's the true power of the cross. In first Corinthians chapter one and verse 30, it summarizes many of those things it says, and because of him, and because of him, you are in Christ Jesus, who became to us wisdom from God, righteousness and sanctification and redemption. sanctification and redemption should be indented one more, I think my font messed up. Notice a few things about this passage, it is because of him, it is because of what he did. It is because of the cross, that we have any hope whatsoever. It also says it is because of him that you're in Christ Jesus. When we are outside of Christ, when we are living in sin, when we are away from God separated from God, we see that we bear all that pain and, and penalty of sin, death, curse, reproach, we bear that on our own, and we have no way to deal with that. But it is when we are in Christ Jesus, that we can have our sins washed away, wiped away, the curse taken away, the Rippert reproach taken away, it's when we can become rich in him instead of living in poverty. Jesus Christ became the wisdom of God, it looked like foolishness to the world. But he became the wisdom of God, the very execution of God's plan. And when he became the wisdom of God, we see in Christ there is righteousness, sanctification, being set apart from sin, and redemption to be bought back from the clutches of Satan. We see that it is in Christ, that we can have our sins washed away. First Corinthians one and verse 30. It's a great passage. What seems like Folly is really the wisdom of God. It's really how God sought to accomplish His will. me add one other point to this, and that is that Jesus was exalted on the cross, it was God's means for accomplishing His plan. In the eyes of the world, he was humble. But in the eyes of God, according to his very plan, he was lifted a fact John uses that phrase lifted up and it seems to almost be a play on words, Jesus was hoisted up on a cross, but he was also lifted up. In John three and verse 14, it says, And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up that servant, that serpent, was a salvation for those that looked upon it, the son of man would also be a salvation for those in need. In John 12, verses 32 and 33. It says, and I, when I am lifted up from the earth will draw people to myself. He said this to show by what kind of death he was going to die, Jesus Christ would be lifted.

Jeremy Sweets  24:38
And also in Philippians, chapter two, the passage I mentioned earlier, read Jesus humbled Himself. Notice the flow of the passage, Jesus at the right hand of God, it says he humbled himself. And he did that by taking the likeness of men by taking the form of a servant by humbling self and becoming obedient to the death, even death on occasion. off, do you see how low Jesus humbled himself? But that passage does not end in a valley. But it says that God exalted him. God raised Him up. God showed that he was the very plan that he intended, the lowering and humiliation of the cross proceeded exultation. So there's two ways to look at the cross. It is folly to those who are perishing. But it is the power of God, to those who are being say, Well, that's the what, of what I want to say. So now for the so what, what does that mean for us, I believe that we are called to live in the power of the cross, we are called to live according to that power. If we are those that are being saved, relying upon God and punish strength, we must live within the power of the cross. So what are some lessons for us today that we can learn? Well, first of all, trust in God. God has some unconventional ways of accomplishing His will, in some ways that seem odd and strange. And it may be we look at that and say, I don't want to have anything to do with that. That's simply strange. That's unusual. That's odd. That won't work. After all, if I were going to choose a nation of people, here's how I would not start by choosing one old man and his barren why. That's exactly what God did. But not only that, that old man and his wife eventually had a son, and that son married a barren wife. And they had children and that son married a barren wife. That didn't seem right. To me, that seems odd. That's not going to work. But God raised the nation. From Abraham, and the patriarchs. In the Old Testament, we see that God didn't have the really the military tactics and techniques that we would expect. After all, wisdom tells us that if you're going to fight another army, you want to have as many people as possible, right? You want to have a big army, but God often chose the smaller army. Often they were out number two to one. God chose with Gideon 300. Men, he he took it down from 32,000 to 300. And you did that? And it seemed Aw, god seems strange, that will not work. That does not seem like it would work. God shows unconventional tactics, military tactics. When he took Jericho everyone knows you encircle the city, but you stay there, and you lay a siege against the city, and you strangle them, you don't simply walk around and then leave. That's no way to take city. No matter how many times you do it, that doesn't seem right. You see, God uses unconventional means and unconventional ways. But I think he does that for a reason. He does that for a purpose. And that is so that we would trust in Him. God's ways will work. And we need to believe it. And we need to trust it. And we need to trust Him. God is mighty to say, God is powerful, and he can accomplish great things. Not only that, but you need to crucify yourself. I didn't know whether to use I know whether use this language or take up your cross. This one made me cringe a little bit more. That's not the way I want to say that. Maybe that's why I said it that way. I'm not talking about a physical crucifixion where you physically go and do this. But consider the shame and the reproach that Jesus bore. Consider the pain and the death that he suffered. The Bible tells us that we are to do the same thing. Matthew 16 In verse 24, says, If anyone would come after Me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow Me. Paul said in Galatians, two in verse 20, I have been crucified with Christ.

Jeremy Sweets  29:25
It is no longer I who live but Christ who lives in me, the life I now live in the flesh, I live by faith and the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me. Sometimes we read over that passage, but that first part of that verse may be the most shocking statement in all the Scripture. I've been crucified with Christ. I've been crucified with Christ. When you consider the disgrace of the cross, you see the real impact and the real import of that statement? Yes, we need to Put to death, or will, we need to put to death, the fleshly desires that would seek after sin, the very thing that would destroy our relationship with God, we need to put to death, our selves. But when we do that, that's not the end. Sometimes we think about death as the end. But the Bible says that we put to death that man and we're raised to walk in newness of life, we're raised to walk in a new way, there's a new man, a man that is a servant of God, a follower of God. And so we must crucify ourselves. Not only that, but we must expect suffering, and reproach. Christians are going to be a backward people. Christians are going to be those that bear the reproach of the world, Christians are going to be those that are looked down upon. That's not always been true in our history. Sometimes we talk about a Christian nation, or we talk about the fact that we need to get back to our roots, we need to uphold Christian values. And I'm not saying we shouldn't try to put forth the values of Christ. But we need to know and understand that being a Christian is not where we take our seed in the place of honor. That's not what we equate equate with being Christian. And Hebrews chapter 13, and verses 12 and 13. It talks about the atonement of the Old Testament. And it tells us that Jesus is our atonement sacrifice. And if you remember in the Old Testament that that one of the Lambs was taken outside the gate away from the camp. And in that same way, Hebrews 13, verse 12, says, so Jesus also suffered outside the gate, in order to sanctify the people through his own blah, notice verse 13. Therefore let us go to him outside the camp and bear the reproach he and your, if you're going to be a disciple of Christ, a follower of Christ, you will follow him into reproach. You will follow him into suffering, you will follow him into disgrace. That's just the way it's going to work. But we must do that willingly. That seems foolish and odd to call people into that. But just as it seemed odd for Christ to endure those things, and afterwards, the great power of God is displayed. So it is for us. It may seem odd to call people in that manner in that way, but God calls us to suffering, reproach and disgrace, knowing that there are far greater things that lie ahead. We also see in Philippians, chapter three and verse 10, that Paul says, suffered the loss of all things that he might know Christ, that He might gain cries. And it says in verse 10, that I might know him and the power of resurrection, and may share his sufferings, becoming like him in his death. We will share the sufferings of Christ. The Bible talks about those, the seed that was sown, and there are many that initially accept the Word. But there are many that fall away. And this, in part is reason for that. The Bible says, count the costs. Yes, there's a great promise found in Christ. But that also comes at a cost that we must be willing to pay a following God no matter what, of suffering, of bearing reproach of being a disgrace. And so if you're willing to endure that, if you're willing to follow Christ into his sufferings, then you can have the great glory and promises that awaits you, that which is promised, but as a people, let us expect suffering and reproach

Jeremy Sweets  34:19
let us also boast in the Lord, not ourselves. That was in part I believe, the reason or maybe the whole reason that God chose unconventional means and unconventional ways. In fact, we see much of that point in First Corinthians chapter one. It says in verse 29, after it says that he chose the foolish, he chose the weak, he chose the despised. Verse 29 says, so that no human being might boast in the presence of God. This wasn't a way that seemed to work according to people and God says That's right. If your way was not work, and that for that reason, you have no reason to boast in yourself, but rather boast in the Lord. We often boast in ourselves, don't we, and our accomplishments and what we can do and how great we are and how many friends we have, and how many likes we have, and how many people we know how much money we have. We boast in a lot of things, but we've seen before God. So let us not boast in ourselves and what we can accomplish, but let us boast in the Lord and what he has done for us. The old rugged cross, I think, points us in that direction, boasting in God. And along with boasting, and God let us be thankful. When you stop, consider what Christ has done for us, you can't help but be thankful. You should be thankful in a way that your life is consumed with thanksgiving. It's just a part of who you are, when you've experienced this kind of salvation. When you see the Christ went to the cross for us. There's no other choice. There's no other way, but to be extremely thankful. The kind of thankfulness that that is lifelong, lifelong. You know, in some moody movies, if someone were to save the life of another, that person would become their servants for all of their days. Say, I'll serve you, I'll follow you around, I will help you in whatever way you can. I owe my life to you. owe my life to you. Jesus Christ died on the cross for us and we owe our lives to Him. We owe our all to him. So let us be thankful. We're going to be singing a song in just a moment. That is an invitation extended by really God Himself to you, He calls you to him. He wants you to be a Christian, he wants you to be a disciple of Christ. He wants you to be in relationship with Him. You can do that by turning away from your sin by repenting of your sin and turning to live a life according to God and then his way devoting yourself to be a servant, confessing that Jesus is the Christ, and also by being baptized in the water for the forgiveness of your sins. When you do that you put to death, the old man and you're raised to walk in newness of life. Is that not a beautiful picture? Is that not a beautiful offering? That God extends to you? If you're here this morning, and you are a Christian, and you're not living as you should remember, you made a lifelong commitment. And if you're not honoring that, that is a shame and you need to change your ways. There's any that are subject to the invitation, please come as we stand and sing at this time.
