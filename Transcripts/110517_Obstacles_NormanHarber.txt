I'd like to direct your attention to Exodus chapter 13, if you'd like to follow along, we remember in, in Exodus, as God has just delivered the Israelites from from the bondage of of Egypt, that he leads them out. In chapter 13 Verse 17, it says, When Pharaoh let the people go, God did not lead them by the way of the land of the Philistines, although that was near. In chapter 13, verse 18, says, But God led the people around by the way of the wilderness toward the Red Sea. And if you've dropped down to verse 21, and the Lord went before them by day and a pillar of cloud to lead them along the way, and by night and a pillar of fire, to give them like that they might travel by day and by night, the pillar of cloud by day and the pillar of fire by night did not depart from before the people. There Israelites were going on the path that God led them on. But he led them right to a dead end. And God knew it was there all along. The people saw the red sea before them, and then that the Egyptians pursuing from behind them, and they were terrified. And they cried out, look in chapter 14, verse 10, when Pharaoh drew near the people of Israel lifted up their eyes, and behold, the Egyptians were marching after them, and they feared greatly, and the people of Israel cried out to the Lord. And they said to Moses, is it because there are no graves in Egypt, that you have taken us away to die in the wilderness? What What have you done to us and bringing us out of Egypt? Is not this what we said to you in Egypt, leave us alone that we might serve the Egyptians, for would have been better for us to serve the Egyptians than to die in the wilderness. Look, their reaction? It's it's fear, it's panic. Is God destroying us? They blame Moses? Is God punishing us? Did he? Did he bring us out of Egypt just to see us die in the wilderness? This morning, I'd like to talk about the topic of obstacles. And I'd like to make four points this morning. What are they? Why do they happen? How should we react to them, and then using our obstacles. So let's first of all, just talk about what I mean. When I use the word obstacle this morning, how I'm going to use it in the lesson. Well, we've all come upon unexpected roadblocks. As we're as we're driving along, there may be a bridge out, there might be a rock in the road. That might be unexpected. But we've all faced obstacles in one way or another. I've heard of, of marathoners describe their race. And first of all, just think of all the unexpected things, somebody that's running 26 Miles has to go through the weather is going to change the wind might be against them, the terrain is going to be difficult. Just the the amount of people around them they have to jog through is unexpected. And then there's the mental aspect. That's almost as tough as the physical when running a marathon. But then they have what's called hitting the wall. It's a it's a real thing. About two thirds or three quarters of the way through a marathon, a lot of runners hit the wall, when their body just says, I'm not doing this anymore. I'm not made for this, and it begins to shut down. And they either have to work through it work through that wall, or they have to quit. If some people can't make it past the wall. Will obstacle obstacles come in different shapes and different sizes, and different levels of difficulty. Some are physical, and some are mental. Obstacles can take different forms. In our personal lives, it may take the form of a sickness, a death of a close friend or relative. Maybe it's a difficult person in your life. Maybe you've been abandoned. Maybe you're having financial difficulties, maybe a job related issue, maybe some kind of serious injury. And that list could go on and on. But it's a challenge and it's a test. God had led the Israelites to what seemed like an insurmountable obstacle at the Red Sea. They had no idea it was coming up.

Unknown Speaker  04:45
But let me explain the difference between what I call expected and unexpected obstacles. There are some walls that we build ourselves. Maybe it's because of addictions that we have. Maybe it's because of bad relationships that we've enabled, maybe bad habits that have led to bad situations in our life, creating walls, or letting wealth control us, having riches as your God or not necessarily having riches, but having a materialistic mindset, which might lead you into debt. And that controls your life. Those I would call expected obstacles because they're a natural result of a bad behavior. And it's not really my purpose this morning to talk about those kinds of obstacles. Those issues, of course, have to be dealt with. And Scripture does speak to them. But I want to focus more on what I'm calling the unexpected obstacle, you're continuing on your path. And what you might think is the right path, but then suddenly, you're blocked unexpectedly, going back is not an option. Consider briefly some of these examples from scriptures. And I'm going to run through these very quickly. And as I came up with examples from scripture, I just kept coming up with more and I just had to stop but just think about some of these examples. You remember balem he was riding along in his donkey and what happened? He saw an angel of the Lord in front of him, wasn't expecting that whatsoever. You remember naming, he didn't expect to be told to Clint be cleansed of his leprosy. He didn't expect to be told to go wash in the in the dirty old Jordan River. Jonah, his obstacle was his opinion of the Ninevites. That was something he couldn't get past. Think of Daniel and they made a law that banned Prain. That was unexpected. Daniel's three friends were were told to bow down in worship Nebuchadnezzar golden image, Joseph was unfairly put in a pit and then later prison. He wasn't expecting that. Esther's obstacle was her dilemma. She had to make a decision as a Jewish Queen concerning the fate of her people in a foreign land. The Israelites faced a human wall in Goliath. They faced a literal wall at Jericho. How in the world are you going to take a city like that Hezekiah had 185,000 of Syrian soldiers camped outside the walls of Jerusalem. Peter didn't expect to be challenged about being a close companion of Jesus. In the parable of the sower, the person with the heart, like rocky ground, doesn't expect persecution to come along. It presented a wall that he wasn't ready for. Joseph and Mary, young couple, they're confused about what had happened to her. What were they supposed to do? What were people going to think about her? The rich young ruler didn't know his wealth would ever be a problem in his life until he met Jesus. Job lost just about everything unexpectedly. How in the world could he possibly go on. And then the man of Psalm 73, that Trevor spoke to us about Wednesday night, he had a real problem with the wicked rich and his envy of them. He was at a point where he was so envious. He couldn't get past his his problem with them. So those are just a few examples in scripture. But whether expected or unexpected, these walls are real, these obstacles are real, and they must be dealt with. And most likely, most likely, all of us are either either have just left an obstacle. We're dealing with one now, or we're about to hit another one. There are frequent, and they affect us all. So just summarizing, briefly what I just said. Obstacles are life challenges. There are tests that come to each one of us. They're unexpected, and they're frequent. And they happen to us all.

Unknown Speaker  09:12
So why do they? Why do they happen? As I said, sometimes we we build them ourselves. Those are those expected walls. But sometimes others put them up for us. Sometimes they're avoidable. Other times they're not. So there can be people, there can be situations, there can be limitations in your life that are real challenges. And often they're there to test us. Your challenge can be in the form of a person. It might be your boss, it might be a co worker, it might be a friend. It might be a family member. But are you treating that situation as a challenge? Or are you just bitter about it? I think it's clearly seen from scripture that God does place challenges Walls and obstacles in our path. And the most famous example is probably job. God, only God allowed Satan to take everything from him, but but for what purpose, job agonized and he analyzed, he argued, and he questioned God. In the end, job learned that God is God, and man is man, and he was humbled, and God blessed him in the end. But I would also suggest that job learned about joy, because joy can be found in obstacles, because the end result of obstacles and testing is patience and character, and hope, which we'll read about in Romans chapter five a little bit later. Well, let's go back to that Red Sea example for just a moment. God, God blocked the Israelites at the Red Sea, not only for the Israelites, but for the Egyptians. So they would know that He was God and verse four, chapter 14, it says, And I will hardened Pharaoh's heart, and He will pursue them and I will get glory over Pharaoh, and all his hosts in the Egyptians shall know that I am the Lord. And they did. So. Sometimes God allows situations so that His glory might be evident to all, you remember the story in John nine, the man born blind, remember how that was described? It was described so that he was described that so that the works of God would be evident or be displayed in him so that God would be glorified. In that situation. God sometimes allowed those situations to exist. And sometimes the time of testing is to see how people will react, will they be selfish? Or will they be defiant? That's what God was looking for in the Israelites? Or will would they give him glory? Well, we'll see later how God's told Paul, his thorn in the flesh was left in place to keep him from being too arrogant. So God puts up obstacles to humble us as well. You will remember that when the Israelites saw the Red Sea on one side, and the Egyptians on the other, they responded with fear and blame, but here is Moses response to them. He said, Fear not stand firm, and see the salvation of the Lord, which he will work for you today. For the Egyptians, whom you see today, you shall never see again, the Lord will fight for you, and you have only to be silent. Look at the phrases that that Moses uses here. When he responds to the Israelites. He says, first of all, don't be afraid. Don't fear. Well, how can he tell them that considering their situation? What did they just think? They had seen God working miracles in the 10 plagues by delivering them from Egypt. He they had seen his power, they knew God was their God. He says to stand firm or be still, he says, Stop, don't don't panic. Don't despair. Despair causes you to lose hope. Fear makes you retreat. Impatience makes you makes you act without thinking it through. Presumption doesn't wait for all the facts. So those aren't the ways to respond. Sometimes we just need to stop and think. He says, Be silent. Don't react too soon. And don't speak without thinking, as James tells us in chapter one, verse 19, what would they see they would see the salvation of the Lord. Look for God's lessons, look for his deliverance. Moses probably didn't know at this time exactly how God was going to do it. But he knew God would do it.

Unknown Speaker  14:01
He knew Israel would be saved. He said, God will fight for you. He's on your side, he wants your best. There's a timeless testing for them. And Moses was, was trying to explain that to them. It's also interesting that when the people came into the land, later on, that God didn't remove all the existing people from the land. And he gave them a reason for that. He left them there to test them. In Judges chapter three, we read about this, and not reading all this passage. But it does say that these are the nations that the Lord left to test Israel by them some of the Canaanites he left in the land. And down in verse four, it says they were for the testing of Israel to know whether Israel would obey the commandments of the Lord. He didn't remove all the existing people. He wanted to see how true their hearts were. A similar statements may is made about when they wandered into wilderness and deuteron On May 8, it was a time of testing. And Deuteronomy 13. It says that God allowed false prophets to be among them to test them. God wants proven, strong people. You're familiar with his passage in Hebrews 12, where it talks about discipline, and testing. And the writer says, Don't scorn the Lord's discipline, discipline is teaching a wall an obstacle can be a time of teaching and discipline. Don't Don't scorn the Lord's discipline or give up when he corrects you. The Lord's just don't the Lord disciplines, the one he loves. A time of testing is a time when God is showing his love. And towards the end of that, that scripture when he talks about fathers and how they discipline us for a little while, but God does so for our benefit, that we might share His holiness. It's a time of making his holy and set apart for his purposes as well. Later discipline produces the fruit of peace and righteousness for those who are trained by it. Part of our discipline is is facing obstacles in our life. And it's got to be a time of testing and discipline, because God is looking to set us apart as holy for his purposes. And then looking for the fruit that comes from that, that testing and training. God wants proven, and strong people he may choose not to remove your walk quickly. That might be for a purpose. For in Exodus 14, as we come to the end of that passage about the Red Sea incident, it was ultimately for the Israelites to hallow God in their hearts, and to give him glory. Thus, the Lord saved Israel that day from the hands of the Egyptians, and Israel saw the Egyptians dead on the seashore. In other words, they saw the salvation of God. Israel saw the great power that the Lord used against the Egyptians. And so the people feared the Lord and they believed in the Lord. And in the servant Moses, the outcome was exactly what God intended. They saw His salvation, and they believed and they feared, we need to remember those lessons on our own lives. A sobering thought, when we think about the fact that God knew exactly where he was leading his people to the Red Sea, and you continue to lead them there with the digit Egyptians in hot pursuit. God also knows that there's an obstacle in our future. But he's chosen not to remove it. He's leading us right towards it right now, in a lot of our lives. But let's remember that while he chooses to leave that there, it has a purpose for us. And later, we're going to talk about how do we face that then, when when we come upon that obstacle, we need to prepare ourselves. So a summary of some of these things. Why our obstacles happen? Why do they happen, they happen to test us, they happen to make us holy, set us apart, to humble us, to teach us joy, to learn to fear God and see his power, and to give glory to Him. So let's do talk about how do we react to them. It's, it's been on your experience in mind that some people deal with testing and obstacles for a long time and some people indefinitely. You remember, Paul's Thorn, which I alluded to earlier from Second Corinthians 12. In the verses previous to Verse seven, Paul had talked about how he was given a glimpse of heaven. And then he talks about how that God had given him a thorn that Satan was allowed to give him a thorn in the flesh. So how did Paul respond to this? First of all, he

Unknown Speaker  18:55
said, I think I know why it's because I wouldn't. So I wouldn't become too arrogant, because what I what I had been allowed to witness. But notice what he didn't do. In his response, you know, he didn't quit. He didn't take medication for it as prescribed today, you know, he didn't seek a support group. But what did God do? Or what did Paul do? He went to God. Three times I pleaded with the Lord about this, that it should leave me. Can't you imagine Paul, asking God, I could do so much more. If you just removed this thorn, I could do so much more for you in the kingdom. So he prayed three times about it. But God had a different plan. He said, My grace is sufficient for you his current gifts that he had given Paul, were enough for Paul at this time. I think this is an important point. God or I'm sorry, Paul wanted relief from this burden. But there's two ways Is to relieve. They can come by come by removing that load or that burden, or by strengthening the shoulder of the one who bears that load. And that's the route that God chose. And instead of taking away the thorn, whatever it was, God strengthened Paul under it. And God would show his strength through Paul's apparent weakness. Christ's power is seen in man's weakness. And Paul accepted that wholeheartedly. He rejoiced that God had forced him to rely on the grace and strength of God. And that's how we should react to an obstacle. He says, For the sake of Christ, then I'm content with weaknesses, insults, hardships, persecutions and calamities for when I'm weak, and I'm strong. Because the power and the glory of God can be seen through me. That's the attitude that we should all strive for. God knew exactly what Paul needed, he was going to go on to face many trials in his life. And the lessons he learned from his Thornwood would carry him through those. Well, let's go back to the Red Sea again. The Israelites faced an unexpected obstacle there at the at the shore, they first reacted with fear, they complained to Moses, they blamed him. And then more, more unexpected result happened. God provided an escape, a solution that no one could have dreamed of. They crossed the Red Sea on dry land, and he took care of their enemies. Often, we just need to be still and not panic and keep trusting God. And he might provide an answer that we could never have thought of. First Corinthians 1013 says, no trial has overtaken you that is not faced by others. And God is faithful that he will not let you be tried beyond what you're able to bear. But with the trial will also provide a way out so that you may be able to endure it. That list of scriptural examples, let me look at those again. And let's, let's see how they reacted to their challenges. Well, Peter didn't expect to be challenged about being a close friend of Jesus. And at first he did handle that badly. He did deny the Lord three times. But to his credit, he later did repent, and he came a great leader. And in the early church, that person with the heart like rocky ground when you didn't expect that persecution, and when it came, he fell away. He did respond badly because he wasn't convicted and he did fall away. The rich young ruler, he told Jesus, he'd kept all those commandments. But when Jesus told him to sell his possessions and go and give them away, he couldn't do it. He couldn't get past that obstacle. He failed that test name and had to get over his pride. At first he did reject what Elijah told him to do, but then he relented. When he hit his obstacle. What did he do? He listened to the advice of others, and he complied. Listen, Second Kings five. Jonah chose to run instead of doing anything for the Ninevites and God had to intervene with a Piscean messenger. That's PBIS cin E. You can look it up later. When Jonah hit his obstacle, he listened to God and changed his ways. The Israelites had to trust God completely. When it came to defeating Jericho, they were obedient and successful. Even though the means to defeat the city was extremely unconventional.

Unknown Speaker  23:48
With Goliath, the Israelites were paralyzed with fear. And who knows how long they would have stayed there had not a young shepherd boy come along to deliver them. Once again. God provided an unexpected solution. Joseph thought the best thing to do for Mary was to divorce her quietly. But he listened to what the angel told him to do, even though the whole thing sounded crazy. And then with the Assyrians ready to attack, what could Hezekiah possibly do? Well, he could pray. And that's exactly what he did do. God heard and answered, and the next morning 185,000 Assyrians lay dead in the fields outside Jerusalem, who on either side, could have seen that coming. And when Daniel heard that the law banning prayer had been signed, it's it's important to see what he didn't do. He wasn't afraid. He didn't panic. He didn't complain. He just did what he always did. He prayed to God and Heaven. Well, that landed him in the lion's den. But God miraculously delivered him. And just before Shadrach, Meshach and Abednego were tossed into the fiery furnace, they told Nebuchadnezzar, our God can deliver us if he wants to. But if he chooses not to, they would still serve Him. Then not any image that any man set up, but God did chose choose to save them. Esther's decision to act actually put her in danger of losing her life, but she did act courageously, and do the right thing for her people. Now think about Joseph, Joseph of Genesis, he was doing everything right. There's no record that he complained when his brothers sold him into slavery. He was trust trustworthy and made the overseer in front of his house, he kept himself pure, and for his efforts, was thrown into jail. But he didn't complain there either. He didn't blame God, he or quit. But instead, he kept trusting God. He acknowledged that he had no control over his situation. He accepted it, and made the best of it. And we know that God was with him, even through those tough times. And eventually, after a long, long time, God elevated him, because God meant it for good. Genesis 50, verse 20. And going back to that man of Psalm 73, the envious man, it was, it was eating away at him. And it might have destroyed him until he went into the sanctuary of God. Until he had until he heard what God had to say about the destiny of the wicked. He finally understood that he had to leave it to God, to judge righteously, and just continue to serve God faithfully himself. The wicked were beyond his control, they were in God's hands, he would take care of them. And he just declared that he would tell the world all that God had done. So just quickly summarizing some of these examples. So how she would react to our obstacles, don't panic. Be still, God may show you a way out. Keep trusting him prepare for a possible persecution. Dump your pride, be open to advice, pray, but also listen to God through His Word. Be courageous, do what you know needs to be done. Acknowledged, there are some things beyond your control. Do your best even in a bad situation, and ask for strength to bear the load. There's a lot of lessons in those scriptural examples and many more. May we always see what God's trying to teach us through the lives of others in Scripture? So is it okay to pray that your obstacle be removed? If God is testing us to improve us and make us better? Should we pray for its removal? We'll remember that Paul did. Certainly, it's understandable and right to pray to remove what you think is a hindrance to your progress. But maybe God delays so you do pray. But God delays, it doesn't remove it. God's delay isn't God's denial. He may just be saying not now. For reason, he reasons he only knows he's he's not taking that wall down. If you trust God, and if you truly believe that he wants the best for us, you'll accept that delay. You'll go on living life, trusting God while facing that obstacle, but maybe you pray and you pray, and you pray, and the walls still there.

Unknown Speaker  28:46
If it's not being removed, maybe your wall is being left there for a reason. I think Paul came to understand that. And he understood that God would be glorified even even in his weakness. Because God knows exactly what he needed, and he knows exactly what we need. We always need to be patient and look for the lessons and learn from them. Usually people, all people respond in certain ways when an unexpected obstacle pops up. Usually, like the Israelites did with despair, fear, panic, blaming, jumping to conclusions, maybe saying, Well, God's punishing me with this. Or maybe they just quit. They just quit on life. They quit on God, they quit on others. Let me just suggest these these three things as far as reacting to, to obstacles, first of all, just just look. Look around you look at the situation. take an honest look of what's really happening to you and pray. Perhaps God will allow a way out that you're not seeing right now. Perhaps he will. There might be a solution but Also, it could be that God wants you to work through that situation. He wants you to learn about something through through the process. And some obstacles can actually be stepping stones. Maybe you need to go up over the wall. God wants you to perhaps step up your game and face that challenge. I'd say Secondly, learn. What's God's lesson? What is he teaching? You remember that God wasn't punishing Paul with his thorn, he was humbling Him. And God used him mightily in the furtherance of the gospel. Do you ask, when an obstacle, obstacle comes, why me lord? Or do you say, Well, why not me? We see have seen so many examples in Scripture. And there's so many more, where God threw up obstacles in people's lives. Why not? Us? Why not me? Why can't it happen to me? Why? Why do I think I'm special? Well, you know, maybe the special person is the one that receives the obstacle. And finally, live, live with your experience, if you have to live with your obstacle. Think about it, you're wiser, you're more experienced, your faith is stronger. Mike had a lesson about a month ago about mountain sized faith and how it moves mountains, any any obstacle we're facing, our faith can be stronger, we can be more patient, we can learn so many things with an obstacle in our life, although it may be difficult. Well, what if your wall is something like anxiety, a lot of people deal with anxiety, not knowing how things are going to work out you need more security and things like that. So many things like this require us to seek God's counsel. Consider when Abraham was called, he didn't know where he was going. I'm gonna quote now from one of Gary Henry's articles and diligently seeking God, quote, Abraham had enough confidence in the person of God, that he required little in the way of information about the plans of God. When called to leave his birthplace, he went out not knowing where he was going. Many would have demanded to know the destination, the itinerary, the timetable, and the purpose of the journey. But this great man was content to wait and see, Abraham's overriding interest was in showing reverence to God himself, and not in figuring out what God's next move might be. As for God's next move, Abraham would wait and see, you're wanting a map, he says, But I'm trying to give you a compass, unquote. So often, anxiety can debilitate us, it can be an obstacle or a wall to us. Obviously, the Israelites couldn't see the way to go as they stood on the shore of the of the sea. Abraham didn't know where he was going. But both were told to just wait and see, to trust in God. We may not have a map, but we do have a compass, we have direction in the Word of God. There's a connection between testing and opportunities. You may have heard this before. But as we work on developing qualities like patience and endurance and fortitude, when persecution comes, that's going to separate the true followers of God, from those that are just curious about God. When your faith faith has been tested, it either learns how to deal with difficulty or it's going to die.

Unknown Speaker  33:38
When faced with a crisis, an obstacle can maybe be called a crisis. Do we have the character to meet it or not? So how are we going to endure it with a Christ like spirit or with bitterness, there's a link in the in the Chinese language between the words crisis and opportunity. When written in Chinese the word crisis is composed of two characters, the one representing danger, and the one representing opportunity. Literally translated, it reads crisis is an opportunity writing the dangerous wind. When I was in architecture school and working on a design, I would tell my professor, I've got a problem with my design. And I had one particular professor that would say you don't have a problem, you've got an opportunity here. Took me a while to figure that out. But we need to grow to the point where we see difficult life situations as occasions for growth and service. If we take all the risk out of life, we're taking away all the opportunities as well. So are we looking for the easy way out or are we facing the hardships head on? If we work hard on life's obstacles, we'll learn little by little to master them. You may have heard this as well to share And a harbor is safe. But that's not what ships are built for. So my last point is using your obstacle. A couple points before I get to my main point, we may observe what others are going through with their obstacles, don't diminish what others are going through, you might think that it's very minor, that what they're going through is very minor. But what might seem small to you may very be very huge to other people. Because we're all equipped differently, we have different sets of capabilities and strengths and differences. Let's always put ourselves in other shoes, and be compassionate. And also, you might see others with what we might call no obstacles in their life. They're, they're just happy and joyous all the time. You and you just ask why. How could they possibly be like that all the time? Well, first of all, that's probably not true. It's just your perception may, most all people have something that they're either dealing with or have dealt with recently, that's that's could be extremely hard. That person you're thinking about maybe dealing with extreme pain and sorrow, and may have chosen just not to share it. Maybe not wanting to burden anybody else with it. And secondly, about those people that we think about, well don't rob them of their joy, you know, don't bring them down for being happy and joyous. Be glad that there are people around you they want to express their joy. And thirdly, I'd say about that. So what So what if their joyous? How was God dealing with you and your wall? How are you dealing with your wall? How are you bearing up with with your obstacle if you have one, we each have enough to be concerned about without complaining about others. So how can we help others with our experience, we've read a couple of things about how the man of Psalm 73 He dumped his envy he decided just to tell the world about God. Remember, in Psalm 51, which David wrote after his sin with Bathsheba, he learned from his sin and he taught others he said, I will teach transgressors your way, he was going to tell others about his experience of how to avoid it. As stated before, if we if we work hard on lifestyle, obstacles will learn little by little to overcome them will have greater confidence and will be able to serve others around us better. Because think about that when you've gone through, or what you've gone through is going to help others with their obstacles, because you're equipped with your experiences, and they may desperately need your help. And who knows whether you've not come to the kingdom for such a time as this. That may be your purpose. Think about what that obstacle taught you about what you learned about life, about God about people about yourself, the wisdom you've gained, and what a counselor you can be now to other people. And that's how we help each other down the path. Bear one another's burdens and so fulfill the law of Christ. Galatians six, verse two. A related point we need to think about too, is am I someone's Thorn, in my someone's obstacle. It might be in a wall to someone and in some way, so let's be aware of how we treat others and how we might affect them. There's enough unexpected trials in life, let's not add to someone else's burden. So let me summarize this quickly.

Unknown Speaker  38:37
It's metal meditate on what God has taught us in that experience. Let's internalize it. Let's make it part of this as we mature as Christians. Let's be aware of those around us that may be facing obstacles. Let's share it. When the opportunity arises. Let's counsel someone and don't be an obstacle to others. Well, the greatest example of someone facing an obstacle is of course, our Lord as He faced the cross. He prayed that his wall, his obstacle, his cup, the suffering and death he was about to face could be taken away. And as Paul prayed concerning his thorn, Jesus made His request three times as well. What what makes this obstacle a little bit different from the others we've discussed is that Jesus knew it was coming. But it was of no fault of his own. He was sinless. But this was a unique situation. The magnitude of it, though, made him beseech the father to remove it. But the father said, No. Jesus had to face the ultimate trial, the only way to get through it was to suffer through it, disregarding the shame of the cross. We are the beneficiaries of his obstacle. We see his strength, his attitude, his love, his obedience as he endured, but far greater we have life because of his Death, and we have hoped for heaven. So using that examples, let others be the beneficiaries of our obstacles in life. We have a great family here at Broadmoor, and many have faced unexpected obstacles and displayed great courage and strength, and some had been heartbreaking and others are heartwarming. I don't have to name names, you know who they are, but personal lessons have been learned. And some have shared those shared what they learned with us, some that found strength that they never knew they had. And they gain new insights about how God works. And they found out more about love. And I'd like to share just just a couple of thoughts. As we bring our lesson to a close about what some of these brothers and sisters have written. One brother wrote, It took suffering to teach me how to really be happy, thankful and content. But now because of my illness, and the lessons it taught me, I can enjoy the life I've been blessed with so much more. Suffering is a unique time for God to teach us lessons we need to learn. And a sister wrote, life will wear you down and make you consider quitting. But when you have no motivation, you have to have the discipline to do what you need to do anyway. Discipline is made up of commitment and sacrifice. And honestly, that's what it takes to keep taking step after step when you don't have the will to. And another wrote, the disease nearly took everything from me. After months of suffering, I gave up. I was just so tired, tired of fighting. Then I realized I didn't have to fight. I needed to completely surrender to God and put my life in his hands. And that was the moment I really began to heal, the disease took away but it also gave, I learned that disease may try to destroy our bodies, minds and spirits, but they only win if we let them. God is bigger than any disease or symptom. Life is full of suffering and trials. But the compassion of even one person can make a huge difference. And finally, we live every day celebrating the small victories that the rest of us take for granted. This journey has been and will be like climbing a mountain full of thorns, wrong turns and aching muscles. But at the end of the path, there's this amazing view that makes all of the obstacles worthwhile. What a beautiful metaphor of our struggles on hip on on Earth and our reward of heaven. I know there's many here who have had major obstacles in their lives and have not shared them, or shared them with very few. And my hope is that you face them with strength, and to learn and learn the lessons that God intended to teach. And even though they may have seemed unfair, and you did but you didn't reject God, you didn't give up that you continue to trust Him no matter what. And even though you might not understand now, and it might really hurt. God means that offer good. And even though that good may be difficult to see and not be seen for a long, long time. God means for your benefit. And that you'll use your experience to serve to in service to Him.

Unknown Speaker  43:05
So let's not be like the Israelites who forgot what God had done for them. Let's remember all that God has done for us no matter what happens. No matter what happens. There's nothing so hard and there's nothing that doesn't make life worth living. There's nothing to make a shake our fist at God because He has provided the greatest gift ever. He sacrificed his son for us. He gave us life and you gave us hope. And if we live in poverty the rest of our lives, if we must care for a sick relative for years, if we must live with a sickness or disability if we must pick up, put up with difficult people, it'll all be worth it. If we remember what God has done, we don't panic. We don't fear if we don't blame if we don't despair. And if we don't retreat, let's learn from every situation, every event, whether good or bad. What did I learn about myself and how to deal with other people and about God. Remember what Joseph told his brothers that God meant it offer good Remember Job that while suffering through his pain, he never thought that he would be blessed even more than he was than at the first. And I know I've gone long. Quickly, Romans five three through four not only that we rejoice in our sufferings, knowing that the suffering produces endurance and endurance produces character and character produces hope, counted all joy my brother's when you meet trials of various kinds and both of these passages What's the key word? It's rejoice and joy. Bless it as a man who remained steadfast James 112 and Romans 210 tells us to to be steadfast and faithful in our testing, we will have tribulation but be faithful unto death and I will give you a crown of life. That's the lesson. Hope it was beneficial. Sorry, I went a little bit long. You here this morning. You know Need to respond to God's invitation in some way we'll ask you to come and as we stand and say the song together
