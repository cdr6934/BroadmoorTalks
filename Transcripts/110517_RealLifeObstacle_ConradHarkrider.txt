Romans chapter five beginning in verse three

Conrad Harkrider  00:38
Paul says, and not only that, but we also glory and tribulations, knowing that tribulation produces perseverance, and perseverance, character, and character hope. Now hope does not disappoint because the love of God has been poured out in our hearts by the Holy Spirit who was given to us. Do you ever in your mind, think about the past? You ever go back to a moment in your life and replay the events? Kind of like watching a movie on rerun? Do you ever think to yourself? What would have happened if I would have done something differently? How would that have turned out if I would have made a different choice? Tonight, I want to talk to you this morning norm, discuss the topic of obstacles. And tonight I'd like to share with you a real life obstacle. Something that happened to me a couple of years ago, and after going through that experience, and reflecting on it, I want to share some of the lessons and new perspectives that I gained as a result of that. In June of 2015, my wife and I and our two kids made a long drive down to Dallas, Texas. We went for two purposes, to see friends and family and to play in the annual summer softball tournament, not my wife, just me. And I had convinced her to wrangle a two year old and a six month old all day long, in the Texas heat at a outdoor sports complex, while me and some of my college buddies would get out on the field and play little ball. Adult softball is is a great thing. Whether you are in great shape, or not so great shape, whether you practice all the time or you haven't practiced in ages, you can still get out there and put on a jersey. And so we did, I was out playing left field, if you're not familiar with that, which I was talking to someone this morning who didn't know much about baseball, but that's basically standing about 50 yards away from the other players. And you just wait for the balls to come out to you. And our second game that we're playing, there was a ball that was hit to shallow left field, which means I had to run in to try to catch it. And I'm coming in at full speed. And as I approach the ball, I start to sense or see someone out of my peripheral vision. And at the very last moment I pull up, I slow down, put on the brakes. It just so happened that the shortstop, who was also one of my best friends from college was coming out for the ball. And he stopped at the last moment. And the ball just dropped down on to the field. Now the other teammates on the field, they didn't say it, but I know they were thinking what are you doing? We're trying to win a game here. You know this. We're keeping score. So make an effort. And anytime there's a scoreboard involved, people tend to get a little competitive. So a few games later we were in to the elimination round and now it was getting serious this is when or go home. Everything's on the line. And so you got to play every play like it's your last least that's that's the mentality and in the second inning of the game, still out in left field, there was another pop fly that came in shallow left. And for this one my mentality was, I am not going to let it drop. And so I just came in 10 yards 1520 25. Now I'm at full speed running with my head up, my arm out, and my teeth gritted with full determination just to catch this thing.

Conrad Harkrider  05:32
As I get to the ball, instead of pulling up, or slowing down or sliding, I lean forward, lunging for the prize. And I wish I could see a replay of this. You know the type where you've got 10 cameras all around from every different angle just happen watch it in frame by frame as it happened. Because as I was falling forward, I saw the ball go in to my glove. And then boom. Unfortunately, my determination and intensity was equally matched by the shortstop who was also coming for the ball. And we collided head to head at full speed. People who are watching it or who were at the park said that it sounded like the crack of a wooden bat. My friend Travis did a complete one ad in the air landed on his back, I was down face first in the grass. The point of contact was the left side of my head and the bottom of his chin. Travis was immediately taken to the hospital. And he had a series of X rays that revealed he had broken his jaw in three places. He cracked it down the center in to two. And then he had broken both of his kondiles which I'm told is what connects your jaw to the top of your your school. weeks later, he would have multiple surgeries, he had to have a metal plate put in to his jaw to hold everything together. They took these metal wires and they strung it through his gums and then put bands around the wires to kind of hold everything in place. He said that he lost about 15 pounds in the process trying to eat his food through a straw being on that soft food diet. After he was well into his recovery, he told me later he said there's no doubt in my mind, you have a hard head My situation was a lot different in that I didn't go to the hospital. In fact, I went back into the game. It was it was a dumb decision, looking back on it. But at the time I felt okay and felt like I could get back out there and continue to play. And so that's what I did. It wasn't until weeks after the weekend, the following week when I tried to go back to work and get on the computer and stare at a screen that I realized I was suffering from the effects of a concussion. And so I would visit various doctors and seek help and eventually ended up taking about three weeks off of work to try to rest and recover. If you've never dealt with a concussion or head injury, it's basically sensitivity to any type of visual stimulation. So you think great three weeks off from work that sounds like a vacation but imagine not being able to watch TV, listen to music, read books, stare at a computer. Be in a bright room. I basically laid on the bed with a towel over my eyes for that period of time. After returning to work, I continued to deal with symptoms. I didn't exercise for about 12 months. I went from running around at full speed on the softball field to not being able to go on a walk with my family. My wife got tired of me coming into the room and turning off the lights because it was just difficult for me to be anywhere where there was a lot of stimulation. There was a lot of questions that went through my mind. You have an opportunity to do some thinking when you're laying on your back for that period of time. And so I'll share just a few of those with you. One of them was, why did this happen to me?

Conrad Harkrider  10:30
I've played sports my entire life, I've been on the field 1000s of times, and never gotten hurt like this. There are people who go to the major leagues and play professional sports that never suffer this type of traumatic injury. Even the other young men who were out there playing that day, there was over 100 other guys, and no one came off the field hurt, except for the crack jaw guy, but everybody else came away. Okay. So why did this happen to me? I also thought, how long is this going to last? When you're young, you typically get sick and you feel bad for a few days, and then your body starts to get over it, and you're back to doing what you've always done. But this was the first time in my life where it was three months, six months, a year. And I started to think to myself, I guess this is just the new normal, this is what it's going to be like for me. Random headaches, trouble remembering things having to go to bed early because you just don't feel right. And then there's what's going to happen down the road, you start to think out and project ahead and think about the future. What does this mean for me? Am I going to have to have some type of surgery to correct this? Is this going to be a danger for me? If I ever get hit in the head again, will that kill me if I get in a car accident? And you start to develop a sense of fear of life where everything around you just feels like a hazard? Like an injury waiting to happen? Well, as I worked through these questions, and, and thought about some of these different aspects of of dealing with something like this, I want to share a few of the lessons that I've learned through that process. First of all, there was an acknowledgement of reality. After I had had time to process what had occurred, and really think about it, think about other people who had gone through similar types of experiences. And think about what could have happened and what did happen. There was this realization of where I was at the fact that even though I was going through something difficult that my family was going through something challenging, I realized that this was not the most terrible thing that could have happened to me. After the play, I got up and walked off the field. Some people who get hit like that never walk again. My MRI showed no permanent structural damages, I went back to work within a couple of months. And even as I read about others who suffered from concussions and serious head injuries, I saw that I didn't have it as bad as many others. Even now, there are many of you sitting in this room tonight that could share stories about yourselves or family members that have gone through things that would far surpass what I'm describing, right now something that maybe lasted decades, not just a few years, or something that you carried with you for your entire life. But the fact is when you're going through it, no matter how small or minor, it may seem to other people, it's, it's a big deal to you. And it's difficult or challenging not to in order to have the right attitude, to keep the right perspective to not feel upset or annoyed or frustrated or even angry. But as you as I worked through a lot of those feelings It was hell For me to step back and remind myself what I still had, that no matter how bad I felt like it was, there were still blessings to be thankful for. In Hebrews chapter 12, and verse three, the writer says, Consider him who endured from sinners such hostility against himself so that you may not grow weary or fainthearted in your struggle against sin, you have not yet resisted to the point of shedding your blood.

Conrad Harkrider  15:32
The writer reminds them to think about Christ and everything that he went through, he suffered hostility and persecution, and ultimately was put to death at the hands of these evil men. He says, although you're facing adversity, it hasn't gotten to the point that it's cost you your life, you haven't made the ultimate sacrifice. Sometimes when we're in the trial, we feel as if we've been robbed of everything, we have no hope. We have no future, we have no happiness or joy. But that's why it's helpful to look to the Scriptures to see people who have gone through difficulties, who have faced the path and the realities of life and yet have maintained faith and trust in God. In the book of Ruth, the Bible tells us about Naomi, and how she lost her husband. And after about 10 years, the Scriptures tell us that She then lost both of her sons, her adult sons. When they only went back to Judah, she actually changes her name tomorrow, which literally means bitterness. She struggled with what she was going through, and why wouldn't she? Any of us would. But you see, God was able to take that very bitter situation. And those strong emotions and he was able to turn it into a blessing. We find her continuing to hope in God, trust in God looked to God. And ultimately he was able to provide a path for her. And then what about Joe, a man who suffered tremendously. He had great wealth and prosperity he had a family and numerous possessions. And yet it was all taken away from him. His children were killed, he was afflicted with painful boils from head to toe. How many of us have suffered physically and emotionally like that man. He was sleeping on the ground using a piece of pottery to scrape the sores off of his body. But look at what James chapter five and verse 10 says, as an example of suffering and patients, brothers, take the prophets who spoke in the name of the Lord. Behold, we consider those blessed who remain steadfast, you have heard of the steadfastness of job and you have seen the purpose of the Lord, how the Lord is compassionate, and merciful. He says, Look at the prophets and those who have gone before who have had to endure great hardship and adversity for the Lord. And then consider the intentions of God. After all that Job went through. His ultimate intention was to bless him another lesson that I learned from the experience, something that became very real to me was the uncertainty of life. The fact that your life can go from being one thing in one moment, and then transformed or changed into something completely different. In the next one day, everything is going great we are strong and healthy, we're having fun, life is going good. And then all the sudden that just gets flipped upside down, we get jolted into a new reality. Plans are rearranged pursuits have to get put on hold we get forced into a different direction with very little notice. In Ecclesiastes chapter nine and verse 11, the writer says again, I saw that under the sun the race is not to the swift nor the battle to the strong, nor bread to the wise nor riches to the Intel legit, nor favor to those with knowledge, but time and chance happened to them all. For man does not know his time like a fish, like fish that are taken in an evil net like birds that are caught in a snare. So the children of man are snared at an evil time when it suddenly falls upon them. The writer says that it's not those who are swift, or strong or wise or intelligent,

Conrad Harkrider  20:30
that will always have success, or achieve what they're looking for in this life, but time and chance happen to them all. Just by virtue of living in this world, we are subject to things that are out of our control. And the writer uses an image of a fish that is grabbed up in a net, something that happens suddenly and another unexpected. And we see that again. And again, in the world where we live, maybe it's a weather event, tornado, hurricane earthquake. Or maybe it's some type of accident, something with a car or when you're playing a sport, or hiking or something along those lines. Or what about an illness, everything is going fine, you go into the doctor for that checkup, and then all of a sudden, you receive this diagnosis that just completely alters your course. At any moment, our life can and probably will, at some point change drastically. So what are we supposed to do with that? How do we deal with that uncertainty of living in a world like this knowing that these things can happen to us? For me, it really put the focus on my priorities. And I step back and ask myself, what is it in my life, that is the most important thing to me. When things start to get taken away from you, or when your abilities are, are limited, you start to ask, What do I care about the most? What do I want most out of this life

Conrad Harkrider  22:30
and it really came back to my kids. I want to be there for for them. It's hard to be a father when you're laying in bed, dealing with the effects of an injury. And so I thought about the thing that I want most is to raise them, to provide for them to be able to teach them and bring them to maturity, it's not so much about my desires and what I want out of this life now. And so maybe running around diving for balls on the field is not the wisest thing to be doing. As one doctor told me, you've only got one brain, so you need to take care of it.

Conrad Harkrider  23:37
Isn't it true that all of us really only have one life? We've got one chance at living in this world. And our life can change and go a different direction at any moment. So how are we using the time that we have now? How are we living in the present? Are the short term decisions or the decisions now? Are they being made in light of our long term goals? Of what we want down the road in the future? Each one of us has been given a precious and valuable gift from God. Jesus said, what does it profit a man if he gains the whole world and loses his soul? And so the unchained the changing and uncertain nature of life should cause us to be sober to think about our lives. To think about how I'm living my life. How am I using my hands, my mouth, my abilities, my possessions? Am I using those things to glorify the One who created me? Or are my decisions? Are they more self serving? Are they more focused on my desires and what I want he reached out Have to 13 and verse five says, Keep your life free of the love of money and be content with what you have for he has said, I will never leave you, nor forsake you. And so it's not about amassing great amounts of wealth. That's not where our security and our assurance comes from. But this promise that God gives to us that He will never leave us or forsake us that keeps us grounded in the midst of uncertainty. And finally, I learned the tremendous value of support. When you're unable to do it for yourself, when you have to rely on others to help you. That's a that's a vulnerable position to be in. But yet, what it develops inside of you is this great sense of appreciation for the the people that are in your life. When you think to yourself, there's no way I could have done this without them. There's no way I could have made it on my own. And that certainly was the case for us. We had people that brought us food, again, and again. My wife kept saying I'm not injured, okay, I can still make dinner and the food came anyways. People wanted to help, they wanted to lighten the load. They reached out to us they checked on us, they asked us how you're doing they call they texted they sent cards. One brother sent me a video, text of encouragement. It was just a selfie of him talking into the phone, saying, Hey, man, how are you doing? Thinking about you and send it to me. And let me tell you after not being able to get out of the house for weeks, seeing another brother's face was a boost. Another brother brought over some oils. These are therapeutic oils. And I'll just tell you, when your head is hurting every day, you'll try anything. And so I rubbed those things on, religiously I've probably smelled like a pine tree for months. But different people showing kindness in different ways, expressing their love and their support. In second Corinthians chapter one and verse three, it says, Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies, and God of all comfort, who comforts us in all our affliction, so that we may be able to comfort those who are in any affliction, with the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted by God. When we receive comfort, what are we supposed to be doing with that we just hold on to it and enjoy it. Paul says with that when they received comfort, they distributed back out that they gave that comfort to others. That comfort should move us and serve us to provide and reach out to those in need. So maybe you're not in the valley right now. But someone else is someone else's in need of that strength that you possess.

Conrad Harkrider  28:39
And so what can we do to encourage our brothers and sisters who may be bearing alone in a vulnerable situation? One of the fruits of suffering is that it helps us to be more understanding. When we go through something difficult, and we realize what it feels like to be in that situation. After we come out of that it then equips us and allows us or prepares us to help someone else down the road we become more understanding we become more sympathetic. We are more sensitive to the pain of other people because we've been there ourselves. And so the woman who has a miscarriage, that's never something that she would pray for. It's never something that she would ask God for her to have to go through. And yet after she comes out on it on the other side, it's something that changes her. She views life in a different way. And she sees others differently and now she has a special way of relating to others who suffer the same thing. The point is, there is nothing new under the sun. And what happens to me has already been experienced by someone else. And in the future, someone else will go through that. So how can we use the difficulties or the obstacles in our lives to bless others? What if that obstacle is one of your gifts or one of your blessings, to use to help others? In First Peter chapter four and verse 10, it says, Each of you should use whatever gift you have received to serve others, as faithful stewards of God's grace in its various forms. Was this the worst thing that had ever happened to me? I hope so. But probably not. When we're in the moment of pain and hurt, we often think that there is nothing that could top this that this is this bad is it will ever get that the way that I feel right now, nothing could surpass this. But the reality is, if we live long enough, we will probably face another trial that is even greater. So maybe God is using this. Maybe he's using this that I'm going through right now to prepare me so that I can develop that character and that faith and that perseverance so that when a greater trial comes in my life, I can remain faithful and keep my hope and my trust in God. Perseverance produces character, and character produces hope. We're going to close with a final song and we use it as a time to encourage those who are here if there's something that we can do to pray with you to help you in your walk. With Christ, you can use this opportunity as we stand and sing
