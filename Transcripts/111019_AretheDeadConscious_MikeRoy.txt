We have come today to worship our God to assemble together, it's certainly one of the most thrilling things that we can do this day is to come and praise our awesome God to give Him the glory that He deserves to appreciate all the views done for us. We appreciate having so many with us today that we are here to honor God to praise him to remember the greatest sacrifice ever made on our behalf. But we are here to honor God and to remember our own mortality, we sometimes forget that but we're here just for a short period of time, remind myself I'm getting older. That happens to all of us. But we we assemble like this on a regular basis to to praise God and honor him appreciate all that's been done this morning, the songs that John led for us wonderful songs that are so powerful, to help us get our thinking where it needs to be the Lord separate thoughts to prayer, the Scripture reading. Sometimes I say, you know, what else do we need to do that then what we've already done, but I do have a message this morning. Once you to think about that with me recently, I spoke up in the East Cheatham church, and was given a couple of topics to choose from Jeremy probably did the same dirty sweets. And the question that I was given or really ended up choosing, was the question are the dead conscious? And so I decided to go ahead and tackle that. And there are a lot of unknowns about this question. But as I contemplated this particular question, do some research on it. And of course, preaching on it about a month or so ago, I it made me realize the magnitude of the significance to the answer of this question. It first there was a little bit hesitant when I said okay, I'll take that question that subject. But the more I jumped into this discuss this, this particular study, I realized how critically important the answer to this question is for every single person. And so the question is after, after you die? Will you have no consciousness of all that he have done in this life? No awareness of God and the coming day of judgment? Will it be a time of complete nothingness? In that existence with no recall over our lives? Or will it be a time we were totally conscious, fully conscious of our past live, and conscious of the approaching Day of Judgment? And so I picked this lesson recently. And, and I thought, it's the kind of question and lesson that we need to look at, honestly, as we evaluate our lives, and really just to take a look at this question. And what God's Word says about this, I want to say at the beginning of this lesson, that the only way to answer this question are the dead conscious, we first think about people who just died. The only way to answer that question is to know what God's Word says, We can speculate all day long. But you'll never know that so you can go to Tombstone. And maybe you think about the bodies underneath the tombstone and say, Are they conscious? You can look at somebody in a casket. Little Old Lady died, Is she conscious? While certainly the body is gone, the body is dead. In other picture and hit this lady even has some prayer beads wrapped around her fingers, are the dead conscious? Are they not conscious, and have no awareness of anything past or present, or even into the future? And so when you look at those pictures, there's no way that a human being can know whether there's consciousness there, but I do think if we get started, and this is a lesson that can be focused on answering this question, as opposed to looking at three or four or five scriptures, this is a verse that we have to take in mind as we think about these dead people that we just looked at in the the casket. The Rite of Ecclesiastes says this, remember him, before the silver cord is broken, and the Golden Bowl is crushed, the picture by the will is shattered, in the wheel at the cistern is crushed, then the dust will return to the earth as it was. So that's what was happening to these bodies, the dust was returning to their their will get getting ready to be buried, the dust will return to the earth as it was in the spirit will return to God who gave it. You have an eternal spirit eternal soul housed in your earthly body. And when that earthly body goes into the ground, something goes back to God. We call that your spirit. And so we're looking at the question this morning.

Mike Roy  04:48
Are the dead conscious and basically, I want to just break that down in two questions. The first question is right after a person dies, right after their death is that person still conscious? And then secondly, after the day of judgment, so I just put these together after the Day of Judgment will that dead person be conscious. So that's what we want to look at. In terms of how we're going to approach this lesson. I'm going to begin by looking at Luke chapter 16. And verse 19. Through 31, the story of the rich man and Lazarus, I'm gonna go ahead and read that and then make some observations from this particular text. It looks you have to 16 Verse 19. reading from the New American Standard Version, now there was a rich man, and he habitually dressed in purple and fine linen, joyously living in splendor every day, and a poor man named Lazarus was laid at his gate covered with sores in longing to be fed with the crumbs which were falling from the rich man's table. Besides, even the dogs were coming in licking his sores. Now the four men died, and was carried away by angels to Abraham's bosom. And the rich man also died and was buried in Hades, he lifted up his eyes being in torment, and saw Abraham far away, and Lazarus in his bosom. And he cried out and said, Father, Abraham, have mercy on me and send Lazarus so that he may dip the tip of his finger in water and cool off my tongue. For I am in agony in this flame, that Abraham said, Child, remember that during your life, he received the good things, and likewise Lazarus bad things. But now he is being comforted here, and you are in agony. And besides all this, between us, and you, there's a great chasm fixed, so that those who wish to come over from here to you will not be able, and that none may cross over from there to us, the universe 27 He said, Ben, I beg you, Father, that you send him to my father's house, for I have five brothers, in order that he may warn them, so that they will not also come to this place of torment. But Abraham said, They have Moses and the prophets, let them hear them. But he said, No, father, Abraham, but if someone goes to them from the dead, they will repent. But he said to them, if they do not listen to Moses, and the prophets, they will not be persuaded even if someone rises from the dead. So well known passage of Scripture, I want to use it in to get this lesson started, then we'd be looking at some Old Testament passages and some new as well. But I want you to notice when we look at this account in Luke chapter 16, and sometimes we raised the question, is this a story? Is it a parable? What is it in my point is it doesn't really matter what you label it. This is truth from God. And the question is what truth? But what truth? Is God teaching us from this story and from this parable? Well, there's a lot of them. I think, often we see that there are two extremes of life on Earth. Some people are very rich. And some people are exceedingly poor, destitute.

Mike Roy  08:05
But that's just the hard reality of life. I think this passage also teaches us that everybody dies. The rich person dies, the poor person dies, a person of faith dies, the person without faith dies, everybody dies. Very clearly, we see two extremes of reward and punishment. The Lazarus is in a place of comfort and consolation and and PS, the risk man is in a place of torment. So there's two extremes of comfort may be polar opposites, we might say, Lazarus has in his place of comfort, risk means in a place of torment, extreme reward, and extreme punishment. For if there's one message, or less than I think that that Jesus is teaching us here that after death, both men experienced full consciousness, we're raising the question this morning are the dead conscious, the rich man just died, just died. And Lazarus also died. And I think if there's one, one shocking truth that hits me right over the head, is the conscious painful torment of the rich man. They're both conscious. Lazarus is enjoying the peace in praise of Abraham's fellowship. But after death, both of these men experience full conscious of raising the question are the dead conscious? Well, Luke chapter 16 Sure indicates that they are. And maybe there's lots of questions about this text that I don't understand all the answers to, but these are some very plain true so after death, both of these men experience full consciousness the rich man who had everything in life possible. He didn't. He didn't help his neighbor like he should have. And Lazarus is now in a place of comfort system. To notice also that there's no relief for those who are in Hades. No relief is a shocking language, no relief at all. And so the rich man says Send lashes to get a cup of water and dip his finger in that cool my tongue, and it can't be done. There's no relief for those in Hades. Also, nobody can exchange places, even if somebody in a place of comfort, wanted to go to the place of torment to comfort someone who is in anguish, they couldn't do that. There's no crossing over. in either direction, are the ones that are in torment. They can't come to the place of comfort. And also, no one can come back to Earth after death, with a warning for this tripping. Isn't it interesting that the rich man thought that if somebody rose from the dead father Abraham, surely they'll listen, they'll repent, they'll change their life? And he said, No, they won't. They have Moses and the prophets. Let them listen to them. So a couple of really, I think, vital lessons that this text teaches us.

Mike Roy  11:05
And these are all is not new truths. We know this, we've seen these passages before. But the time to learn and obey the gospel of Christ is when we are alive. When you are dead, your opportunity to obey God's will is past. And so practically, we'd be thinking as this lesson will conclude in your little while, that if you haven't obeyed the Gospel, Jesus Christ and had your sins washed away, you need to do that today, while you have that opportunity. Once your body goes into the grave, there is no other opportunity, this is your opportunity. And that's what motivates me to preach and everybody else here to teach God's word to save souls before it is too late. And I think another important lesson from this text is that the revealed word of God is the last warning we will get no more visions, no messages from Heaven, no more revelations, nothing. The revealed God's Word of God, the message that we have is God's final announcement of the coming judgment and the promise of heaven. And so this text is very compelling to me, is just focusing on a simple question. Are the dead conscious? But Luke chapter 16, in the case, absolutely. They're conscious, fully conscious. The one who died in sin is fully conscious. The one who died in faith is fully conscious. So of Luke chapter 16. That's just one passage. Let me look at some others going to jump to the Old Testament for a moment, then we'll be looking at some passages in the New Testament. But I want to go back and let me forget this question. As I was contemplating this particular question, are the dead conscious? So here's my thought question for you all. Would God designed us and make us in such a way as as conscious human beings who live 7080 90 years, but then plan for an unconscious existence after our death? Think about that, would God make us as fully conscious thinking human beings, I preached a lesson recently called made to be filled. We're always taking in thoughts, ideas, food, whatever it may be, we spend a lifetime taking in information. And we're fully conscious so it God make us as conscious human beings and say, at the deathbed, I'm just gonna take an eraser, you have no recollection of anything in the past or the future. That makes sense to me. There's a reason why God made us conscious, because he wants us to consciously worship Him before the throne in heaven. So that's a question to think about. I'm gonna go back to a rewrote passage in First Samuel chapter 28. Not going to read all this here. But with the witch of the medium at Endor. Again, we're looking at the question are the dead conscious so in First Samuel chapter 28, Samuel is dead. Saul has been unfaithful to God. He's gathering up his army to fight against Felicity she's scared to death. And I'm just gonna kind of paraphrase some of these things here. He's trembling, the Lord's not answering him any more. And so he said to his servants, get a woman, a Sikh, a woman from for me, who I meet who has a medium that I might go to her and she could bring up a person that I want. So Saul disguised themselves more that went with a couple other guys there. Perhaps soldiers located this witch, this woman at this medium at Endor. And he says, I want you to bring somebody up for me. She said, Don't you know that Saul has removed all the mediums from the land and there's a death sentence on anybody who does this. And then Saul said, Of course, he's disguised. He said, You know, I

Mike Roy  14:46
he vowed that he would not let anything bad come through that she would not lose her life. So she said, Who should I bring up? So Saul says to the woman, this this medium who whom shot Shall I bring up and say Saul said, I want you to bring up Samuel. So she brought up Samuel, in verse 12, the woman's when the woman saw Samuel, she cried out with a loud voice. And the woman spoke to Saul saying, why have You deceived me for you? Or saw the king said to her, Do not be afraid? What do you see the woman said to Saul, I see a Divine Being coming up from the earth. He said to her, what is his form? And she said, an old man is coming up, and he is wrapped with a robe. And Saul knew that it was Samuel in the bow with the space to ground it did homage. So here's Samuel who's dead. Samuel is dead in the ground. In verse 15 theme that Samuel said to Saul, why have you disturbed me by bringing me up? He had been dead. And Saul answered, I'm greatly distressed for the Philistines waging war gives me God has departed from me not answering me by prophets or dreams. So therefore, I've called you that you might make known to me what I should do. Samuel said to him, this the dead man that raised up, why did you ask me since the Lord has departed from you, and has become your adversary, the Lord has done accordingly, as he spoke through Me, for He is the Lord has torn the kingdom out of your hand and given to your neighbor to David, and as you did not obey the Lord and did not execute his fierce wrath and emelec. So the Lord has done this thing to you this day. Then notice what else Samuel says, More, moreover, the Lord will also give. Moreover, the Lord will also give over Israel along with you into the hands of the Philistines. Therefore, tomorrow, you and your sons will be with me in the grave a lot of things that we may not know from this, this passage over here, but clearly is this medium brings up Samuel. He was conscious, and he knew God's scheme what was going on? So I just wanted to share that with you. It's more of a remote passage. But let's look at some passages in the New Testament. As we focus on this question, in Luke chapter eight, J versus daughter had died might recall this account and Lucia fate, Jesus does many miracles. And in verse 49, he was delayed because he's trying to help a woman who was hemorrhaging from blood. So in verse 48, while he was still speaking, someone from the rules house came and said, Your daughter is dead, did not travel the teacher anymore. But Jesus on hearing this answered him, do not fear only believe, and she will be well. And when it came to the house, he allowed no one to enter with him except Peter, and John, and James and the father and the mother of the child, and all will weeping and mourning for her. But he said, Do not weep, for she is not dead. But sleeping, and they laughed at him knowing that she was dead. So here she is dead. First 54. But taking her by the hand, he called saying Child, Arise, Leah was 55. And Her spirit returned. This is a dead person. What happened to the Spirit? Well, please, yes, you kept it. Well, the spirit goes back to God. So bodily she died. Her spirit came back. We don't just have physical body. So we have, we have spirits. We have souls that were designed by God, to live on forever. So we were looking at the Scripture at the question are the dead conscious? They sure are. Because it's not just the body, the body's gone, are in the ground. But there's the spirit. Look in the book of Revelation with me, John is trying to encourage Christians in the first century, who are facing tremendous persecution, some of them being put to death. And so he's given a series of visions and revelations there to encourage the Christians and an opening of different seals. So in verse nine, it says, When he opened the fifth seal, he said, I saw under the altar, the souls of those who had been slain for the Word of God and for the witness they had born. So in John sees his vision designed to encourage him, he said, I saw under the altar, the souls of those who have been slain for the Word of God. These are Christians who had been martyred for their faith, they've been murdered. They've been put to death for serving God. And when John gets this vision, from God from Jesus Christ, He sees souls who are under the altar their bodies, many of them had been burned to the stake,

Mike Roy  19:34
literally, by the Roman authority have burned at the stake. In his vision, he saw their souls under the altar. Hmm, what are they doing there? Well, verse tan, the souls cried out with a loud voice. Oh, Sovereign Lord, holy and true, how long before you will judge and avenge our blood on those who dwell on the earth or the dead conscious surely they're conscious here they're worshipping God to the crying out for vengeance for relief. And then in verse 11, then they were each given a white robe, and told to rest a little longer, until the number of their fellow servants and their brothers should be complete, who are to be killed as they themselves had been? So here's a picture where these Christians in the first century were put to death, for serving God. And in this vision to encourage John in the first century Christians and the Roman Empire, he saw a vision of the souls of these departed Christians, and they're, they're engaged in prayer and worship and pleading with God. So again, every time we look at this question are the dead conscious. Again, the point I make here that many of these Christians, their bodies were incinerated, it was gone. Their bodies were totally, totally destroyed, yet their spirit lives on. Look at another passage. Excuse me with me. And Jude, in verses five, six, and seven, this is talking about some the fallen angels that were who are cast down into a place of judgment. And you've said in verse five, said, Now I desire to remind you though, you know all things once for all that the Lord after saving of people out of the land of Egypt, subsequently destroyed those who did not believe in angels who did not keep their own domain, but abandoned their proper abode. He has kept in eternal bonds under darkness for the judgment of the great day. So these angels didn't remain in a place of submission and obedience to Almighty God. But God basically kicked them out of heaven, and cast them sisal here, he has kept them in eternal bonds under the day of under darkness for the day for the judgment of the great day. So this is talking about angels, I know that we're in a time up, to have beings that die. But these angels are cast down to this, this this dungeon type of place, they're in darkness. What's the significance of darkness? It's conscious to be to use the language of darkness, it means they knew they were in darkness, when in Matthew chapter 25. And Jesus says, Cast the worthless slave into outer darkness. Why? If there's no consciousness, you couldn't experience Him. But to be in outer darkness means it's fully we're fully conscious. So that's the state with these fallen angels here. Then he goes on to say, just a Sodom and Gomorrah and the cities around them, since they in the same way offs, as these adults in gross immorality, and went after strange flesh, are exhibited as an example and undergoing the punishment of eternal fire. So in God reign fire and brimstone down on Sodom and Gomorrah, in those surrounding regions. He said, That was an illustration of the eternal fire, awaiting those who are impenitent Is this a strong language Brevin, France, not eat to eat the talk about to preach, but if we're gonna be faithful to God's word, this is the only the only source that we can go to. So Jude shows us very clearly that these angels were fully conscious. These were disobedient angels. A couple more passages before we wrap up the lesson. Another very compelling passage, or Revelation Chapter 14, again, we see ultimately the the fate of those who are impenitent, and disobedient to God. But in particular, this section deals with the doom of the the worshipers of the beast, those who bow down to Satan, those who bowed down to false gods or whatever, these are people who are disobedient to God. So in this, this continuing series of visions, this week, John gets to see that another angel, a third one followed them, saying with a loud voice, If anyone worships the worships the beast and his image in receives a mark on his forehead or his hand, it says that he will drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is mixed in full strength of the cup of his anger, and he will be tormented with fire and brimstone. I just have to slow down for just a moment. Because this is this is utterly shocking, language

Mike Roy  24:36
written given to us by God. So those who receive the mark of the beast worship this image, are going to drink of the wine of the wrath of God, which is mixed in full strength and a cup of his anger, and he will be tormented with fire and brimstone in the presence of the holy angels, and indifference. resonance of the Lamb of the dead conscious of those who die and cry or die outside of Christ, are they conscious? Sure looks like to me. Again, very, very compelling language over here. And then it says, verse 11, in the smoke of their torment goes up forever and ever. And they have no rest, day and night. So again, I say that this is this is shocking language. And and first of all, I believe that this text destroys the idea that the wicked are just going to be annihilated. Do these verses that we're looking at here, teach that sinners will face the wrath of God, and then they're just obliterated from the earth? Not at all, what we see in this this passage is conscious, endless suffering. And so it does leave provoke some questions. Why would a loving God who made us in His own image, in likeness use such graphic, horrific language as it relates to punishment? Why would he do that? Because he doesn't want you to go there. He doesn't want me to go there. That's why he uses that kind of language. Why would we? Why do we use strong labor with our children to tell them Be careful about driving fast on the roads, because we don't want them to get hurt. So God uses language like this, that gets our attention. He does not want his people that he made it his own image to be lost. It's it's, it's it's horrific language. A second question relating to that. What else is God saying about? Or lessons is God teaching us here? I think he's teaching us of the the horror, and how horrible and offensive sin is to God, we make light of sin. We scoff at it. We turn on television, we go to movies where people dress on a silver screen, people sleep with each other, they get drunk, they murder, they rape, they lie, they do all kinds of things. And God, God is offended by that, he is not going to tolerate that. And so we look at these passages. And they show us that there is consciousness, after the point of death, immediately after death, and also after the day of judgment. So again, these are, these are verses that we have to look at, because this is the hand of God that these are the words of God. And it's our obligation to, to find out what God is saying. And then to be fully obedient to what he says a couple of the verse actually one of the verse that I want to look at with you this morning, and John chapter five, and verses 24 through 29. So Jesus is talking about the upcoming resurrection from the dead. And he says, Truly, truly, I say to you, he who hears my word, and believes Him who sent Me, has eternal life and does not come into judgment. But as passed out of death into life. He said Truly, truly I say to you in our is coming in now is when the dead will hear the voice of son of gods who are looking at the question, are the dead conscious? Well, here Jesus would be calling to the grave to the tombstones and the dead will listen to nothing with the time not just their bodies, talking about their their souls, and those who here will live for just as the Father has life in himself, even so he gave to the Son also to have life in himself. And he gave Him authority to execute judgment, because he is the Son of Man, that he said in verse 28,

Mike Roy  28:55
do not Barlett this, for an hour is coming in which all who are in the tunes will hear His voice, it will come for those who did the good deeds to a resurrection of life, and those who committed evil deeds to a resurrection of judgment. So when we look at all the scriptures, and we looked at random ones Old Testament in the New Testament, clearly, the Bible teaches that the dead are conscious. Physically, the body's gone. Some of them, like we said, were burned at the stake. But the dead are caught, their souls are conscious, their spirits are conscious. They're conscious right after they die. And they're conscious after the day of judgment. So this is a I don't have all the answers to all the scriptures that we looked at. But clearly, I believe God is teaching us that there is life after death, and that the dead are conscious whether we die in Christ, or outside of Christ. We see in Scripture, that consciousness is there. So the question I want to close with as we extend the invitation is this question in view of our eternal no consciousness, have you obey the will of God? That's really the only question to focus on, and viewer the fact that we will be eternally conscious. The only issue is, do I love my maker do I love my god but I love Jesus Christ Am I willing to obey his will? The way that we become Christians we say this with with frequency is we believe that Jesus is the Christ must be willing to repent of our sins, then we must be willing to confess our faith in him and then submit the Gods command to be baptized as part of the board again process of dying to self dying to sin, and then dying with Christ and baptism. If there's any here this morning who needs to respond to the gospel in any way we invite you to come while we stand and sing this invitation song
