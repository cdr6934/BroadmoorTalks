Do you want to turn in your Bibles to Philippians chapter four?

Conrad Harkrider  00:23
If you were to traveled around to different parts of the country, you would start to see characteristics among the people that lived in particular areas. There are certain traits that are common to people who live in geographic areas in the South. There are some generalizations that people down here use words like y'all and that we talk a little slower. And that we like fried chicken national has the hot chicken, people drive hundreds of miles to get a taste of that stuff. But there are certain assumptions that you can make about a group of people based on on where they live. For example, if if you tell me that you're from Kentucky, I might assume that, that you like basketball, and that you're a UK fan that you enjoy watching horse racing, and that you own at least one pair of overalls. Now, maybe not all of those are true. But think about what is common to a group of people from from an area. And now think about what are the common traits and characteristics of a Christian. If you tell someone that I am a believer, I'm a follower of Christ, what can now be assumed about that person or what can be assumed or inferred about us. In the fourth chapter of Philippians, Paul is bringing his letter to this church to a close. And as he concludes his instruction to them. He emphasizes the character of those who are in Christ. He details how those who are in Christ are to act, how they think, how they interact, or conduct themselves with one another. And he shows us the character because we're in Christ. These are the qualities that we exhibit. So read with me in Philippians chapter four, beginning in verse one. It says, Therefore, my beloved and long for brethren my joy and crown, so standfast in the Lord, beloved, I implore you, odia and I implore cinta ki to be of the same mind in the Lord. And I urge you also true companion help these women who labored with me in the Gospel, with Clement also, and the rest of my fellow workers whose names are in the book of life. Rejoice in the Lord, always again, I will say, rejoice. Let your gentleness be known to all men, the Lord is at hand. Be anxious for nothing but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God. And the peace of God which surpasses all understanding will guard your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus. Finally, rather than whatever things are true, whatever things are noble, whatever things are, just whatever things are pure, whatever things are lovely, whatsoever things are of good report, if there is any virtue and if there's anything praiseworthy, meditate on these things. The things which you learned and received and heard and saw in me, these do, and the God of peace will be with you. In this section, there's an emphasis on the phrase in the Lord. I'll draw your attention to those in verse one. He says, to stand fast in the Lord. Verse two we are to be of the same mind in the Lord. In verse four, he says, To rejoice in the Lord. In verse seven, he says, that he will guard your hearts and minds through or in Christ Jesus,

Conrad Harkrider  04:39
I believe what Paul is emphasizing here is that it is all about the Lord, our hope, our purpose, our joy in living, everything that we have is found in the Lord. And because we are in Christ, and we're are a part of this body that changes the way that we live. That changes how we see the world how we treat our brothers and sisters. First of all, notice that because we are in Christ, we strive for unity. Unity is not a new topic just being brought up here in chapter four. Paul has addressed this previously, in the letter in chapter two, and verse two, he says, fulfill my joy by being like minded, having the same love being of one accord, of one mind. There is a common bond that exists among the family of God. We have the same love the same mind we are working and moving in the same direction. Notice in chapter four and verse one, the terms that Paul uses to address these brothers and sisters, he says, My beloved, my long four brethren, he refers to them as his joy and his crown. These are people that are very near and dear to his heart, and that is that there is this close familial bond that exists among God's people, there should be unity and togetherness in the body. But notice, Paul does something very interesting in chapter four and verse two. Look what he says I implore you, odia. And I implore cinta Ki, to be of the same mind in the Lord. Paul specifically mentions to women by name. Now remember that when this letter is given to the church at Philippi, they would have taken that and brought it into a public assembly, and it would have been read front, front to back from beginning to end in the presence of the congregation. And I want you to imagine sitting there listening to this being delivered publicly, and you're hearing the things about rejoicing and about the mind of Christ and about togetherness, and then you get to this point in the letter, and all of a sudden your name is mentioned. Specifically, I implore Sally and Jane to get over their disagreement to be of the same mind probably was a little uncomfortable for these ladies. So why would Paul do this? Well, first of all, I

Conrad Harkrider  07:33
think it shows us that this is a real group of people. These are real individuals with real problems, it's not too hard to imagine that within a group of Christians, there would be some disunity some disagreement or friction that's going on in the church. Another reason that he may mention them by name is because this is important. This is not just something that Paul intends to overlook, but he calls special attention to it. Because the stakes are so high, he doesn't want the church to be further damaged or even destroyed by some type of disagreement or dispute that may be going on notice the language that he uses. I implore I intreat. He is urging these women to be on the same page. Notice that he addresses both of them. He doesn't just say Euodia needs to get over her. Her issues with Cynthia key, right? It's not just directed at one of them. Both of these ladies have a stake in this so often in relationships, both parties play a role in bringing those sides together, reconciling and resolving whatever issue may be at hand. Unity is critical for the health of the body. Paul goes a step further in verse three. Notice what he says, I urge you also true companion help these women who labored with me in the gospel. He now brings another person into the equation, this true companion not sure exactly who this was possibly one of the traveling companions that Paul went to various places with maybe Luke. Or maybe it's the person who delivered the letter to the church and he's urging them to help in this matter, or perhaps it's just one of the elders or the Deacons in this congregation that's going to assist in this matter, but regardless, he asked this person to help these women. Sometimes we need an outside person to step in, to assist to bring two sides together to bridge that gap. an outside perspective can help me see maybe something that I'm overlooking, maybe something that I've rushed to judgment on? Do we find ourselves playing a positive role when there's a conflict between two brothers or sisters? Or are we more likely just to pull back? Not get involved? I don't want to get in between whatever's going on there. Or even worse. Do we take sides? Do we talk to other people? Did you hear what God has said about cinta Q, and interject our own thoughts. And instead of bringing two people together, we make matters worse. unity in the body of Christ is everyone's responsibility. Whether I'm in a disagreement with another brother, or if I see something going on, that's there's an issue all of us play a role in keeping that bond of peace and love together. You didn't he means that we strive to help not harm brothers and sisters. And notice verse three, these are not the outcasts of the church. These are not people on the fringe. He says that these ladies labored with him in the gospel, they were his fellow workers. Even key or very integral parts of the body can come and have disagreements, God wants unity among all of his members, the elders, the deacons, the families, the older members, that we would all be joined together. Notice what he says at the end of verse three, the whose names are in the book of life. He reminds them who their disagreement is with these are God's chosen people, they are enrolled in heaven. They are citizens of God's kingdom. And maybe what Paul is trying to point out is that if we are going to spend eternity with these people, can we not find a way to be at one at one with one another and unified here and now in the present? And chapter two, and verse three, Paul says this chapter two and verse three,

Conrad Harkrider  12:24
Let nothing be done through selfish ambition or conceit. But in lowliness of mind, let each esteem others better than himself. We think about well, it's so hard to get along with these types of people we are, we're just different. We buttheads. We need to ask ourselves if we are acting upon selfish ambitions, are we considering others more important than ourselves? One of the character traits of God's people is that they strive to be unified. Also notice that because we're in Christ, we rejoice in the Lord. Rejoice in the Lord, verse For Rejoice in the Lord always again, I will say, rejoice, rejoicing and joy, as mentioned 14 times in the book of Philippians. It's a common theme that comes up again and again, look at another instance of this chapter three and verse one. Finally, my brethren Rejoice in the Lord, for me to write the same things to you is not tedious. But for you, it is safe. Paul just keeps banging on this drum again and again, Rejoice in the Lord, rejoicing does that mean that we are happy all of the time? Is there a difference between rejoicing and joy and happiness? I believe there is happiness is a feeling that we have, it's often tied to our immediate circumstances. I win the game and I am happy I get a free lunch and that makes me feel happy. There are positive feelings that come as a result of things that are going on around the good things that are happening. An example of this is from the Old Testament, you remember Jonah? God sent him to the city of Nineveh and he came out after preaching to the people he came outside of the city and he was waiting to see what was going to happen and God caused a plant to grow up around him to provide shade and comfort to him. And in Jonah chapter four and verse six, it says that Jonah was extremely happy about the plant. That was good for him. He he enjoyed that. But remember what happens the next day Jonah wakes up God sends the worm. The plant dies, it withers, the Sun begins beating down on his head. And Jonah says that it would be better for me to die than to live Jonah for eight. What happened in that one night his circumstances changed, his environment was different. And it caused his emotions to go from extreme happiness on one end to utter despair. Think about where Paul is writing these things. From chapter one in verse seven, he mentions his chains. He is in a Roman prison. Paul was not a thief, he was not a murderer or a criminal. And how can someone who has been unjustly and unfairly put into prison? How can they be rejoicing? How can they be telling others to rejoice? because joy is not the same as happiness. Joy is something that is deeper. It's grounded not on my situation, but rather upon the promises and the unchangeable blessings that God has given to us. It's not tossed and turned by the winds of life, it is protected by the solid promises of God. Do you notice the source of our joy and rejoicing? He says it is in the Lord. That's where we find great joy. If we try to have our rejoicing in the stock market, one day it's up the next day it's down we are in for a wild ride. If we try to have our rejoicing in our job security, we're setting ourselves up for disappointment because there is nothing in this life that is constant and sure and guaranteed.

Conrad Harkrider  17:13
But when we rejoice in the Lord, we're putting our trust in something that never changes. It's never going to go away. He is the same yesterday, today. And forever. Hebrews 13, in verse eight. Notice verse five, he says, Let your gentleness be known to all men. The Lord is at hand these these traits that we're talking about, they should be visible, they should be evident to all men. Your reasonableness, your gentleness, this is a person who is considerate they think about others. That quality should be seen by the person at the counter. The one who is taking my order the people that I work for and work with. And even the people that share the same roof is me and my family. He is reasonable. She is gracious. This is a person who lives with joy in their hearts. We can rejoice because at the end of verse five, he says the Lord is at hand. This may be referring to a timing the Lord is coming he is near he is approaching. But it could also be referring to proximity the Lord is near to us he is close by. He is within reach. No matter what is happening to us whether we're facing great prot great trials or persecution or difficulty. The Lord is near He will never leave us or forsake us. He provides strength and comfort to all who call on his name. And in that we can have great rejoicing. Verse six says Be anxious for nothing but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving. let your requests be made known to God. Because we're in Christ, we replace anxiety with prayer. Anyone here ever worried about anything felt anxious about something it's pretty common human emotion for us to be concerned about what's going on in the world and there's plenty to worry about. worry and anxiety they keep company with fear and distrust. We lack trust in God we lack trust in others. And that causes us to worry we feel afraid or nervous about the environment, and that produces anxiousness. And today we can hardly turn on the TV without seeing some event that's going on in the world that causes us to pause, to feel fear to feel some type of concern. Jesus addressed this in the Sermon on the Mount in Matthew chapter six, in verse 25, he said, Therefore, I tell you to not be anxious about your life, what you will eat, or what you will drink, nor about your body, what you will put on, Is not life more than food in the body more than clothing, Look at the birds of the air, They neither sow nor reap nor gather into barns, and yet your heavenly Father feeds them. Are you not of more value than they? Jesus looks to the world and he takes these creatures, these animals that are much less significant, then God's children. And he says, Look how I provide for them, I know their needs, I know the things that they have to have to survive. He goes on to say, in the Sermon on the Mount, that which of you by worrying can add a single hour to your span of life, worrying doesn't add life doesn't give you more years. In fact, doctors and health professionals will say that the exact opposite it can actually take away some of your health and your life.

Conrad Harkrider  21:33
Worrying is misguided focus, it's centering our attention on the wrong things. We put our our eyes on the problem on the issue, or the perceived issue, rather than on what's most important. When Jesus went into the house of Mary and Martha. Martha was busy making preparations, she was getting the food together. And she saw that her sister was not helping and that frustrated her she went to the Lord and brought it to his attention. And Jesus said to her, Martha, Martha, you are worried and bothered about so many things. But only one thing is necessary. Isn't that what anxiety is it's allowing our focus and our attention to be fixed on the things of the world. And when we do that anxiety and worry are not far behind. God knows the things that we need. And when Jesus was speaking to these people, they had far less in terms of fluency. There was no social security, there was no unemployment, there was no education assistance to be able to go and get a degree. And yet he says to them, don't worry about your life. Notice the extent of this in verse six, Ephesians, four, six are Philippians, four, six, Paul says Be anxious for nothing. What's not included in nothing? Nothing. This is comprehensive. It covers every aspect of our life. It's not just worry, don't worry about the small things. My shirt is wrinkled. My car is something's wrong with my car. But he's saying Don't worry about your appearance, your finances, your job, your health, your house, your children. It doesn't mean that we don't think about those things are have concern for them. But we don't allow that to turn into a negative unproductive fretting, that just causes us to spin around in circles. Notice what he says. But instead, we should pray. In everything, pray. Sometimes we think well, what what is it that we should ask God about only the big things, the spiritual things, the things that relate to my, my walk with God. But here Paul says that if you can be anxious about it, then you can pray about it. If it's weighing on your heart, then take it to the Lord. How often do we allow things to bounce around in our minds. And they bounce around up there for a while and then and then we bounce them around off of other people. And we tell them about it and we talk about it and then we think about it and we lose sleep over it. And we go days and weeks without ever taking it to the Lord. Whether it is small or great, Cast all of your cares upon Him because He cares for you. Paul uses a few different words here. He says that we shouldn't be anxious for nothing but in everything by prayer, that's a general term for approaching God's speaking to God. He says supplication that is making requests in treating God's favor asking for his blessings. And then he says Thanksgiving, a heart that is full of joy and appreciation for what the Lord has done expressing our gratitude, do our prayers when we come before God when we are bringing our anxieties and our worries and our concerns before him. Is our prayer also, coupled with thanksgiving? Do we focus only on the pain point and overlook the blessings? If you look around the world of what's going on right now, there are people that are fleeing their homes, getting into boats crossing the Mediterranean, there's a horrible famine that's going on in Yemen. Right now. The war in Syria has been raging for several years now. And there are Christians that are attacked in places like Egypt and throughout the Middle East.

Conrad Harkrider  26:27
We have so much to give thanks to God for we need to stop and consider I'm drinking clean water, I have a place to sleep. I have food on my table. I have health and people around me, brothers and sisters. And when we reflect on those blessings that should cause our hearts to be overflowing with thankfulness to the Lord. Did you see the promise that he made in verse seven? He says and the peace of God which surpasses all understanding will guard your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus. In verse nine, he says that at the end of verse nine, he says, The God of peace will be with you. So it is that the God of peace offers us he extends that peace to us. And He guards our hearts like a city with high walls around it, iron gates to protect it soldiers that are stationed along the border. So the peace of God can serve to protect our hearts, from the concern from the temptation from the arrows that Satan is launching towards us. The peace of God can guard our hearts. Finally, because we're in Christ, we must have a pure mind. Notice verse a Finally, brethren, whatever things are true, whatever things are noble, whatever things are, just what are the whatever things are pure and lovely, whatever things are of good report, if there's any virtue and anything praiseworthy, meditate, think about dwell on these things. In chapter three and verse 15, Paul says, Therefore, let us as many as our mature, have this mind. And if anything you think otherwise God will reveal even this to you. To be a child of God starts with our our hearts, our minds, our way of thinking. And if we're going to grow to maturity in Christ, we have to change the way that we see the world the way that we think about the world. What are we placing? What are we centering our thoughts and our minds on? There's a lot of benefits to technology, we have access to news and to entertainment and content, we can download movies and songs and watch clips of things that are happening all over the world. The YouTube app allows you to track the videos that you watch. If you go in there and you click on history. You can see all the things in the last 30 days or whatever that you've that you viewed. And I often think about if if someone came in and they opened up my account and they looked on recently watched what are the things that they would see there? Are they things that are true and noble? Are they commendable? Are they lovely? Are they worthy of praise? There's an idea in computer science called garbage in, garbage out. The idea is if you put bad data or information into a system or a process that what's going to be spit out of that process is bad data or bad output. And so it is with our minds if we are filling them up with things that are unholy, and ungodly, then how can we expect to be outflowing with praise and joy and thanksgiving? Our mind is a battleground. And Satan is looking for every opportunity that he can to stake His claim to set up shop in our minds and our hearts. And that's why it's so important for us. Paul says, Finally, at the conclusion of this, dwell on think about meditate, fill up our minds with things that are pure.

Conrad Harkrider  30:50
are we reading God's Word on a consistent basis? Are you listening to the Bible when you're in your car or traveling from place to place? Do we take advantage of this very unusual time that we live in where we can access sermons and Bible classes and and other lessons from brothers throughout the world at any point in time, I'm not saying that's a every minute of the day. But there should be balanced there should be some portion of our diet where we are feeding ourselves, dwelling on thinking about spiritual, spiritual things. Instead of allowing entertainment and sports and movies and shows to be all that we think about. But setting our mind on the things above. There's a song that has become more meaningful to me, as I've gotten older. And I think about the things that were once very important to me when I was growing up when I was in high school in college. It says, Turn your eyes upon Jesus, look full in his wonderful face. And the things of earth will grow strangely dim in the light of His glory, and grace. The more we fix our eyes, on the things above the lesson ambered we will be with the things of this world. Verse nine, he says, The things which you learned and received and heard and saw in me, these do, and the God of peace will be with you. It's not enough just to listen to the Word of God or to think about it, or to be around other people that are doing these things. But he says, what you have seen in me, you need to practice put it into your own life. That means that each one of us is striving for unity, we are rejoicing in the Lord. We take anxiety, and we turn that into prayer, a productive way to put our energy into bringing those things to God. And then focusing on having a pure mind. We're going to close with the invitation song this morning. If you're not a Christian, we urge you to become one. Submit your life to God put your faith in Jesus Christ and come and partake of a joy that can't be found anywhere else in this life. If there's something that we can do to encourage you in that path, please come down to the front as we stand and sing
