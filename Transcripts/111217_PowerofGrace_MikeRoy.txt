It's always so encouraging to me as we come together to worship our God to give him the praise that he richly deserves. This is the type of activity that is the most meaningful, that that we can engage in appreciate the songs very much that John left for us this morning, the prayers for the Lord's Supper, we are here to glorify God, there's a lot of subjects and issues that we need to talk about on a regular basis. We need to be balanced in preaching and teaching. And I trust that we are, in contrary to popular opinion, doctrine is actually very important. It's actually it's how we come to know God. But if all the teaching of all the doctrine that we may talk about in teach on, nothing is as important as understanding God's love, His mercy and His grace, certainly, we need to understand who he is and how we come to Him on the basis of our salvation with forgiveness and repentance and all of that. But understanding the character of God, his his mercy that is never ceasing His love, His grace, it is beyond our wildest imaginations. We need to understand that lesson, brethren that truth. And I believe that this truth that I'm talking about this morning, is as important a message as I will ever preach, or anyone will ever preach. That's how vital it is. God's grace is the platform. It is the foundation of our relationship with him and with each other. Yes, we reached out for God for God's lifeline. We crossed the bridge out of sin and into forgiveness and fellowship with Christ, we climbed into the ark of safety. But we didn't manufacture the lifeline. We didn't build the bridge from earth to heaven, and we didn't build the ark of safety. God did. And so our response is important to God, and in in securing that forgiveness, but our forgiveness and our hope of heaven is because of God's grace. Jesus is the lifeline. Jesus is the bridge between man and God. Jesus is Jesus's church as the Ark of safety. Did you notice the the first line actually in the last line of that song, but the first line that we sang just a moment ago, oh, the fount of every blessing, tune my heart to sing Thy grace, streams of Mercy never ceasing call for songs of loudest praise. I believe that the zeal and volume of our singing reflects the level of our gratitude for God's amazing grace. That's the only word to describe it. It's amazing. It's beyond description. And so this morning, I want to talk to you about

Mike Roy  02:44
the transforming power of God's grace, we'll be looking at a couple of different elements of God's grace. But that's the thrust of my lesson this morning, the trends I want us to understand the transforming power of God's grace. It's not a conventional lesson, I'm not conventional any longer been preaching so long, I'm just lawful convention. But and I say this, so this is not a conventional lesson. But neither is God's grace, conventional, it is extreme, its liberal is lavish. It endures forever. And my goal is for to help us understand to properly understand and fully trust the grace of God as Christians, like the statement from Heath Lambert, who wrote a book called finally free. He said, there is a danger that grace can become a topic we discuss rent rather than a power we experience. He wrote a book dealing with the struggle with sexual sin, in particular of the sin of pornography, how to overcome that. But the foundation of that book is based on God's grace, and that really the the foundation of overcoming all sin. All temptation is in fact, the grace of God. So this morning, let's talk about God's grace, it is transforming nature. And again, the whole idea is really to not just understand God's grace, but to trust it, and to believe it, and to experience that, that in some ways, it's like language that we don't normally talk about. But this is the foundation of our relationship with God, His mercy and His grace. So let's begin. Now I've got I think, most of the scriptures on the screen let's look at this passage in John chapter one, verses 14 through 17. I want you to notice that three times in four verses, grace and truth are emphasized as a fundamental quality of Jesus Christ. So John says in the Word became flesh and dwelt among us and we have seen his glory, glory as of the only Son from the Father. He said, full of grace and truth. John Boyle winced about him that his John the Baptist and cried out this was he of whom I said, He who comes after me ranks before me because he was before me Then verse 16, for free On His fullness, we have all received grace upon grace for the Lord, verse 17, was given through Moses, but grace and truth came through Jesus Christ. So the first glimpse that we see of Jesus Christ and the gospel of John reveals a lot of grace. He's full of grace, overflowing with grace, and truth. And then he notice over here, that John says that, from his fullness, we have all received grace upon grace. And so again, that's a way of saying that the grace of Christ is really beyond our comprehension. And the question is, who receives this grace, all of us, we have all received God's grace is sufficient for every single person, every single center. And so this is the message that John is sharing with us and sort of as he Behold the Lamb of God, this is what he sees, that the God of all grace was manifested through His Son, Jesus Christ. And again, in verse 17, we see the intentional contrast, Moses gave the Law. but grace and truth came through Jesus Christ, not to say that the that grace and truth were not found in the old law, but they are vastly superior in the life and teaching of Jesus Christ. So this is the platform Jesus comes into the world, manifesting the grace in the love of God, certainly we understand that we have to obey the gospel and turn from sin. But the foundation of our relationship with Him is grace. And sometimes I can think, well, I've obeyed the gospel, and I can quote some scripture. And I've taught so many people this wonderful, but I couldn't do anything. Without God's grace being shown to me or to each one of us. Let me share with you, again, this is we're focusing on around sort of a singular theme this morning, instead of having four or five points, but there are two aspects of God's grace I want us to think about for just a moment.

Mike Roy  07:08
The first one is forgiving grace. And then the other one is God's transforming grace. So we talked about forgiving grace, we understand that that what grace really brings to us is, it's a great gift of forgiveness from God, the washing away of our sin and his guilt, so forgiving grace. We all need it. We all rejoice in that it's powerful. We're so thankful for that. So one aspect of God's grace is forgiveness. When I sin, I can be forgiven. And when you sin, you can be forgiven. The second element of that I want us to think about, about God's grace is the transforming nature of grace what grace enables us to do so great transforming Grace provides this, the desire and the strength to change how we live our lives, we don't have to continue to live in sin any longer. That gives us the ability to overcome sin. It gives us the knowledge that when we do sin, we receive mercy from God and not judgment and condemnation. When we turn from our sense of grace, think about this. Try to convey some some principles here. Grace is power. Grace is strength. Grace enables us to live a different type of life. Yes, we have forgiveness. And we all need every time we stumble, every time I fail. I rejoice in God's forgiving grace. But the other aspect of grace, as it transforms as it changes who we are, it gives us the power to live with strength and determination. And Grace enables us think about this grace enables enables us to live a life of faith in obedience without worrying fear. Like, what if I fall? What if I stumble? What if I slip guess what you will and I do, but but through God's transforming grace, we can overcome our struggles. And so really, grace means that we're less anxious I think about our struggles, and ultimately, Grace, transforming Grace provides freedom, freedom from crippling fear and worry and doubt about sin. I came across this quotation years ago, I think you pronounce his name Reinhold Niebuhr. He was a turn of the century. Preacher, a theologian, a teacher at Union Theological Seminary and very influential around the turn of the century. He made this statement I write these things down in my journal, by the way, he said, All men who live with any degree of serenity, live by some assurance of grace, with true for everybody. If you want some peace of mind, you have to have grace. You have to have mercy and God gives it to us, both the forgiving side of his grace, but also the transforming The nature of his grace. So let's talk about as we go through the Scriptures, which I've put on the screen this morning, let's think about this trance, the transforming nature of God's grace. I'm going to jump in here in Romans chapter six. Paul is speaking here. In fact, I don't have the first couple of verses on the screen, I'm going to go ahead and read that and then jump to the scripture on the screen. But in Romans chapter six and verse one, Paul said, What shall we say then? Are we to continue in sin, so that grace may increase? May it never be? How shall we who died to stick sands still live in it? So we're saved by grace, abundant grace

Mike Roy  10:38
that God surrounds our lives with, but we don't abuse grace? Obviously, we don't continue in sin. So that is, the previous verse 21 said that grace would abound even more. So look at verse foot three, Paul said, Do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ and that's how you access his grace, baptism, faith, repentance? Do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death, we were buried therefore with him by baptism into death, in order that just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, we too might walk in newness of life. So there's the transforming power of grace. That is saying over here, in fact, I've got another translation, I want to look at very quickly, the end, I think, the NIV said, this way, that as Christ was raised from the dead to the glory of the Father, we too may live a new life, because of God's grace, in his transforming grace. We don't have to be in the grip of sin. And so think this passage is telling us that Jesus death, that we just thought about this in the Lord's Supper, Jesus death, becomes our death, in Jesus's resurrection is our resurrection. So Jesus death, death, and resurrection leads to our transformation. He died for sin, He died to sin, He died to overcome that for all of us. And this is what I'm calling the transforming power of grace. And so just as Jesus was raised from from death, raised from the dead, we too had been raised from spiritual death, that we live a new life, a holy life, yes, we still stumble. But this is what I call the transforming power of grace. And so as Jesus

Mike Roy  12:31
rose from death rose from the grave, we live a new life. That's what he's saying, over here. We too may live a new type of life. So that's what I'm calling the transforming power of great it changes who we are and how we live. Yes, we have forgiveness when we fail, but it empowers us to to change. And I've gotten a lot a lot of changes I need to continue to make we all do. But I think about from where I was in the Navy, as a sailor, and all the way I've lived my life, after worlds apart, and what brought that about was God's grace. I had to make decisions and walk away from a life of sin. But grace, God's transforming Grace changes us so that we will live a new life, a holy life a better life. We see this, I think, in several places in the scriptures. Look also with me, in Titus chapter two, verses 11 through 14. All right, the title says this, For the grace of God has appeared bringing self emphasizes here, For the grace of God has appeared bringing salvation for all people, training us to renounce ungodliness and worldly passions and to live self controlled, upright and godly lives in the present age. Waiting for our blessing hoped, the appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior, Jesus Christ, who gave Himself for us to redeem us from all lawlessness into pure purify for Himself, a people for His own possession who are zealous for good works. So you look at the language here. So he said, the grace of God, that's what's been emphasized the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation for everybody. Any person can be saved. It's amazing, isn't it? Any person, no matter how bad that person might be, can be saved because of God's grace. But what what God's grace does though, in verse 12, it trains us. The numeral via New International Version says this, it teaches us to say no to ungodliness and worldly passions. And so God's grace again, has a transforming element to it, and that it changes how we live and how we overcome the struggles and the temptations that we've we've faced and so I would say Brendan, let's put this truth into practice in our daily battles with him patient in say no to sin again. We also struggled, and I've failed in my life more times than I care to admit. But because of God's grace, I can overcome anything. You can overcome anything. Sometimes you don't believe that, but you can. And so what Paul is teaching in this, this epistle to Titus, is that when a bad thought comes into my mind, I just say, No, get out of my mind, Get behind Me, Satan be gone Satan. And if I'm watching something on television, and a bad image pops up, or I'm on my computer, and something pops up this ungodly, I say, No, that's not for me. This is not helpful, this will hurt me. So transforming Grace enables us to overcome sin. So yes, there's forgiveness, thankful to God that there's forgiveness for our sins. But what Paul's saying here, God's grace instructs us to say no to sin. And sometimes we have to just like turn off the television, or get out of the movie theater, or shut down the computer, or turn off your phone, because there's so many sources of evil, that infiltrate our minds. But the response is the same God's Grace says, to say no to that, unless it's a choice that we need to make. So again, just a reminder that as we talk about God's grace that we're focusing on, God's grace gives us forgiveness. But God's grace changes us, it transforms us, it empowers us. It equips us, it enables us. This is a life changing truth forever. And this, this can change your life, it continues to change me, and I've got a long way to go. But God's grace has the power to transform us. And we need to remember that we're we're Christians, we're, it's not like we're living out in the world and getting drunk and doing all the stuff that we shouldn't be doing those, those things can happen to any one of us. But we need to think about the fact that we belong to God. Look at what Paul says, in his epistle to the Romans, Romans chapter eight, and verses 14 through 17.

Mike Roy  17:10
So Paul says, For all who are led by the Spirit of God, are sons of God, but you did not receive a spirit of slavery to fall back into fear. But he said, You have received the Spirit of adoption as sons by whom we cry, Abba, Father, see the difference? We need to focus on the blessing of sonship. I'm not sure if that's grammatically correct, but it's true. We need to realize that we're sons and daughters of God Almighty. And because of that, as you said, in verse 15, because we're sons of God, we didn't receive a spirit of slavery, that's it overwhelm.

Unknown Speaker  17:48
What if I fail?

Mike Roy  17:50
What if I strip What if I fall again, he didn't give us a spirit of fear and slavery to fear where his sons, he gives us mercy, He gives us grace. You said, you've received the Spirit as of adoption as sons, by whom we cry, Abba, Father. And so what I'm saying is what God offers us when we slip and fall as Christians, is mercy and grace, not condemnation and fear. And God's safety net of grace allows us to hike up the challenging slopes of life with confidence. Yes, we hate sin. We detest it. We hate what it does to us and to God, how it hurts him. We confess it, we turn from it. But we don't hate ourselves.

Unknown Speaker  18:35
Because we've stumbled, right?

Mike Roy  18:39
But we do. I can't believe I did that, again. Can't believe allow those thoughts to come into my mind, anger, jealousy, hate, lust, whatever it may be. But as signs we don't fall back into fear, like, Oh, I'm ruined. My life is over. I can't go to heaven. That's what we think sometimes. Paul says that's not the case. And so we love ourselves. And we rest in God's mercy and grace, because that's who he is. You know, I remember a story that can leach told years ago when you're preaching out in Arizona, might have been Sun Valley. And this illustrates was in the minds of almost all of us, at least at different times, is a faith he preaching sermon. A faithful late, faithful Christian, probably 70 years old, comes forward at the invitation song just in tears. And excuse me, and she basically is saying, I'm just afraid. I'm afraid I haven't done enough good deed. I'm afraid I haven't taught enough people. That type of thing that we all think about. And I'm not sure exactly what can sit the hurt that time but he basically said You're right.

Unknown Speaker  19:51
You can't do enough. You can't teach

Mike Roy  19:55
enough people. That's not how you save your soul. But we're saved. On the basis of God's grace, isn't that true? But how many of us do the buggers do enough good deeds, if I can just dotted my T's and crossed my eyes? No, it's the other way around, right? thought my eyes and crossed my T, but we can't, you can't do it. I'm telling you, you can't do it. Even with spell checking everything else on your computer, you can't do it, you will make mistakes, and someone's gonna have to correct those, someone else is going to do that. So that's the point that I'm making here is that God's grace gives bridges the gap between our faith in our successes and our failures. And we need to understand that this principle is valuable, understanding that we're God's children. And because of that, we don't live a life of worry and fear how many Christians like that lady think we need to go forward because we've just not done enough good deeds can't be done. And that's, and that's what and that's what God's grace provides for us. Let me see if I can illustrate this in another way. And oftentimes, you know, we illustrate Bible truths with sports. I don't know why they did. But that's, that's how it is, right? We illustrate this principle. So think about this in terms of basketball, if some of us played basketball, and you have five guys on a team, or whatever the case might be, and just imagine in the game, and I like to shoot the three pointer, although I can't shoot it anymore. I used to do that in my younger days, but just think that my team is down by a couple points and the clocks running out. And I'm wide open. And you know, someone's kid would say, shoot it, just shoot it and get all the other guys under the basket. And so it's okay, and I shoot it. And it's an air ball. But what happens in somebody like Jacob jumps up, catches the ball midair, it puts it in and we win the game. So he was my grace. So because of grace, I can take the risk and shoot it. Sometimes I might mail it, not anymore. But if I miss, I've got teammates, who will be my safety net. God's grace is your safety net. You have to trust it. And yet, that's the we just don't do that. Think about it. In terms of parents, with your children, you're teaching them to ride a bike, you know. And so what do we do when our kids are small, we get behind on a hole onto the seat and Jesse's trying to peddle these unstable, and then when he falls, I go there, pick him up. How many of us when you're teaching your kids to ride a bike, and they fall, and they skinned their knee? You say oh, how house how uncoordinated can you be? I never fell off my bike.

Unknown Speaker  22:48
What?

Mike Roy  22:51
Are you gonna look with a condescending attitude and say, I can't believe you did that. Know what we do is we just bend down, we hug him and kiss him. We say we loved you moms can Mama's gonna make it better than that Mama's kiss always does make it better. Kick can be enough, you know, screaming and pain. But that's God's grace. When we fail. When we stumble, we fall. God bends down and shows us that remarkable grace. And so we need to and this this. This principle is so vital. I think we need to dwell on that some more. So again, thinking of turn think in terms of the fact that we are sons and daughters of God. He is not going to turn his back on you. When we sin. Yes, we may be rebuked, we need to repent of our sins. But once we've done bad, don't hold this guilt trip the rest of your life. I can't believe what I did 40 years ago, 20 years ago, and yet how many times do we think that? So Romans chapter eight is a powerful verse. Look at one of the verse with me, in James chapter four. And verses four through six. And James chapter four, verses four through six. James says you adulterous people do not know that friendship with the world is enmity with God. Therefore whoever wishes to be a friend of the world makes himself an enemy of God. What do you suppose that it is to no purpose that the scripture says He yearns jealously over the Spirit that He has made to dwell in us think about that. So in a world of sin, and even God's people may be giving into sin. And James is telling them not to do that. He said, Don't you understand that God yearns jealously over the spirit, that he is made to dwell in you or in us? And what does God do because of that? But he gives more grace. We give that to our children. We give that to our spouses. We give that to each other when we stumble. Why is it so hard to give it to ourselves? So that's the point of it. Making the endemic conclusion their universe six therefore it says God approved opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble. So the point I'm making here is that God has a vested interest in us. Just like Romans chapter eight, we are His children, sons and daughters, right? He redeemed this by the blood of His Son. He is not going to look for an opportunity to knock our heads off, and to be unkind to us. In fact, that says that He yearns jealously over the Spirit that He placed inside of us may not understand all of that, but I belong to God, you belong to God and His I allowed his word to inhabit my body, my mind, he is, quote, dwelling within me, when his word rules my heart, in my mind, and because of that, James says, He gives more grace. And, and think about this, sometimes we can see the power of a verse by see, looking at what it does not say, does it say in verse six that God is supposed to the proud, but gives judgment and punishment to the humble? Is that what that verse said? That God is opposed to the proud but gives judgment and punishment to the humble? No, it says, God is opposed to the proud but gives grace to the humble, we get to learn that lesson. And it's a powerful truth that we need to think about in our lives. Look at one of the verse with me, in Zephaniah, chapter three, this is, to me one of the very powerful bursts. This verse is describing God's the return of God's people from from sin from kept from captivity. They were living a horrible life of idolatry and adultery, you name it, every imaginable heinous sin possible. And now they've returned to God. What is God's attitude over these people? God says in verse 14, sing aloud, or daughter of Zion, shout, O Israel, rejoice and exalt with all your heart, oh, daughter of Jerusalem, the Lord has taken away the judgments against you. He has cleared away your enemies, the king of Israel, the Lord is in your midst, you shall never again fear evil. On that day, it shall be said to Jerusalem, fear not, oh, Zion, Let not your hands grow weak, the Lord your God is in your midst and mighty one who will save and look at the last three lines, he will rejoice over you with gladness, he will quiet you by his love. He will exalt over you with loud singing at this amazing, my god singing over me.

Mike Roy  27:55
It is it's just kind of hard to get our, our minds around that type of love. But that's, that's because of the God that we serve as a God of grace, a God of mercy. Yes, we want to do our best in learn his will, and be faithful to Him and overcome our struggle with sin. But at the end, when we put our trust in God, he rejoices over us. That line that says, I'll get it together in just a minute. He will quiet you by his love him. And how many of us need to be quieted by God's love. And so you look at this passage and is what God is saying to us. Today, as his sons and daughters, if we're if we've obeyed the gospel of Christ, that He rejoiced over us, He loves us, even to the point of singing over us with loud singing. It's just hard to imagine that level of love, so hope I want to leave that image with you. But I want to say as we wrap up the lesson this morning and extend the invitation, that God's grace is powerful. It's beyond our understanding. But we have to if we want to have forgiveness of our sins, we've got to respond to His grace. So I do want to stress that again. We raised the question how do you respond to God's grace? Well, you must believe that Jesus is the Messiah, you must repent of your sins. You must confess your faith in him. You must be baptized in water for the forgiveness of your sins. We say this often. And I trust it I'll say it to my breath is taken away from me. This is how your your you're saved from your sins. If you haven't obeyed the gospel of Christ this morning. That's what you got to do. God's grace is magnificent, but it is of no avail if you don't respond to it. When you respond to God's grace, you can't say I pull myself up by the bootstraps because you haven't. You've just responded to him as his ladder of mercy. But if you haven't done that, we are urge you to do that well if you just need the praise of his congregation whatever the needs might be this morning you might come on we're standing saying this invitation song
