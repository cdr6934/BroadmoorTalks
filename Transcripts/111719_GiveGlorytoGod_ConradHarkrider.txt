Have you ever have you ever stopped to think about what is the meaning of life? That's a pretty deep question. What is the purpose of living? Why are we here on this earth? What is it all

Conrad Harkrider  00:44
about? I was having a conversation with a friend one night, and I came back into the room and my wife asked me, she said, What were you talking about? We've been talking for some time. And so I told her who I was talking with. And she said, Well, what was the conversation about? And I said, m O l? And she said, what is m O l? And I said, That's meaning of life. And she paused for a second. And she said, What do sports have to do with the meaning of life? I said, Well, we talked about a lot of different things in the conversation. But mo L is now sort of our inside way of saying that I had a deep conversation with somebody, we had something that was really meaningful. It was we got past the surface level when we were having when we were talking. But if you ask people today, if if you just took a survey, what is the point of life? What types of things do you think people would say, the purpose of life is to be happy. The purpose of life or the goal of life is to travel to see the world to experience different things. The reason that we are here is to make a name for ourselves to be remembered so that people would know who we are, so that we would have some type of impact on the world. You know, to be honest, a lot of people live their lives as if the the sole purpose or goal is to make as much money as possible, to have a lot of nice stuff to gain status or power or position in the world. Or maybe we might say that the purpose of life is to serve other people to find a true love a real authentic love. Now some of those have true to them. But if you had to boil it down into one phrase, what would you say is the meaning of life in Romans 16, as Paul is concluding his letter to the Romans, he closes with a statement of praise to God, what we refer to as a duck's a doxology. And in this statement of praise, we see him give glory to God, He gives glory to God. And this is not just a nice thing to do when you're writing a letter as you're closing things down. But rather, what we see from Romans that this is the whole reason that why we're here. This is the purpose of why we exist, to give praise and glory to God. Read with me in Romans chapter 16, beginning of verse 25. It says, Now to Him who is able to strengthen you, according to my gospel, and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery that was kept secret for long ages, but has now been disclosed. And through the prophetic writings has been made known to all nations, according to the command of the eternal God to bring about the obedience of faith to the only wise God, the glory forevermore through Jesus Christ, amen. There are a few things that stand out in these verses. First of all, notice that from verse 25, to 27, there's only one period. This is all one sentence. And as Paul has a tendency to do, he will sort of start out with a thought. And then he gets sidetracked on a tangent, in this case, a very wonderful tangent as we'll look into some of the details here and just a bit, but then he picks back up with what he was saying Down in verse 27. Notice that he starts in verse 25, by saying, now to him, now to him and then it says if he picks back up in verse 27, he says, To to him, that is to the only wise God be glory. That's the central point of what he's saying here to him. Let's be glory. It's almost as if we could gray out the rest of that section there. And you can see what he's trying to say now to Him the glory with some amazing truths that are sandwiched in between. But another thing to note here is that there are a number of similarities between what Paul says at the conclusion of his letter to the Romans and chapter 16. And what he began saying to them in chapter one, when he opens the letter, and I placed these side by side, hopefully to emphasize this, and we'll just go through a few of these. But notice, in chapter one and verse one, he talks about how he has been set apart for the gospel of God. In chapter 16, in verse 25, he concludes by saying that God is able to strengthen you buy this gospel, so the focus of this message, this Gospel that Paul was bringing to them, and the effect that it could have on their lives. He also says that this in chapter one and verse two, he says that this was through his prophets in the Holy Scriptures. This is something that has been foretold in chapter 16. In verse 26, he again mentions that this has been disclosed. And through the prophetic writings, these things have been, they were written long ago, they were foretelling a time when God would draw all people to Himself. And then he says, in Verse five, he talks about how this is something that is going in chapter one, this is going to all the nations. And then in chapter 16, in verse 26, he again emphasizes that this has been made known to all the nations. And then finally, he uses this phrase, the exact phrase, in chapter one and verse five, he says, that this is being done to bring about the obedience of faith. And then he uses that phrase again, in chapter 16, and verse 26. He said that these things have been delivered forth to bring about the obedience of faith. These verses in chapter 16, are not just a section of praise, but rather they serve as a capstone. They are a way of Paul summarizing many of the truths that he is been going into in great detail in the book of Romans. And so let's look at some of these things a little deeper as we think about our purpose in all in giving glory to God, first of all, notice that we give glory to God because of what it says in verse 25. He says in verse 25, now to him, who is able to strengthen you. We see here that God, He provides strength to us, we give glory to God, because He provides strength. The first step in coming to God is to recognize who we are. It's to acknowledge where we are our current situation in Romans, Paul paints a very dark picture of the life that is without God before coming to Christ. What did things look like? In chapter one and verse 21, he says, talking about the Gentile world, for although they knew God, they did not honor Him as God or give thanks to Him. but they became futile in their thinking, and their foolish hearts were darkened. Notice some of the ways that he describes them. He says, it says if they they knew about God, but they didn't recognize him. They didn't honor him. He says they became feudal. He describes them as few as foolish. He says that their hearts were darkened. That's the picture of a life that is without God acting as if God doesn't exist. And that's a thing that's very common in our world today. People simply ignoring the fact that there is a God, there's a lot of pride and arrogance that goes along with that, because we think that we are self sufficient. We don't need God. We have everything. We can do it on our own. In Romans chapter five and verse six, he says, For a while we were still weak, at the right time, Christ died for the ungodly. Here he describes us as weak and ungodly. And that's what it is without God and Christ in our lives. It's not just doing things the way that we think they should be done or doing it our own way. But Paul says that that's weakness. We are weak, and that may seem a little strange to describe a person weak, someone who is they're healthy, They're young, they're intelligent, they're successful, maybe they're physically strong. But when you peel all of those things back, if you don't have Christ, it's weakness. In 2018, there was a pedestrian bridge down on the campus of Florida International University in Miami. And they were in the final stages of construction, about to put the bridge into service. And there was one afternoon, when there was some cars that were stopped at the light underneath the bridge. And suddenly the whole structure collapsed down onto the intersection. There were a dozen or so people that were injured, six people were killed. And you think about this enormous structure that's designed to last for decades, and now it's sitting crumbled on the street below. How does that happen? Well, as they went back and looked at

Conrad Harkrider  11:04
the records and what all had occurred, they realized that, although it appeared to be strong, visibly, there was cracks in the foundation. The concrete was starting to bend, it was starting to split. Even though it appeared that everything looked okay. There was problems in the foundation. Does that describe our life today? Is it starting to buckle? Is it starting to crack under the pressure of sin or temptation? Or are we are we starting to feel the effects of this world things like disappointment and failure and setback, or just the realization that nothing in this world is permanent, nothing lasts forever. Notice what Paul says here, we feel that weakness, we feel that need, we feel susceptible to the world. And Paul says that the Lord is able to strengthen. We see all those things, those problems, and we might go to education, or money or wealth or possessions or a relationship, and we look for fulfilment, and all these other places, when ultimately the one who is capable of helping us and providing strength is the Lord. In March chapter five, we're told about a woman who came to Jesus, and she had been suffering for a number of yours for over 12 years, she had this problem, his flow of blood. And Mark tells us that she had gone and sought out help from physicians and other experts. But instead of making the problem better, and it only gotten worse, she had spent her entire livelihood on this. One day, she came into the crowd where Jesus was, and she went up to him and she just touched the edge of his garment. And instantly, she was healed of her disease of her problem. She was looking for help from people who were incapable of helping her.

Conrad Harkrider  13:25
Instead of going to the one who has all power, she was looking in the wrong places. But that's what Paul is emphasizing here, God is able to provide strength. He's capable of healing us. And when we come to Christ, he can provide healing for our souls. He can give us strength so that we can face the daily challenges of this life. And notice how this happens. He says, notice the means by which this strength can come to us. He says in verse 25, he's able to strengthen you according to my gospel, and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery. He talks about three things here. He says the gospel, he says preaching, and then he says, Revelation, the preaching of Jesus Christ, the revelation of the mystery, all three of these are essentially talking about the same thing. They're referring to God's word. The gospel is the good news, the preaching of Jesus Christ, the preaching about His resurrection, and the revelation this is the the great mystery that God has revealed to the world, that he is now disclosing these things. In the first century, there were 1000s of people that became Christians. And you think about well, how did people go from living a life of sin or living in a worldly environment? How do they go from that to being followers of Christ? How'd they do it? It's the same way that it's done today. 2000 years later, the process is the exact same by hearing the Word of God, and then responding to it in faith. And when we do that, the Lord can provide strength. He restores us, he lifts us up, he heals our our spiritual diseases. And he provides us with purpose and direction, he is able to strengthen us, not just for a single day, not just for a few weeks or months or maybe a few years, but for the rest of our lives. God can inject he can provide that strength to our hearts. In Romans, chapter eight, verse 37. He says, No, in all these things, we are more than conquerors through Him, who loved us. You see, the assurance that Paul speaks with we are conquerors we can overcome whatever we face in this life because of the strength that God gives to us and that ultimately, causes us to give glory to God. Also notice we give glory to God, because he has made known his salvation. In verse 25. He says that this is according to the revelation of the mystery that was kept secrets, for long ages, verse 26, but now has been disclosed, and through the prophetic writings has been made known to all nations. This was a mystery, something that was kept secret throughout the ages. But now it has been disclosed. It was not known how God was going to fulfill his promises to Abraham, Isaac and Jacob.

Conrad Harkrider  16:52
The it was not understood how God was going to save the Gentiles what was going to happen to the Gentiles. Throughout the Old Testament, there's lots of promises about the nation's about the Gentiles, and call him Paul quotes, many of those here in Romans chapter 15, he gives for quotations all talking about the Gentiles, and how that one day they would rejoice that they would give glory to God, that they would sing his praises, and that they would put their trust in Him. These things were foretold by the prophets, but how is it all going to work out? How is God going to fulfill these things? Well, we see in Christ, that God both keeps his word, he keeps his promises to the children of Israel. And he extends salvation, and mercy and grace to the Gentiles. And if that weren't enough, he ultimately then brings these two groups together, both Jews and Gentiles, so that they would be one family in Christ. That's the mystery that is being revealed the salvation that's being made known to all people. Can you imagine if you went to Rome, before the time that the gospel went there, before Paul's written this letter, if you went to Rome, and you found a group of Jews, and they are going to synagogue, and they're dressing differently, and they're eating certain types of foods, and they're holding to their traditions, they're living a very different life from the Greek culture that they're in. And then you went and found a group of Gentile Romans. And they're engaging in idol worship, and they practice in morality, and there's ungodliness in their life. And if you went to those two groups, and you said, in a couple of years, you are not only going to come together as one group, you're going to eat together, you're going to have fellowship, you're going to have a relationship, you are going to love each other, like family. Now, what would they be thinking? If you said that? That sounds ridiculous, those two groups are miles apart. They're completely opposite. In so many ways. You can't force people to have fellowship with one another. How's it ever going to be possible for them to be spending all this time together, let alone treating each other like brothers and sisters, that would be impossible, we'd say, and yet in Christ, that is exactly what we see happen. These two opposing groups that were so different in many ways, they now come together as one body in Christ and we see the same thing happened today. People from all different backgrounds, people from all different walks of life, are now united in Christ together, many of us would have never had any Any type of association we may not have crossed paths in work or school or in community, but now to. But now in the body of Christ, we are one. That is the glorious plan of salvation that God has made known. And when we see that plan working, that God extends this favorite not just to a select few, but to all people, that all nations, all tongues, all races can come together, and be joined as one in Christ that that is a reason for giving glory and praise to God. We are no longer outsiders, and strangers. But as Romans chapter eight talks about, we've been adopted as children, we have this amazing blessing of being able to call God our Father, this intimate relationship that we have with him. And we are no longer slaves or servants in God's house, but rather children and heirs. God has written us into the wills, so to speak, so that now we are in line to receive this internal these this eternal inheritance that he is offered. Also notice we give glory to God.

Conrad Harkrider  21:15
Oh, Romans chapter 15, in verse five, talking about this unity that we find in the body of Christ, He says, May the God of endurance and encouragement, grant you to live in such harmony with one another, in accord with Christ Jesus, that together you may with one voice glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. These two different, these two different parties are now as one they're glorifying God together with one voice in Christ. Also, we see that we give glory to God because He calls us to obedience. In verse 26, he says that these things have been disclosed, they've been made known to all the nations, to bring about the obedience of faith, the Gospel, the preaching about Jesus Christ, this mystery that's been delivered, the message of salvation is ultimately intended to produce the obedience of faith. As we said earlier, this phrase is used at the beginning of Romans. And here at the end, it serves as bookends for Paul's message. And what's interesting is that Paul uses these two words, and he couples them together, faith and obedience. A lot of people come to the book of Romans, and they talk about faith. How if a person puts their faith and trust in God, then they will be saved. But Romans also emphasizes the response of the believer, what a person does when they are convicted, that Jesus is the Lord, and how they respond. And they're put in stirred into action. Obedience is more than just going through the, through the motions, it has to have faith behind it. And faith is more than just believing that God is true that God exists, there has to be a conviction, putting putting this in to action. Romans talks about God's mercy what God has done on our behalf, how God has forgiven us of our sins. The gospel is the good news that we can be released from sin. But the good news is only a message of hope to those who are willing to receive it, and not just receive it in the sense of being open minded towards it. But they would submit their hearts and their lives in obedience to the Lord. God is looking for those who will come to him. But not just come but then continue a lifelong relationship, that we would not just say one time that that we love God, that we trust in God, but yet that would be the beginning of a lifelong commitment, where we are continuing to grow stronger in our love and our service for him. In Romans chapter six, in verse 17, it says, But thanks be to God, that you who are one slaves of sin, have become obedient from the heart to the standard of teaching to which you are committed, and having been set free from sin, have become slaves of righteousness. He talks about our former life, how we were slaves, we were enslaved to sin, but now we've become obedient. Where does that obedience come from? Not just an external, doing things on the outside, but he says it is obedience from the heart. And notice how we're guided how we know what it is we're supposed to be doing, he says the standard of teaching. And then there is a level of commitment, the standard of teaching to which you are committed. When I was in middle school, I went out for the seventh grade football team. And I went to a big school, there was over 100 kids that wanted to be on the team. It was as if anyone who had ever played football, thought about football, watched football, decided that they wanted to come and be on the team. And the school had a problem because there wasn't enough uniforms and helmets and equipment for all of these kids. And so the coaches came up with this amazing plan. For the first two weeks of the season, the only thing that we did was conditioning, they were conditioning us to quit the team, they were trying to weed people out, get the numbers down. And so all of a sudden, the people who said that they like football, the people who said that,

Conrad Harkrider  26:08
that they enjoy playing football, saying those things, and then actually being on the team. Now those were two very different things. Because there's a tremendous amount of work that was required. There was this effort that had to be put for the sacrifice that was involved. Now all of a sudden, there was a bunch of kids that decided that they could find something better to do with their time. When Jesus called people to follow him. He wasn't just looking for people to say nice things about him. He called them to leave their occupation, their family, their homes, and to put their trust entirely in him. Not just for a couple of days, or a few weeks, but for the rest of their lives. This was a life long commitment to completely change their course, obedience. And its very essence is showing our commitment to God. It's staying devoted and faithful to the Lord. We're serving the Lord. Because not just because he's a good, good teacher, because he has some helpful things to say. But his position is that of the king. He is the Lord. He is the master of our lives. And so we submit to Him, we follow His word, not just out of fear or out of thinking that there's going to be some negative consequence, but because of our love and our trust for him, and when we have that type of dedication and commitment to God, that ultimately brings glory to his name. Finally, notice, verse 27. It says to the only wise God be glory forevermore through Jesus Christ, amen. We see from this text that God deserves all glory. He says, He alone is wise and worthy of praise and worship, both now in the present and then throughout eternity. That's what we'll do for ages when we are with Him in glory. Let's think about God's glory. For just a few more moments from the book of Romans in Romans chapter three. In verse 23, it says, For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God. When we sin, when we give in to desire and lust and temptation, we are falling short of God's glory, the standard he is perfectly pure and loving and kind and just, and he sets that, that standard for us. In Romans chapter nine, verse 23, it says, in order to make known the riches of his glory for vessels of mercy, which he has prepared beforehand, for glory, when God extended salvation to the world, he was making known the riches of his glory. He also says at the end of this verse, that we're prepared for glory, we will share in that same glory if we are faithful to him. And then in Romans chapter 15. In verse seven, he says, Therefore welcome one another, as Christ has welcomed you, for the glory of God, when we welcome one another, in a very practical sense, when we work together, when we accept one another, it is to the glory of God. How do we think about well, how do we give glory to God? Is that just, of course, it's in our words, the things that we say, but it's also in our actions. And here he's talking about our relationships with one another The way that we treat our brothers and sisters in Christ. And so when a when a family who has young kids reaches out to an older couple, who's different different life stage, different situation, different interests and things going on. But when those two connect, that's done to the glory of God, when a young person connects with a, an older widow, and they're reaching out, and they're building that relationship, and that community that's done to the glory of God, that's not something that always comes naturally for us. But what God is saying what Christ desires is that all of the members would be united would be joined together. And when we do that, when we welcome one another, it brings glory and honor to the Lord. Think about your situation that you're in right now. You're a young family,

Conrad Harkrider  31:06
you've got little kids, you're not always going to be in that demographic. And thinking about connecting with other people outside of our group of friends, our peers, the people that are like us, at some point, God willing, you're going to be an older couple, or you might find yourself being a single, or whatever it may be. But how do you want to be treated in those same situations, or if one of your children grows up and they go to a congregation where they may be the only person or the array, a young adult? How do we want them to be treated in those situations? When we make an effort to reach out when we're joined together that ultimately brings this glory to God. In Romans chapter eight, in verse 18, he says, For I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worth comparing with the glory that is to be revealed to us. Ultimately, our life is to be lived in, in service and giving praise to God, we offer glory to Him. But the promise that God has extended to all his people is that one day that glory will be transferred to us that we will be raised up to live with Him in glory. If you're not a Christian this morning, we want to encourage you to think about your relationship with God and we stand ready to speak with you to talk to study, whatever it may be, but this is a perfect opportunity to make your life right to commit your life to God and begin that walk. If there's something that we can do to encourage you in your relationship with the Lord. Please come down to the front as we stand and see
