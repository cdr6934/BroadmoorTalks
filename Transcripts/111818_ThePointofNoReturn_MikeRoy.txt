It is always such a pleasure to come and worship are great and awesome God to give him the praise that is rightly do his name. And that's what we are doing here this morning. Appreciate those songs very much that John picked out for this lesson. And I have a message I want to share with you this morning that I hope will be might even be a life changing message. If you traveled to the upper river above the above Niagara Falls, there are two signs I'm told that you will see there about 3.2 miles from the falls, there is a sign that says danger zone in boaters need to be aware that if they cross into that zone, if their boat loses power, there may be no escape from going over the falls. There is another sign that's very close to the falls, which reads the point of no return. And the warning is obvious. Any boater who comes into that water above the falls, who gets too close to the falls, even with a high powered engine, may be unable to escape the force of the current and be thrown over the falls to their death below. Can you imagine being on that river. And seeing that sign that says the point of no return? It would be terrifying to see that. The first eight verses of Hebrews chapter six contains precisely the same spiritual message and warning for all Christians. God is telling us in this passage that we'll be looking at this morning to stay out of the danger zone to stay away from the point of no return. Once we enter that zone, whether it's through curiosity, or carelessness or willfulness, it may be impossible to come back to God's safety net of grace and mercy. And so if you've got your Bibles open, I'm gonna have the scriptures on the screen. I want for us to be aware of the warning that God has given to every Christians here, that he is warning us to stay out of the danger zone of sin. And if we get too close to this world, too close to sin, and too close to false teaching, we may reach a point where we are unable to return to God. And so my lesson this morning is called the point of no return as talking to Jesse and even Jim this morning. And through my years of preaching and teaching God's word I haven't really talked about this, perhaps like I should, and maybe it was this time, as I was looking at Hebrews chapter six, it really got my attention. But I want us to think about this to Texas, Hebrews chapter six, verses four through six, I will have these verses on the screen, but conveys a compelling message for us to be thinking about. Because this is a message that we very often don't think about. Because we often feel that we can always at any point in our lives, come back to God. So we'll talk about that as we get into the lesson. But I want you to notice this text this morning in verses four through six, and then we'll we're gonna go through this text basically just stay here and discuss the look at what the writer is saying in this chapter.

Mike Roy  03:16
In verse six, he says for is impossible, in the case of those who have once been enlightened, who have tasted the heavenly gift, and have shared in the Holy Spirit, and have tasted the goodness of the Word of God and the powers of the age to come, and then have fallen away, to restore them again to repentance, since they are crucifying once again, the Son of God to their own harm, and holding him up to contempt. That's the ESV version wants you to focus on his phrase here I've highlighted for it is impossible to restore them again to repentance. That's the verse that best is the statement I want us to focus on this morning. So we'll be looking at this text we're gonna go back and look at the the earlier context and some verses that follow follow that. But the phrase that I want to burn in your mind, in my mind is this statement. The writer saying is impossible. If you take out this parenthetical statement, it is impossible to restore them again to repentance. Well, let's by way of overview, this what we want to talk about this morning, the first three verses, we see the need to leave the elementary doctrines and press on to maturity. In verses four and five, I want to make the point emphatically that these people are clearly Christians in this context. And verse six, we'll see several key phrases verse six, but we'll discuss the fatal fall the phrase that these Christians had fallen away. I want to talk about that. What does that mean? In verse six is also a phrase it's impossible to renew them to repentance. We talked about that just a moment ago. And then verse six, the another big question is why? Why is it impossible to renew these people to repentance? Well, the answer is because they crucify Christ again. And then verses seven and eight of this text gives us the illustration of the cursed ground. And so again, that's reinforcing the message that the Hebrew writers is giving to God, I believe these Jewish Christian. So let's, let's talk about the context over here. And so in the first three verses, leading up to the statement that I read is the text of my lesson, the writer said this, let us therefore let us leave the elementary doctrine of Christ, and go on to maturity, not laying again, a foundation of repentance from dead works and of faith toward God, and of instruction about washings, the laying on of hands, the resurrection of the dead, and eternal judgment in this we will do if God permits. So in this, this section here, the course the word, therefore, is a connecting word, going to the previous chapter, so warning that Christians need not to be stagnant in their faith or go back in their faith and give up their faith. But the pressed on to the maturity, that we leave the the basic elements of, perhaps the gospel, there's a lot that can be discussed here. And go on to maturity, there's a picture of the builder who lays a foundation. And after the builder lays the foundation, he doesn't go back and lay the foundation again. And again, once you lay the foundation, you build the building. And that's what he's saying here. Once you lay the foundation, you move on from that. And you you build that that structure. And so he talks about not laying you get a foundation of repentance from dead works, perhaps he's talking about the Old Testament law, and the works of the law, which can never impart life, instructions of about washings. Some translations put the word baptism in there, not sure if that's what it was saying it may be in connection in the Jewish culture. of the Old Testament, there were many different types of washings, related to animals, even laying their hands on these animals. He talks about the resurrection of the dead. And the point that I'm making here is from the first few verses is that the writer is telling Christians that we need to lay aside the foundational principles, and we have to build our lives. And we have to grow spiritually, to become the kind of person that God wants us to be, so that we will not be overwhelmed by sin or brought back into sin. So that's the context over here. So this is a text that we were looking at, where the writer says it's impossible. He's talking about those who have once been enlightened, who have tasted the heavenly gift they've shared in the Holy Spirit, they've tasted the goodness of the Word of God and the powers of the age to come. Let's talk about that for just for just a moment over here. And the point I'm making is that these people that the writer is talking about are clearly Christians. So again, they've they've been enlightened, they've they've come to know God's will. They have tasted the heavenly gift. they've tasted salvation, they've tasted forgiveness. they've tasted God's mercy, they've experienced redemption. They've shared in the Holy Spirit, the Holy Spirit is promised to those who believe will obey the gospel. So they're partakers of the Holy Spirit. They tasted the goodness of God's word. They tasted the goodness of the coming age, they had the hope. These were Christians, they had the hope of eternal life, there had their hearts on fire for God, they're excited about that. And the point that I'm making here is that these people are clearly Christians. And the reason I stressed that is that many religious leaders, in fact, most of the commentators that I consulted, even in doing this lesson this morning denied this truth. They're saying that these people had never been saved. And that's why they are they're falling in, they're going back into sin they were never saved to begin with. But this is not true. The Scripture is telling us here that these people that their Hebrew writer is describing or could be describing are those who are Christians. They have escaped the world. Peter uses language that is similar to this. He says, For if after they have escaped the defilements of the world through the knowledge of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ, they are again entangled in them and overcome. The last date has become worse for them than the first for it would have been better for them never to have known the way of righteousness. Then after knowing it to turn back from the holy commandment delivered to them, but the true proverb says has happened to them, the dog returns to its own vomit in the sow, after washing herself returns to wallow in the mire. Peters talking about Christians who escaped the world to the knowledge of God's Will they obeyed the gospel of God. eyes, they were born again, they had the hope of eternal glory. And then they turn back away from God. Now they're like that pig went back in that mud pile puddle. And he's covered over with a sense all over again. So that's what the writer of Hebrews is telling us, that, that these people that are described in, in verse, verses four and five are clearly Christians. That's the warning. It's not for people who have never been saved. It is for Christians. So if you go look at this text, again, this is we're just going to stay in this text this morning. The writer said, this is impossible, in the case of those who have once been enlightened and tasted the heavenly gift and shared in the Holy Spirit, have tasted the goodness of the Word of God in the powers of the age of calm. And here's the critical statement, and then have fallen away. Let's talk about that. What is he saying over here, this is what I'm calling the fatal flaw, the fatal fall that pushes that pushes these people to the point of no return. I do want to mention that what's happening here is not just a slip or a stumble that we all that that happens to all of us in our life, from time to time, we all slip, we stumble, we fall. That's not what he's talking about. He's talking about a willful, decisive decision to turn there for these Christians to turn their back on God, and to go back into the world. And so it's a deliberate turning away from God, His Word, His kingdom and His people. It's a renouncing of their faith, I want to make that distinction, because otherwise we would be almost filled with terror. Every time I stumbled and slip, am I going to lose my salvation. That's not what he's saying here. But the phrase is that these people have experienced God's grace, they've been enlightened, they've they're partaking in the Holy Spirit, and then they have fallen away. So these are Christians make this very clear this morning. These are Christians who have apostatize from their faith, and they have gone back into Judaism or worldliness or a life of sin. I want to make that point very clearly. So again, understand that this phrase have fallen away is not a slip. It's not a stumble, it's not a failure that we all can engage in from time to time, this Greek word. Para Pepto, I'm told, is occurs nowhere else in the New Testament, except right here. So the point I'm making here, this is a decisive, meditated, turning away from God. And I stress that because many denominational preachers and teachers deny that this falling away could ever take place for a true believer they believed as most people do. Again, I was amazed when I was scanning the commentaries yesterday and today, how widespread this belief is that once a person is saved, they are always saved. And I just want to tell each of us, brethren, and friends, this is a dangerous and deceptive false teaching. It is not true. It is not true. In preachers and pastors all over this country or shouting that message, it is not true. And yet, every time you turn the page and a commentator, a commentary, they're saying, Oh, it's not possible to lose your salvation. That's the point of this text. Be careful that you don't go so far as to lose your faith and lose your salvation army. The point I would say also, is that there is plenty of security for a faithful believer, but God makes it very plain that a Christian can fall away from his or her faith and lose their soul. And that, again, is the very point of this discussion. So we're looking at some key phrases here. As we try to understand this phrase, ultimately, that we're kind of building this lesson around, it is impossible to renew it, restore them again to repentance.

Mike Roy  14:07
Why is that? What's going on over here? And so when we look over here, see if I've got that highlighted yet. So again, that's the phrase that we're focusing on. The writer says it is impossible to renew them to repentance. And again, this is very strong language. He didn't say it will be difficult to restore them. It will be hard to renew them. He said it is impossible. This is shocking language. God is trying to get our attention. And the question is, what does this mean? What does it mean it is impossible. It is impossible to restore them to repentance, very, very strong language. Several commentators suggest that it would be what he means by that it would be impossible But for any would be restore for you or me to go reach a fallen Christian and bring them back. We couldn't bring them back but they could come back by themselves. Or they're saying that God could bring them back or they made like the the, the prodigal son, Luke 15 come to their senses. Lots of there's lots of different views on this over here. Again, when I think of a statement that Kaufman says in his commentary, he compares the this type of sin this impossible return to repentance to the eternal sin of Mark chapter three, verse 28, Mark chapter three, verse 28, simply said, When Jesus speaking to the crowd there, he said, Truly, truly, I say to all sins shall be forgiven to sons of men, and whatever blasphemy they utter, and whatever blasphemy they utter, whoever blaspheme against the Holy Spirit never has forgiveness, but as guilty of an eternal sense. So the point I would make is we talk about this impossibility of repentance. He is I think, the writer is talking about a deliberate, willful sin, a premeditated sin, a willful turning away from God, not just any casual sin that we might be guilty of from time to time. Other passages in this book of Hebrews, I think, shed some light on this. And Hebrews chapter 10, the writer says, but we go on sinning deliberately, after receiving the knowledge of truth and listen, clamp plainly to what this passage is saying. If we go on sinning deliberately after receiving the knowledge of truth, there no longer remains a sacrifice for sins, but a fearful expectation of judgment, and a fury of fire that will consume the adversaries. The writer of Hebrews is saying in the same book that we're looking at, that those who sin willfully and decisively turn their backs on God, have no more sacrifice that can forgive them of their sins can't be done. You look at Hebrews chapter three of the passage, a few chapters early than chapter six, the writer says, take care, brethren, that there not being any of you an evil, unbelieving heart that falls away from the living God, but encourage one another day after day, as long as it is still called today, so that none of you will be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin. This is the danger, the danger is willful sin. And we have to be very careful that we don't be that we don't allow ourselves to be deceived by the devil and the lies that he dangles before us with some type of frequency. And so the writer is telling us here in chapter three, that we need to be on our guard, that we don't allow an evil, an unbelieving heart to develop within us, that will cause us to be to reach this point of hard heartedness. So when we're looking at the phrase, it is impossible to renew them through repentance, we've got to digest what he's talking about here. I want to I want to challenge maybe some long held thoughts that we have, we oftentimes say that anybody can be saved from their sins, if at any point in their life, Christian or non Christian, no matter how bad they are, how far we fall in, anybody can be saved at any point in life. And we even say that even any Christian who has fallen away, can always come back to God in His Church at any point in time.

Mike Roy  18:45
And the point is, I disagree with that. This passage is saying there comes a point where it's impossible for that person to come back to God. It's not that God couldn't reach them. But they've gone so far in the wrong direction, that they it's just like the boat or on Niagara Falls above that river and that river, you get closer and closer and closer to that falls, you may want to come back and you may try to come back, you need to hit that throttle full force, but you can't come back is too late. And that's the power of this passage. It's impossible to renew them to repentance. We'll talk about the phrase that follows that but we see this illustration and a lot of different ways to swimmer who goes to the ocean but a lot of us like to do that. And sometimes we're amazed by the powerful tide and the current all that kind of stuff and jump in the water. And we even if we're a strong swimmer, what can sometimes happen with rip tide and the strong Undertows and currents a person is pulled out to see you even though they want to come back and they try to come back. They have simply gotten in over their head and they can't come back. That's a message and that's why We have to be regular and our attendance and our worship to God and studying his Word because we don't want to get to that point where sin will drag us so far out to see that we cannot come back back in World War Two, the bombers would sometimes leave England is Big B seven teams or whatever they might have been. But they understood that they hit a flying range of maybe 3000 4000 miles. And as they were heading towards their target, if they went 1500 miles and they can have they have a 3000 mile range, they knew that they better hit their target and come back if they if they kept flying, and went past the halfway fuel mark on their tank, they realize they're not going to make it back to the base. So there is a point of no return. We don't talk about that. But we need to so what I want to suggest, as we look at this Texas morning, brethren, we need to change our language and say this, that any sinful person in any fallen Christian can come back to God, as long as they haven't reached a point of no return. Because if we raise the point of no return, then there's no way to get back to God's grace and God's mercy. And that's a message that we have to see. And that's why the language is so strong here in Scripture and getting the message for us is for this is, this is for all of us. But this is this is for all of us who are Christians. And the message is that we need to stay away from sin. We need to be on our guard against sin, we need to move against sin with a holy passion and a fear of God. And when sin starts to take a hold in my heart, we need to ask for help. That's why we have the Fight Club and different things like that. And Bible studies. When sin starts to take a hold of your heart, you better stop it. Because if you if you don't, it may overwhelm you or me. And we may get to that point where we've just gone too far in the wrong direction. So this is a text that we don't look at it very often, but we'd need to consider that. So again, the point we want to get back to this context. Back in Hebrews chapter six again, we're saying it's impossible to renew them to repentance again, the question is why? Why is it impossible? And I'm being deliberate in the lesson this point? Why is it impossible? Not difficult or hard to do? Why is it impossible? Well, the text tells us since they are crucifying once again, the Son of God to their own harm, and holding him up to contempt appreciate the song that John led for us this morning, the New American Standard versus sense they again crucify the Son of God, and put him to open shame. The ESP says since they are crucifying once again, the Son of God, to their own harm and holding them up to contempt. And so we're talking in this passage in Hebrews chapter six about Christians who have fallen away from the faith, they have deliberately walked away from God. So now that the writer is telling us the reason that it's impossible to restore them to repentance is because they are now like those who are outside the church like the enemies who crucified Christ. They are crucifying him all over again. And so what's happening to these Christians that he's talking about could happen is that with their sinful rebellion, they are driving the nails deeper into the flesh of Christ. They were once washed in the blood of Christ.

Mike Roy  23:41
But surprisingly, they are now bloodthirsty murderers. They are with those at the Cross who are shouting, Crucify, crucify Him. You know, we sang those songs this morning that is so powerful to me. About what what God has done for us, Shall I crucify my savior? Can we can we put him back on the cross? But that's exactly what happens. And that's what this director is saying over here. In the context goes on to say it, holding him up holding Christ up to contempt. So these Christians who have fallen away, this is not just a stumble or a slip, these Christians have fallen away. And now they are publicly and openly showing contempt for their Savior. They are holding him up to open shame by turning their backs openly on him. And this is why it is impossible to renew them through repentance in this context. I know that's shocking language. It's hard to get my arms around that because I understand we think at any point, at any point in time, anybody can come back to God. No, it's not true. We can go so far in the wrong direction, that there is simply no coming back to God. And that's what this passage is telling us over here. So Hebrews chapter six, as I looked at this, in preparation for this lesson really got got my attention. So again, just a reminder, that if we fall away from the faith and from God's people from his church from from his word, and do the things that this phrase is describing, then we put ourselves in company with the very people who crucified Jesus Christ. Can't imagine that and that's why that song is the words to the song that way Shall I crucify my savior? Well, there's one other. Actually, let me look at this verse. Before we look at the last section over here we are the length of verses 26 and 27. And then in verse 28, anyone who has set aside the law of Moses dies without mercy and the evidence of two or three witnesses, how much worse punishment do you think will be deserved? By the one who has trampled underfoot the Son of God, and has profane the blood of the covenant by which he was sanctified, and as outraged the spirit of great outrage, the Spirit of grace, for we know him who said, VENGEANCE IS MINE, I WILL REPAY. And again, the Lord will judge his people, it is a fearful thing or terrifying thing to fall into the hands of living God. So this passage over here gives a commentary on chapter six that we're talking about over here. So what happens when a Christian falls away, I'm not talking about the slip again, just want to make sure we're clear about that. What happens when we decisively apostatize from the faith and turn our backs on God and say, I'm going back into the world back into a life of sin and whatever it might be. What we're doing over here is we are trampling under foot, the Son of God, we are crushing him with our feet. And we are profaning the blood of the covenant, counting that as water is nothing the blood by which we're sanctified. And we are outraging the spirit of grace outraging God's grace and spirit compelling message over here that we need to be be thinking about. That's why it's in Scripture. God doesn't want us to get to the point of no return. But it's certainly possible for us for for that to happen to us. The last section in this Texas morning is in verses seven and eighth. So the writer says this following this very strong language for the land that has drunk the rain that often falls on it, and it produces the crop useful to those who for whose sake it is cultivated, receives a plant blessing from God.

Mike Roy  27:57
But if it bears, bears, thorns and thistles it is worthless and nearer to being cursed, and is and is to be burned. So it's an illustration of agriculture or farming and gardening. When the ground around us receives the sunshine of the rain from God and it yields a fruitful harvest. God blesses the ground, he blesses the trees, and the farm and all of that. But if the ground receives all this goodness from God, the rain and the sunshine, but it yields thorns and thistles. In essence, he said, God curses, the ground is going to be burned up. It's a serious warning for those of us who are Christians, not to deliberately turn our backs on God. What happens over here in this text is a failure in our stewardship, we've been talking about that this year. As stewards of God, we are to use the gifts that God has given to us. And if as Christians, we don't produce the fruit in our lives that God wants us to produce. Then the warning is for us. When Jesus was warning the Pharisees and the Sadducees. And Matthew chapter three is actually John was saying this. John the Baptist is talking to the Jewish leaders. He said, I baptize you with water for repentance. But he who was coming after me is mightier than I whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He will baptize you the Holy Spirit and fire His winnowing fork is in His hand, and he will clear His threshing floor and gather His wheat into the barn. but the chaff he will burn with unquenchable fire. Again, very strong language over here, and in Matthew chapter three, which coincides with this message from Hebrews chapter six. And so as we looked at this passage this morning, I think we need to understand that God's mercy in his greater infinite and God loves all people wants all people to come to repentance to a knowledge of the truth, but we need them To stand, that there is a point of no return, which if we crossed that point, in spite of God's infinite love, and in spite of the power of the gospel and the blood of Christ, it may be impossible to access that. And so as you continue to read in Hebrews chapter six, the writer says he is confident of better things for his brethren, I'm certainly confident for us today that we will not allow ourselves to reach that point of no return. But if we come too close to this lesson this morning, we extend the invitation to anybody who needs to obey the gospel of Christ. If you have not obeyed God's will, in terms of being born again, through faith in Christ, repentance, confessing the faith, and then submitting to God's command to be immersed in water, you have to do that if you want to go to heaven. We also extend the invitation for any Christian who feels like he might be slipping back into sin maybe slipping. To that point of no return. I felt like I have to ask the question this morning in view of this lesson. Is there anybody here this morning who feels like that maybe you're reaching the point of no return? That you hear the message, your worship God, but if God had been going in the wrong direction for so long, that maybe you don't feel like there's any hope? We're here to help any and all serve God faithfully overcome the sin that we all have to battle in our lives? We trust that no one is at that point, but if there's a need here that serious, we would invite you to come forward while we stand and sing this invitation song
