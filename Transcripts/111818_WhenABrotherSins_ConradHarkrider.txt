If you have your Bibles and want to be turning to Matthew chapter 18.

We have quite a few visitors with us tonight, we're glad that you're here. A lot of people are traveling, getting ready for the upcoming holiday. Some of our visitors are very close to me, my older brother and sister in law are here with us. We're taking up a whole row for the horse riders tonight. But my sister in law is actually the daughter of Jim and Carrie Hawkins. So they have extra reasons to come and visit this area. But my brother and I, my older brother and I, we go way back, we've known each other our whole lives. And growing up, how do I put this nicely. We didn't always get along. And I remember something that used to occur fairly regularly was I would have some type of leftovers, a slice of pizza, a cupcake, whatever. And I would take it and put it in the refrigerator. And when I would come back down the next morning or whenever to get my food, I'd open it up. And there would be a it wouldn't be gone. But there would be this giant one bite taken right out of the middle of whatever it was. And at that point, I would know exactly who was the culprit. And I would go to my brother, I'd say, Why did you do that? He makes some snarky remark like why didn't see your name on it or something like that. But it was so frustrating. When Jessica and I first got married, we were still while I was still in school, and we didn't have a lot of money at the time. And my older brother happened to own a house in the same city where we lived. And he was in a job where he would travel about half of the month he was there for two weeks and then gone for two weeks. And we were trying to figure out where we're going to live in our situation. He said, Well, why don't you just stay in my house? You know, I'm only there part of the time. And I think we can make it work. And so that's what we did. I think he charged us. I think we paid the electric bill and the water and then he covered everything else. And so I'd say he made up for all those bytes of food that he took over the years. I know it's sometimes hard on families that have multiple kids try to juggle personalities and sibling rivalry, rivalry and trying to keep the peace among the brothers or sisters. But I am especially grateful and blessed to have brothers. And tonight I want to talk about brothers but not within the immediate family relationship. But brothers and sisters as it relates in the body of Christ. And I want to look at this passage from Matthew chapter 15. And this appreciate Mike's lesson this morning talking about getting to the point of no return. And I think although this Mike and I didn't plan this, but I think this lesson fits in well with what we talked about this morning, because this is what's happening before that point or what should be happening before. These are the steps that should be occurring before a person reaches a point of no return. So read with me about when a brother sins, Matthew chapter 18, beginning of verse 15. It says, Moreover, if your brother sins against you go and tell him his fault between you and him alone. If he hears you, you have gained your brother. But if he will not hear take with you one or two more, that by the mouth of two or three witnesses, every word may be established. And if he refuses to hear them, tell it to the church. But if you're if he refuses even to hear the church, let him be to you like a heathen and a tax collector. Assuredly I say to you, whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven. Again, I say to you that if two of you agree on earth concerning anything that they ask it will be done for them by my Father in heaven, For where two or three We are gathered together in my name, I am there in there in the midst of them.

This section of teaching that we just read sits between two parables. In Matthew at 18. Right before this, Jesus describes a shepherd who has a flock of sheep. And he says that one of the sheep goes off and is, has gone astray. And the shepherd leaves the 90 and nine and goes to pursue the one it's a picture of how God feels about those who are lost. In verses 21 through 25, Jesus, following the section we just read, Jesus responds to a question that's asked of him, How many times should I forgive my brother, up to seven times, and Jesus says, No, seven times 70. And then he goes on to tell a parable about a man who owed an enormous amount of money 10,000 talents. After being released from his debt, he goes out and finds one of his fellow servants, and demands that he pay back a sum that is far less than what he was just forgiving of. Here, Jesus emphasizes the importance of offering mercy and forgiveness to our brothers. So it's important to remember the context of of what Jesus says here what follows before and right after, as we think about the process and the steps that are laid out here in verses 15 through 17. First of all, notice verse 15, if your brother sins against you hear the the references to a brother, this is referring to a spiritual brother or sister, someone who's in the body of Christ, we call them brothers, because not because that's just a cool thing to say, or because it's habit or it just sounds good. But rather it is a term that signal signifies that special relationship that exists among God's people we are, we are family, we have been born into the same faith. This implies closeness there are feelings of, of love and concern and protection, the same things that should exist within an earthly family. There is a special bond there between brothers. Does that describe how we feel about the people at this church? Do we see them as family as brothers and sisters, I'll tell you that those close bonds, they don't happen by accident or they don't happen overnight. It requires effort and intention. That's why it's important for us to be together to come and worship. It's also important to spend time together outside of the assembly so that we can get to know each other on a deeper level so that we can have a close bond. Jesus says if your brother sins against you also notice this is talking about sin if he sins against you. This is not some pet peeve of mine, something that annoys me about another person or that just really bothers me or gets on my nerves. These are true, legitimate dva deviations of God's Word. The ESV translates verse 15, as if your brother sins against you. The New American Standard just says if your brother sins and it omits that phrase against you, and the reason for that is there's a textual variants some of the manuscripts contain the phrase, and some do not. If you're reading from the New King James or the ESV. And the brother sins against you, this would be referring to a situation where you are personally affected by something, somebody misleads you, they lie to you, they steal from you, or they slander or harm you, in some way they are sinning against you. But if it's omitted, that they will just say if your brother sins that's more generic, it's not necessarily something that harmed me or impacted me personally. But rather, they're just caught up in some type of wrong. And now it'd be consistent with other passages like Galatians chapter six, and verse one. It says brothers, if anyone is caught in any transgression, you who are spiritual should restore him in a spirit of gentleness. Keep watch on yourself. lest you to be tempted Galatians, six, one, it's probably helpful for, for us to think about both of these situations, whether it's a sin against me personally, or whether it's just a brother who has fallen into sin. But notice what Jesus says that we are to do here. When this occurs, he says, we are to go and tell him his fault. Go and tell him his fault, not go and tell the elders, his fault, or the preacher, or go and tell your friends or someone else at coffee or lunch or go and tell social media. But instead we are to approach and discuss the matter with that person, the one who has committed the wrong. That phrase, go and tell him that's a strong term, the New American Standard says to show him his fault. The NIV says point out their fault. The Holman Christian Bible says to rebuke Him. The root of that word is also used in Luke chapter three, and verse 19. When John the Baptist goes, and he reproves Herod because he had taken her Rhodius, his brother Philips wife. Notice the setting of this exchange, it is between you and him alone. When I was in sixth grade, I had a little incident at school, I got sent to the,

Conrad Harkrider  11:39
the principal's office for getting into a fight with my best friend, we were at the lunch room, and I guess I said something. And so he took my drink that was sitting on the table, he started to pour it onto the table, and then eventually pouring it onto my pans. And so naturally, I poured some onto his pants. And, and then at that point, he smashed a cupcake on my head, you know, things are escalating when you're willing to give up your cupcake in a fight. But we were eventually taken to the principal's office. And the whole thing played out in front of everyone that was sitting there eating. You know how things tend to escalate when we get into a confrontation with someone. And there are other eyes watching. And we tend to sharpen our words, we escalate our voices, we defend our honor. Jesus says that this should be dealt with in private, not causing a huge scene or making a big thing out of this. But instead we're addressing the matter one on one. Verse 16, says that if he does not listen, if your own individual attempt is not successful, then the next step would be to take one or two others with you. To address him. This is a quote from Deuteronomy, chapter 19, and verse 15. In the law of Moses, they were not allowed to convict a person on a crime based upon one person's testimony they had to take, they had to corroborate that account with two or three witnesses. And so in this instance, the brother who has been entrapped by sin is to be approached by other individuals that go with you. And they play a certain role. First of all, they could be witnesses, if they have personal knowledge or information about what's going on the sin that's occurred, they can support and hold up this call for repentance. They should also be in a position to make a judgment. They can listen to both sides, they can hear the other person's perspective and side of the story, they should be unbiased. This is not going and finding a couple of my closest friends that that agree with me and then going to tell this person how wrong they are to convince them that they're wrong. It's not a mob following where we are trying to restore this person and not condemned them. It's also prudent if these people have some sort of relationship with the person. If they know then if they are respected by this person. Maybe if they know their family, well, they have some history with them, then that can be beneficial when they're making this appeal. And again, it may be wise to take someone who is older than me, not just a two or three people that are of my same age but five I need someone with more experience and more life perspective.

Conrad Harkrider  15:05
In verse 17, he says that if they refuse to listen to them, then tell it to the church. In the Gospels, the church is only mentioned two times. Both times are in the Gospel of Matthew. The first time is in Matthew chapter 16, and verse 18. When Jesus says that upon this rock, I will build my church. And the second instance is here. This is referring to a local congregation. Instead of now, just a few trying to appeal to this person, one reaching out, or one or two reaching out. Now we are bringing in the entire assembly, the whole congregation, the full body of believers, and this is where prayer becomes critical. Now, instead of just one person praying, or a couple of people praying for this brother or sister, now you have hundreds of people who are lifting up their voices to the Father, the church should be united in the effort of trying to restore brothers and sisters. In first Corinthians chapter five, we're told about a man who took his father's wife, and apparently there was, there was inconsistency with how that was being handled. Some people had reported this back to Paul and told him what was happening. Others seem to be looking over it, they seem to be okay with what was occurring. There should be unity and consistency in the way that the local church addresses sin among its members. Verse 17, the second half of 17, it says that if he refuses, even to listen to the church, let him be to you as a Gentile, and a tax collector. Jesus loved all men, he loved Gentiles, and tax collectors, he spent time with these groups that were marginalized. But here he's using them to make a point these people were not welcomed among the Jews, they would have been considered outsiders on the on the fringes. And Jesus emphasizes that when a brother persists, and sin is not willing to repent, and turn back, there's a there's a change in the relationship, the way that they are treated and viewed, is now different. They are no longer seen as a part of the assembly, they're viewed as an outsider. Let me ask you, as we step through this process, here, these these guidelines or this instruction that Jesus gives. Is this a process that we follow today, when dealing with brothers and sisters? Do we go to people and approach them when there's some type of issue or sin that's occurred? Or do we tell others? Do we go and talk to others about it? Are there multiple attempts that are made? Or is it just a single phone call? And then and then we don't hear from them again? Do we sever ties with people in order that they may be brought back to the Lord. So that would have an effect on them, they would be pricked and turned back to God. I want to make a few observations about this, and then the lesson will be yours. First of all. Notice that the goal in this process, the purpose, the reason why we are doing this thing, these things is to win the person back. Look at what he says in 15 of the second half of 15. He says, If he hears you, you have gained your brother. That's what it's all about. We're trying to restore and gain our brother. This is intended to be productive. We're not trying to embarrass someone, we're not trying to single them out. We're not trying to get an apology out of them, so that they will make things right with me. But instead, this is about bringing them back to the Lord. I knew of a situation with

Conrad Harkrider  19:47
a young guy, he was dating this girl and they both went to the same congregation. And they ended up breaking up and she had family that was at that congregation had been going there for While and he was not as connected didn't have as many long term connections. And so he stopped attending there started going somewhere else. Breakups are never easy. And his decision to go to another place was understandable. But when reflecting on everything that had happened, he said that there was hardly anyone from the church that reached out to him. And from his perspective, he felt like he has lost this close relationship. He's had to go to another church, he's feeling really low, and no one had reached out. When there's a brother or sister who is struggling, do we think about what they are going through what they're dealing with what they're facing? Or are we more concerned with choosing a side, or finding the right group to go along with Jesus is a good shepherd. And as the Good Shepherd, he cares about all of his sheep, not just the ones that are healthy and doing well and are liked by all the others. But he is willing to leave the flock and go after the one who is stringy, and we have to have that same desire. In this process, we need to be careful about drawing conclusions. So often we see something happening and we can make an assumption about what's going on there. And that's why it's important to go directly to the brother or sister so that the matter can be settled one on one so that it can be resolved. And oftentimes, if there is a misunderstanding, it can come out and in a private setting. In First Samuel chapter one, when Hannah and her husband go to the tabernacle to make an offering, the priest Eli observes her there and she is moving her mouth, but nothing is coming out. And he makes the assumption that she is drunk even even goes up to her. And he says, You need to put away your wine. As it turns out, she wasn't drunk, she was making this heartfelt appeal to the Lord in her distress. It's important for us not to judge based upon appearances or hearsay, but to go directly to the brother or sister. Also notice that this is something that requires effort. There is action that has to be taken. Sometimes when a person is going through something, or they they stop, they're not as connected to the group, the group of Christians, there is a tendency just to let it play itself out, to just watch it occur and just sort of to step back and and stay out of it. But what Jesus outlines here is is so much different than that. This is a real concerted effort to bring the person back. This is not just one phone call, or one attempt that is made. This is different people from different angles and different approaches over a long over a period of time, in the hopes of restoring or bringing this person back. There is persistence involved. A while back there was someone that come in that came and knocked on our door. And they asked us if we had seen their their dog. And unfortunately, we we hadn't and but they were going around knocking on the doors of the neighborhood. Putting up signs, I think they even were offering some kind of reward if the animal was found and returned safely. Would you do that for your pet? Maybe for your dog? Or your I don't know if people do that for their cats. But would you go and search the neighborhood for your last animal? What if it was not your pets? What if it was one of your children? Your child didn't come home from school that day. Now, what is your response? Now we're searching endlessly. We are using every resource we're calling for help or raising awareness because it's a serious issue there is there's a lot at stake there. This is a potentially life and death situation. When a brother or sister becomes entangled or trapped

Conrad Harkrider  24:47
in sin, it is a life or death situation spiritually speaking. Are we willing to put forth the same amount of effort for a brother or sister as we would for or other aspects or situations in our life. We had a, an issue at the house a couple of years ago where there was a tiny little crack in the shower. And the shower still worked. So I didn't think much of it. But over time that crack started to widen and get bigger and bigger. And I thought, the shower still works. And we just kind of continue on down the path until one day we're down in the kitchen, and there's a water spot on the ceiling. And now all of a sudden, you think, oh, no, we've got a problem here. You see what happens if we just allow sin to kick continue on just to go down its path, and sort of turn our backs to it to to ignore it to act like there's nothing wrong, like there's nothing going on there. The problem doesn't just all of a sudden go away, it progresses it gets worse and worse. Helping a brother or sister it requires time, and effort, and energy. But when that brother returns or sister returns to the Lord, Jesus says that the angels in Heaven are rejoicing, whatever amount of effort we had to put in is well worth the work. Finally, we must be moved with compassion. This is not a cold and just a legal process that we're moving through here. We should be motivated and moved by a heart of, of compassion, of of mercy that we're extending towards this person. In Matthew chapter 18, when Jesus is telling the parable about the unforgiving servant, He says in verse 27, then the master of that servant was moved with compassion, released him and forgave him the debt, this incredible sum that there was no way that he could ever possibly repay. His master releases him of this, because he has moved with compassion. In verse 33, the same chapter, after going in and holding his fellow servant and asking for him to repay his debt. The Master says, Should you not also have had compassion on your fellow servant just as I had pity on you? And the parallel is that all of us who are in Christ, we have received immeasurable grace and mercy and compassion from God. And so how can we not extend that same love and care and understanding to those who are falling have fallen down in sin. When we reach out and try to help someone, it's not because we are better than they are. It's not because we are somehow more spiritual than them. But rather, we realize that we are just a few steps from stumbling that all of us at any point, could be entrapped or ensnared by the devil's lies. When we're moved with compassion, it helps us to be to be understanding, to be patient, to put ourselves in that person's situation, to see it from their perspective. That's humbling ourselves. It's what the Lord did for us when he lowered himself and came to live as a man. Compassion helps us to be unselfish. We look at the needs of others, we reach out to those who are on the fringes, we think about those who may be hurting or going through a difficulty. And so instead of just thinking about the people that I'm close to my friends, my family, the people that I enjoy being with, we start to look outside of ourselves. And we reach out to those who are maybe may not be as connected to the group or who don't fit in as easily. When God asked Cain, Where is your brother Abel?

Conrad Harkrider  29:44
You remember Kane's response? Am I my brother's keeper? Am I supposed to keep up with my brother? Am I supposed to know where he is? And what he's doing? The answer is? Yes. Oh, All of us have a responsibility to take care and to look after our brothers and sisters to treat them just as we do, to treat as our own family to treat them as family.

Conrad Harkrider  30:19
We have sung a number of songs today that talk about the grace and the compassion of God, the sacrifice of Jesus, how, how valuable that is to us. And it's important to remember that when a brother has stumbled and fallen, the Lord is waiting for their return his grace is immeasurable. it far exceeds anything that we can comprehend. And he is looking to restore them and to bring them back. We're going to close tonight with a song if there's anyone here who needs to respond to the Lord's invitation, you can do that tonight to confess your sins will pray on your behalf, to submit your life and your heart to God. If there's something that we can do to encourage you, please come down to the front as we stand and sing
