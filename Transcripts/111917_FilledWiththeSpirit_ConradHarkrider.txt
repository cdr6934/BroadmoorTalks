Well, it's good to see each of you here this morning, it's good to be together and to be able to study and worship and praise God as in one, faith has a common brothers and sisters in Christ. If you have your Bibles and want to be turning to Ephesians, chapter five

Conrad Harkrider  00:32
we're gonna be studying from Ephesians chapter five this morning. Have you ever been to one of those restaurants where you can go through the line and pick out the ingredients for the dish, it's like a stir fry type of meal. They call it the Mongolian barbecue. But basically, the way it works is they have different types of meat, beef, and chicken and fish. And then all kinds of vegetables and you go through and and choose the things that you want, put them into your bowl. And then they have sauces and different types of spices. And then you take all of that over to the big iron griddle, and they start to fry it up for you, I shouldn't be talking about food this close to lunch. But if you're not aware, if it's your first time to go to a plate place like this, you might not realize that there is a technique to doing this. Because they don't charge you by the ounce. It's it's typically by the bowl. So anything that you can fit into the bowl is is your seats, and the more you get in there, the bigger your meal is. So there's a strategy to this, you start with the meat on the bottom, and you pack that in as much as you possibly can. And then you move on to the vegetables, but not the big bulky vegetables like the broccoli, you stay away from those. They don't taste that great anyways. So a few vegetables and then another layer of meat on top of that to sort of pack everything down. And then at the very end, it's the snap peas on the side. And those kind of serve as a support system sort of like a wall to just hold everything in. Some of the guys are nodding, they know what I'm talking about here. And then you slowly carry that over to the fryer and they cook it up for you. filling up your bowl. In the book of Ephesians. Paul talks a lot about fullness, and uses the word several times. In Ephesians chapter five, he gives a command a directive about what God's people are to be filled up with. Read with me in Ephesians chapter five beginning in verse 15. It says see that you walk circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise, Redeeming the time because the days are evil. Therefore do not be unwise, but understand what the will of the Lord is. And do not be drunk with wine in witch's dissipation. But be filled with the Spirit speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord, Giving thanks always for all things to God the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, submitting to one another in the fear of God. My daughter recently asked me, she said, why do we still have that sign from VBS? Up at the church building? I said, Well, that's because that's our theme for the entire year for 2017. Kingdom citizens. And we've had a number of lessons about that topic. And some of those have centered on what it means to be a citizen to be a member of the kingdom. What does that say about our character and our attitude and our approach and our walk in this life? It tells us about our identity, who we are as people we are citizens of the kingdom of God.

Conrad Harkrider  04:31
Here in Philippians are here in Ephesians chapter five. Paul emphasizes that those who are following after Christ those who are citizens of the king, are people who are filled with the Spirit. Kingdom citizens are those who have been filled up with the Spirit of God. So let's look at this text this morning. As we notice some of the qualities and characteristics of these of these individuals of these people. First of all, notice verse 15. In verse 15, he says, See that you walk circumspectly, not as fools. but as wise, we see that people who are filled with the Spirit are those who are walking wisely. In verse 15, he says that you are to be circumspect, that carries with it the idea of being alert, looking around, being aware of your surroundings. If you think about someone who is walking down some steps, maybe they are wet, or they're covered in some type of ice or frost, you're going to be very cautious when you're doing that, you're going to look where you're about to step you're going to be holding on to the rail for extra stability and support. Because there's a threat there, there's danger in your path. And so it is with the Christian walk, it should be handled with the same type of care. We should be walking carefully and wisely. In this world. The instructions that God has given to us are not intended to take the fun out of life. They're not designed to put a burden on us to make our lives harder and more difficult. But instead, God has given us these things, for our benefit to protect us, and to shield us. The book of Proverbs is the Book about wisdom. And in Proverbs chapter three and verse 17, speaking of wisdom, it says that her ways are ways of pleasantness, and all her paths are peace, she is a tree of life to those who lay hold of her, those who hold her fast, are blessed. Is the path that you and I are walking in is that the way of pleasantness could we describe our path as a path of peace as one that leads to life?

Conrad Harkrider  07:15
Those who are walking wisely, that path can only be found by the one that God has laid out for us. So we are to walk wisely. And part of that. Verse 16, Ephesians. Five, is to redeem the time, because the days are evil. Redeeming the time literally means to buy it up. Like it's a precious commodity that we see time and we realize how significant or valuable this this asset or this gift is. And so we make the most of every opportunity that we have. We have a limited amount of time here on this earth, the psalmist in Psalm 144, in verse four, he says that our life is like a breath, he compares it to a shadow that just passes it goes very quickly. And if you've lived for any amount of time, you know that 10 years is, is nothing. It goes by in a blink and we're in one stage today. And soon it passes away. And so how are we using our time verse 16, says that the days are evil. And that goes back to those dangers around us. There are a plethora of ways that we can waste our time. Instead of using it for productive and healthy and godly means we can spend our time doing things that ultimately don't really add value or purpose to our life. Technology is a it's a great asset. But have you ever done this, you get home at the end of the day, and you plop yourself down on the couch. And then you pull out the phone or the computer, you turn on the TV and all of a sudden, it's nine o'clock. You haven't accomplished anything. You've just spent that whole time and you don't even really know what you were doing. And so technology can can become this black hole of taking away from us it becomes a great source of wasted time.

Conrad Harkrider  09:36
You know, Satan loves that unplanned, idle time. It's perfect for temptation, and for drawing us away in our lusts. And so he takes that and uses it against us. Walking wisely means that we use the hours in the day for godly, productive purposes. And so we need to get busy working for the Lord. Also notice for 17, he says, Do not be unwise, but understand what the will of the Lord is. Wisdom comes by understanding and acknowledging and following the will of the Lord. And that's easier said than done. Sometimes I find myself making my decisions, planning out my course, deciding where my life is going to go. And then I asked God to sort of rubber stamp that or to help me get there, God, here's what I want, can you enable me to have that? Instead of saying, God, can you make this happen, we should be asking, Lord, is this the right direction? Is this the right path? Is this the right way that you want me to be headed? Is this where I'm supposed to be? Understanding his will and not just my own. Ephesians chapter one and verse nine, says that God, in these times has made known to us the mystery of his will, and what a blessing it is that we now can have full understanding into God's will for us. And we need to be seeking that out in our prayers as we walk and live in this world. So people who are filled with the Spirit or those who walk wisely, we also see from verse 18, that people who are filled with the Spirit or those who are controlled by his will, notice again, verse 18, it says, Do not be drunk with wine, which is in which is dissipation, but be filled with the Spirit. There's a contrast here between those who are drunk or filled up with wine. And then those who are filled with the spirits. Alcohol has become a social norm in our culture, everybody drinks, when you go to the restaurant, people are drinking, when you go to the dinner party, people are drinking. If you go to the wedding, then people are drinking. It seems to be a part of every aspect of our lives. commercials on TV are filled with ads that are promoting beer and other types of strong, strong drink. And what is everybody doing in those commercials. There's these beautiful women and these good looking guys, and they're having a good time. They're kicking back, they're relaxing, they're enjoying life. Alcohol provides a sense of escape. It allows people to take the edge off of stress and anxiety or despair, and the reality of life. And it gives people an outlet, something to help them to relax. But really what's happening in all that is a loss of control. We lose our ability to make good decisions, our senses become dull, our judgment is impaired. The CDC reports that alcohol is responsible for 88,000 deaths per year in the United States alone. Next time somebody asks you why you don't drink, you can tell them that there are 88,000 reasons. And that's not to mention the millions of Americans that are addicted to alcohol. And I am certain that if we went around the room this morning, we could give example after example of people whose lives have been affected by friends or family members who have been negatively impact by this. Oh, but it's it's so much fun. It's so much glamour and this is the way that you can enjoy your life to be filled up with life.

Conrad Harkrider  14:34
Paul says it's dissipation. It's debauchery, which means excessive indulgence. It's reckless. It's wasteful. It makes you think of the the type of living from the prodigal son where his father had given him something this this inheritance and then he takes it to a far country and he spends it away. And so it is the same for us. When we allow ourselves to be controlled by something that is so damaging. And it's not just alcohol, it could be drugs, or it could be pornography, or it could be something like greed or the desire to have more where our lives are now being guided and directed and pushed by this desire. The point is that we are going to be filled up with something. We're different from animals, animals, they act based upon instincts, plants and trees. They don't have thoughts or emotions or feelings, or passions. But God made us in His image, we are designed to be filled with something. We are people who are impressionable, we're able to learn, we're able to change and understand and comprehend, and we are passionate and emotional, and we are made to seek after something to live with purpose and meaning. We're made to care about something. And the question is, what are we putting in that void? What are we filling ourselves up with in this life? What is it that is controlling and guiding and moving us? In Isaiah chapter 55 And verse six. The Prophet says, Seek the Lord while He may be found call upon Him while He is near. Let the wicked forsake his way and the unrighteous man his thoughts, let him return to the Lord, that He may have compassion on him, and to the end to our God, for He will abundantly pardon. You notice what he says, There we are, to seek the Lord. And practically speaking, what that means is that we're to forsake our ways, which are often wicked, were to put aside our thoughts which are often unrighteous, and return to the Lord, filling up our conduct and our mind and our life with his ways, rather than our own. So being filled with the spirit is being controlled by the will of God. We think about being filled, what does that look like? Some of us may be uncomfortable, if I said, Are you filled with the Spirit, you may feel a little uneasy, saying yes, I am filled up with the Spirit. And I think part of that is because of the misuse by some groups in the religious world that have taken being filled with the Spirit and that they have equated that with some type of irrational praise or activity. In a worship, where people are almost out of their minds, they're talking in gibberish, they're rolling around on the floor, that jumping up and down is that what it means to be filled with the spirits. When you think about being filled, also, remember that this language is used in reference to being filled by God to being filled by Christ. Look at a couple of examples with me in Ephesians chapter one, in verse 22, this is talking about Christ. Ephesians chapter one and verse 22.

Conrad Harkrider  18:44
It says, And he put all things under his feet, and gave Him to be head over all things to the church, which is His body, the fullness of Him, who fills all in all. Christ fills all in all, look at Ephesians chapter four, and verse 10, Ephesians, four in verse 10, it says, speaking again of Christ, He who descended is also the one who ascended far above the heavens, that he might fill all things. And then also in Ephesians, chapter three and verse 19. It says, to know the love of Christ was which passes knowledge, that you may be filled with all the fullness of God. So you see, we're not just filled with the Spirit, we're filled with God and with Christ. And when we say that we're not saying that Christ is somehow taking over my actions that have become a robot and I can no longer control the things that I'm doing. Instead it is that Christ compels us that He guides us that he directs and orders our lives. So how does this work? Well, it's helpful also, to notice the parallel passage in Colossians chapter three, and verse 15. In Colossians, three in verse 15, Paul says, Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts, to which indeed you are called in one body and be thankful. Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly teaching and admonishing one another in all wisdom, singing psalms, and hymns and spiritual songs with thankfulness in your hearts to God. He says that the peace of Christ should rule in our hearts. And then in verse 16, that the word of Christ would dwell in us. So to be filled up with the spirit is the same as saying to be filled with the word of Christ, that the peace of Christ is guiding us or is working in our lives. Also, we think about being filled with the Spirit. Notice what the result or the outcome is, for those who are filled with the Spirit in verse 19, Ephesians, five, he gives five words that end in ing Active Words, those are present participles, he says, that they will then be addressing, they will be singing and making, they will be giving and submitting. That those that's the outcome of those who are filled up in this way, those are the things that they are going to be engaging in or doing. And notice that the first and the last relate to our relationships with one another, we are speaking or addressing one another. And then in verse 21, we are submitting to one another. And then the ones in the middle there relates to our relationship and our connection to God. We make melody in our heart, to the Lord. And then in verse 20, we give thanks always, and for everything, to God the Father. So let's look at that. The first and the last one there, the addressing one another, and the submitting to one another. What we see here is that those who are filled with the Spirit, are mindful of others.

Conrad Harkrider  22:38
To say that you are controlled and order your life is ordered by the Lord, is to say that you care about other people. When we think of worship, we often think in terms of the vertical, that this is something between me and God, I've come to offer my praise up to God. And that is true, there is a sense that we do honor God in our worship. But there's also another aspect of this, that we have come to encourage and help those around us. And that's why you can't just stay at your house and worship. You can't just listen to the podcast or watch on live stream. I'm thankful that we have those but they will never replace our essential need to be together to encourage one another. It is a fundamental need that we have. And so when I'm singing the songs like we did this morning, I'm speaking to you you're addressing me we're building one another up. Have you noticed how singing allows us to express things that we sometimes have difficulty saying, just in regular conversation? If I went up to the group of guys, and I said, Hey, I just want you to know that I love you, with the love of the Lord. I might get some looks like what has gotten into this guy. But when we sing it allows us to open up to express what's in our heart in ways that we may not otherwise be able to say. We say to our brothers, and our sisters, I care about you. I'm concerned for you. I'm pulling for you keep fighting, don't give up don't quit, be faithful remain pure. Those are all things that come out in our singing and we shouldn't lose sight of that. One of the primary aspects of why we sing is to build up is to help and strengthen and encourage one another in verse 21 He says Ephesians 521, that we are to be submitting to one another out of fear or reverence for Christ. Because of our commitment and devotion to Christ, we submit to one another, we often think of submission in terms of the husband and the wife, which Paul talks about in chapter five and verse 22. Or we think in terms of parents and children, which he addresses in chapter six, and verse one, but really submission is something that all Christians should put on. It's an attitude that we should all exhibit in our relationships with one another. And the model for that is, of course, Christ. And Mark chapter 10. And verse 45. It says, For even the Son of Man came not to be served, but to serve and give his life as a ransom for many. Jesus, the creator, the one who made all things if he was able to come and serve sinful man, and surely you and I can put the needs of our brothers and sisters ahead of our own. Well, how does that look? Practically speaking, it comes out in the things that we say when we have conversations. And we ask a brother and sister, how are you doing? How's it going? We inquire about their life. It comes out when we have a social engagement. And we invite people who we may not be best friends with people who may be different from us. And we're inclusive of all of our brothers and sisters. And it also shows in our attitude, we are constantly thinking about how does this affect another person, how's this going to go across are going to impact my brother or sister. But those who are filled with the Spirit will be conscientious and mindful of other people. And finally, those who are filled will be genuinely thankful to God. That's what we see in the praise. These are people who are coming and they are grateful they were filled with gratitude in their hearts. And that is being expressed through their praise to God. Our praise to God is something that should come from the heart. Did you notice that? And in chapter five, and verse 19, it says that we are to sing and make melody in our heart to the Lord, this is something that should come from inside of us.

Conrad Harkrider  27:39
Do we offer a passionate, spirit filled worship from the heart? I want you to think about some other areas of life, people who go to support their favorite sports team. What does that look like? They stand up, they clap. They throw their hands up in the air. They get really excited. They jump up and down. Does anyone have to tell them? Now listen, when the team gets a score, I want you to act like you're really excited. No, it's just it flows out of them. This is something that they care about. They spend their time their money, their energy, their focus. And so when they're together with their, their family, they show that team spirit, it's it's radiating out of them. Has our worship to God become something that is mechanical and stale, and lifeless. I'm not saying that we need to jump up and down and act all crazy like we're in a rock concert. But worship should never be something that is just going through the motions. Notice you can't fake melody in your heart. It has to move you and stir you it has to come from deep inside of us. People who are filled with the spirits are overflowing with gratitude and thankfulness. And that's something that we do every single day. And so then when we come into here together, it's like the lid is just bursting off the top. We can't even contain it. It just flows out in prays to God. It's a reflection of what's already happening inside of us. Not forcing ourselves to just go through the motions. Spirit filled worship. And then in verse 20, he says that we are to give thanks, always for all things. You want to know if somebody is filled with the Spirit It's a person who is thankful. Somebody who is always expressing gratitude, somebody who's looking at their life, and they're saying this is a blessing from God. I'm grateful for these things, I can see how God is working in this area. And they're optimistically looking at all that God is fulfilling in their life. Jesus once told about a poor man who was covered in source. And he didn't have anything going for him, he was laid at the gate of a certain rich man, and he was there just in the hopes that he could get some of the scraps that fell off of his table. He was treated more like a dog or an animal than a person, the dogs would come and lick his sores. And it seemed as if no one cared about him, except his father in heaven. Because when he finally died, Jesus says that the angels came and carried his body away to a place of comfort, and rest. No matter what we go through in this life, we can always be thankful that God is right there with us, that he is a constant source of strength and support that that He will never leave us. And that's why Paul says in Second Corinthians chapter nine, in verse 15, and speaking about Christ, He says, Thanks be to God for His in describable gift. We could talk all day about the blessings we have living in this country, the the food and the security and the opportunities and the houses and the clean water and the list goes on and on. But aside from all of those things, what you and I have been given in Jesus Christ far surpasses any blessing that we can find in this life. What are you and I being filled up with? What are we pouring in to our cup? Have we loaded it up with the things of this world to where there's no more room for God and His Spirit and His purposes? Or are we emptying ourselves when

Conrad Harkrider  32:31
we come to Christ and allowing our heart to be filled up to be controlled by the Lord and by His will? We're going to close this morning with a song and it's an opportunity to encourage everyone who is here if there's something that we can do to help you to support you in your walk. Then use this opportunity as a way to reach reach out for prayers or support. While together we stand and sing
