Good morning. It's good to see everyone here today, it's always a good day when we can gather together and worship our God, it has been extremely beneficial to be here, we've been able to study from the book of Acts. And in the back, I'm sure there are different subjects that were study, we've been able to sing together, been able to pray together, take to the Lord's Supper. So it's been good to be here. And if you're visiting with us, we certainly appreciate the fact that you're here to worship with us. We live in a prosperous country, that's probably not news to any of you. But it's something we need to be reminded of. In fact, the prosperity of our country is really unrivaled throughout throughout history, what we have is a tremendous a lot of wealth, a few of any places in the rest of the world, or, like I mentioned, throughout history had been able to claim to have what we have as a nation. And just to give you an indication of the wealth that we have in this country, we have about four and a half percent of the world's population, but a quarter or 25% of the world's wealth. The median wealth per adult in this country is 66,000, as of 2017, while the continent of Africa has 1200, an annual or a wealth amount of $1,200. And in India, it's $3,000 66,000 Compared to 3012 126 countries, mostly in Africa and Sub Saharan Africa, and some of Asia have a medium wealth of less than $1,000. We're tremendously blessed in this country. There are 700 million people in the world, or just under 10% of the world's population that still live in extreme poverty and extreme poverty is defined as less than $1.90 a day 700 million people in the world have less to live on than $2 a day. And that's 10% of the population. We live in extraordinary times. And we have a tremendous amount of wealth. And what I want you to see is that God has blessed us in many ways. And what we have really is a blessing. I don't wish poverty on anyone. But what I'd like to suggest is with those blessings also come challenges. So I'd like to talk for just a few moments this morning about the challenges of living in a prosperous country. Now there's many things we could do to outline the the blessings of living in a prosperous country. But what I want to consider this morning are the challenges. Money is not sinful. In fact, it's needed to provide the basic necessities of life. So it's not sinful, really, to be rich, or to be poor. Neither one of those determines our standing before God. But we need to understand that there are challenges that arise with both of those scenarios being rich and poor. And proverbs 30, verses eight and nine. There it says remove far from a falsehood in line give me neither poverty nor riches, feed me with the food that

Jeremy Sweets  03:29
is needful for me, lest I be full and deny you and say who is the Lord, or lest I be poor, and steal and profane the name of my God? In that an interesting statement, I know Conrad's preached a lesson on this text as well before. But here he asked the question asked God give me neither poverty, nor riches. And we're very used to that concept of give me not poverty. He says, For else there, I might be tempted to steal in order to provide for myself, but it might be a little unusual to hear the words do not give me well, do not give me prosperity. And the reason I believe that he says that is that it can be a challenge in life. The challenge that he points to is that he might be full and deny you say, Who is the Lord, I have everything that I need. So I think the writer of Proverbs provides helpful practical wisdom, that wealth provides challenges, and we need to understand that so let's consider some of the challenges of living in a prosperous country. First of all, there's the challenge of greed. Greed is an excessive desire, especially for wealth or possessions. Greed is something that always wants more and more. You would think that if a country had an abundance had plenty that that would satisfy then. But I don't think that's the case. And that's not how greed works. And Ecclesia pleasee assays, chapter five, verse 10, says he who loves money will not be satisfied with money, nor he who loves well with his income. Notice what that says and, and let that seep into your heart, the one that loves money, will not be satisfied with money, there's never going to be enough, there's never going to be something that says, I've reached the point where I have enough and I have what I need. Greed always wants more and more and more. We live in a materialistic society, the heroes of our culture, I would say are our actors, athletes, musicians, people that are very talented in their fields, but they are people that often make a lot of money. And people idolize those people and the lifestyle that it produces. I'm reminded of some athletes that come into a tremendous amount of money, and they may have never had money before. And so they are spending and spending and spending. And it's a matter of status, to be able to say, look how big my chain is, or look how much money I have. And we watch that and say, I want to be like that. I want to have what they have. But sadly, it's never enough. I've heard of athletes talk about and some athletes that have been upset about the fact that they've spent all their money and they no longer have money, but the pressure that is there, to have that status to look important to look like you belong to look like you do that. And the way you do that is through your possessions and your money. And I think that influences us, we see that mentality. And society seeps into our hearts. And we have a lot, and we want more and more and more. In this country, I believe we have a real challenge of greed. Now that's not nice to say. And that may be a little uncomfortable. It's I don't want to be greedy. That's, we know that's a bad thing. But it is a challenge living in a prosperous country. The Bible warns against the love of money, as well as the love of things in First Timothy six verses nine and 10. But those who desire to be rich fall into temptation into a snare into many senseless and harmful desires that plunge people into ruin and destruction. For the love of money is the root of all kinds of evils. It is through his this craving that some have wandered away from the faith and pierced themselves with many pains. I think this gets at the heart of what greed is notice the words that are used, it says it is a desire, it is a love, it is a craving.

Jeremy Sweets  08:04
And those that love, money will never be satisfied by it. But notice not only that, but it becomes such an obsession that it rivals what is good. Even for a Christian it can lead them away from a knowledge of God and from following after God. What is strangely important can be replaced by what is fleeting and trivial in the grand scheme of things, the love of money. We also see in first John two and verse 15, Do not love the world or the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him. For all that is in the world, the desires of the flesh and desires of the eyes and the pride of life is not from the Father, but it's from the world. As Christians, we sing the song that this world is not my home. Well is it? Is it our home? We know as Christians that it's not and it shouldn't be. But if we're comfortable in this life, it's easy to say no, I'm fine here, this should be my home, I'm enjoying life, I have everything that I need or want. And we begin to love this world. And we have a lot of mighty nice and fine things and we love the things of this world. And so as Christians live in a very prosperous country, we need to be aware of that challenge. And it is a challenge we have to take seriously. Not only greed, but also we experienced the challenge of covetousness and this is related to greed but to cover it simply means to desire wrongfully inordinately or without due regard for the rights of others. It's when it's when desire becomes seems something that is out of place. It doesn't have its proper place of meeting needs, but it comes in obsession or it becomes something that is desired in the wrong way. In Colossians, three and verse five, it says, Put to death, therefore what is earthly in you? Sexual immorality, impurity, passion, evil desire, and covetousness, which is idolatry. Notice here that covetousness is considered to be idolatry, or the worship of something other than God. And like greed, this gets at the heart of what's involved. It is a strong desire, almost a worship, a placing on a panel of things. This country certainly has a problem with coveting, doesn't it wanting what others have, again, we look at those athletes or musicians, we say, I want that I want their wealth, or I want their talents. On a smaller scale, it may be simply that we want the newest iPhone, the newest tablet, the newest gadgets, we spend all of our time wanting what others have, instead of simply enjoying what we already do have. And again, we have an abundance, don't we, but we're not concentrating on that. We're looking to what is next, we're looking to what is out there. Now we do live in a capitalist society, and people have learned what's best to make money. And so when a product has a new feature, guess what that makes national news. There's a there's a show where they say, we got this new feature and this new feature and this new feature, and people watch around this country and say I want that. I've got to have that. It's the newest and the best. And so we covet, we desire, we want in an inordinate way. What we don't have, not only do we covet things and possessions, but we covet much else as well. We open up Facebook, and we covet other people's smiles, and their happiness, their vacations, their experiences, I wish I had that. Facebook shows a lot of happiness. Not everyone is that happy all the time. I hate to tell you that. But we see that. And we say I want that. I want that for myself. And so we become obsessed with what is out there. Rather than simply appreciating and enjoying what we have. In Luke chapter 12, there is a man in the crowd and he had an opportunity to speak to Jesus and guess what he said? Lord,

Jeremy Sweets  12:51
tell my brother to divide the inheritance with me. If you have one opportunity, what would you bring up? Well, he brought up the inheritance. That's what was on his mind. And that's what he asked them Jesus. Jesus said in Luke chapter 12, verse 15, take care and be on your guard against all covetousness. For one's life does not consist in the abundance of his possessions. We need to hear that again, don't wait. One's life does not consist in the abundance of his possessions. That is not what life's about. Jesus told the parable of the rich fool. This is a man who had a great deal of wealth. And he stored the grain that he had, and he built barns and bigger barns, and he says, you have everything you need. And he took comfort in that. He took comfort in that. But God came to him and said, You fool this night your soul is required of you. How many of us are the rich fool? How many rich fools are there in this country? Who say to themselves, I have what I need. I'm good, I'm comfortable. And God will say you're a fool. You're a fool. Well, in this country, I think we have a challenge of covetousness. We also have a set challenge of self reliance. And this is related to the last point we even see what the rich fool that man said, I have what I need. If you go through that parable, you see I and you could underscore it. It's there over and over again. I have built this it is mine. And I have done this. In our country. It's very common. If you find yourself in difficult circumstances, all you have to do is pull yourself up by your bootstraps, and that you can make it in this country. And that's that term simply means to elevate yourself without any outside help that you elevate yourself. Now, I agree that we should take initiative, I agree that we should be diligent workers But I disagree that there is anything that we can do in this life by ourselves. That what we accomplish in this life is not dependent upon God who gives us life and breath and strength, and even upon others who have trained us have given us education and experiences, we need others. And we need not think that we're the only ones here in this world. We're the only ones that self reliance is a destructive concept. When Paul was defending his ministry to the Corinthians, he stated in chapter in Second Corinthians three and verse five, not that we are sufficient in ourselves to claim anything is coming from us. But our sufficiency is from God, we need a healthy dose of dose of that statements, we are not sufficient in ourselves, we are not all that we need. We do not live by a bootstrap theology that says, I'm the only person out there and I'm the only one that makes a difference. Now we need God, we need others, God teaches us not to approach him with a self reliance attitude. And Deuteronomy chapter eights, as the Israelites were preparing to enter into Canaan, God tells them, beware, unless you say in your heart, my power and the light of my hand have gotten me this wealth, you shall remember the Lord your God, for it is he who gives you power to get wealth. And so just to reiterate the situation, they were going to go into the land of Canaan and be given that land be given cities that were already built, and structures that were already there, and they would come in and God would give them that land. But he says, You need to be careful that you do not say, I've gotten this because of my strength. You need to remember that God has given you this. Do we need that message any less. We say I've got this education, I worked hard, I've got this job. I've collected all this money for myself. And look what I've done. I've worked hard. I don't discount again, hard work. But I discount this idea of self reliance and that you're all that you need. We need to hear that message as well. Be aware, lest you say in your hearts, and we have that challenge in this country.

Jeremy Sweets  17:37
Salvation, our life is not due to what we do. In Ephesians, two, verses eight and nine. It says For by grace, you have been saved through faith, and that is not your own doing. It is the gift of God, not a result of works so that no man may boast. We've sinned in the presence of God, we deserve death. There's nothing we can do by ourselves to change that. We depend we need, we have to have God's grace and his mercy. And it's so essential that we do. It's so easy for us as Christians in this country to allow the culture to seep into us. So that we begin to think I've got everything that I need. I'm happy and good. And it's because of my own strength and my own power. Now, that's a challenge in this country. It's a challenge we need to be aware of. We also have the challenge of leisure, the challenge of leisure, there are 24 hours in the day. And that's not different here as it is in any other part of the world. And while there's the same amount of time, we need to understand that all people don't have the same amount of free time. We take it for granted that we have a 40 hour work week if you have a job or may go in school. But in general, we have that much time devoted to work and the rest of the time is ours. We have a tremendous amount of leisure at our disposal. That's not been true throughout history. People have busy themselves occupied themselves with attaining the necessities of law. Leisure was something reserved for only the extremely wealthy everyone else had to work and work and work in order to simply have food, clothing and shelter that occupied their time. But in this country, it's very common that we have time. Now like money, leisure time and recreation are not sinful. And that's not my point. But the question is how are we using this valuable commodity? Are we using our time and what is good or simply what is easy? One way I may ask that question. What I hear most talked about at work, are shows, television shows. And everyone knows every show that's on every streaming service. And they talk back and forth. And it, it's on a loop. They know what's there. That's how they spend their time. Now, I've been known to watch a show or two, but I hope I'm not consumed with that. My question is, how are we spending our time with something that is good or something that is simply easy? How are we spending our extra time? Is it as something that is important? Or something that is trivial? Do we spend our time do we give of our time, to God, to reading, studying, praying, to doing good for others, to seeking things that will better ourselves so that we might help other people, or is all of our spare time simply reserved for me time. And we need some me time when we busy and we do other things. But if that's all we have is me time, then there's a problem. Because this life is not about you. And it's not about me. And so we need to be careful with our time. One other connection with our time here is when it comes to possessions. Another thing that takes our time is possessions. And so there's the double whammy, so to speak of, of the greed and trying to accumulate, but it also zaps our time. I remember Gary Henry preaching a lesson from this pulpit in which he stated that everything that we bring into our house requires something of us, it commits us of our time. It takes time to move things around to place it on our house to maintain it, and then replace it when we want to get something else there. And sometimes we spend an awful lot of time with stuff. Is stuff wrong? Is it sinful to have things? No, it's not. But just practically speaking, that it's a valuable question to say is it worth it?

Jeremy Sweets  22:11
Sometimes we think we're very value conscious. Sometimes we think that if I can bring it into my house, it's free. But what Gary Henry reminded me of that truth is, it's not free, it costs you something probably in your time and energy and, and what it is in your mind to deal with that. That was a reminder I needed it was something helpful. In Ephesians five, verse 16, or verse 15. There it says, look carefully, then how you walk not as unwise, but as wise making the best use of the time, because the days are evil, we should fill our time with what is most important, not as what not with what is most immediate or easy or trivial. So we have a challenge of our time here in this country. Another challenge of living in a prosperous country is poverty. And that may seem backward, because there's a lot of prosperity isn't there here. But I believe that we make a mistake when we enjoy prosperity, and we think everyone else is in the same situation. There are poor people in this country, there is poverty in this country. And we need not look past that. We need not say that that's an inconvenience. I have everything I need, I'm comfortable. And I don't need to pay attention to that. Jesus says, the poor you have with you. Now, Judas was rebuking the fact that that ointment was used on Jesus and he says allow that to happen. You have the poor and you should address the poor. We live in a wealthy country. And as I mentioned, not everyone lives in the same conditions of wealth and prosperity. The wealth gap continues to grow, the rich get richer, richer, and the poor get poorer. And we shouldn't ignore the fact that poverty is in our own country. The the challenge we have I would suggest is that we would open our eyes to the plight of the poor. One of the most haunting scenes of all of Scripture is in Matthew chapter 25. It's a judgment scene. And people are separated into the left and to the right. And they're those that were pleasing to Jesus are those that serve Jesus. And they're a little bit confused when they're addressed with this and said, but we never saw you, Jesus. We never saw you. He said, When you fed, the hungry, when you close the naked when you visited those that were in prison, you did that to me. You see, when we extend the The love of Jesus to others, we're extending that same thing to Jesus and God Himself. In verse 40, he says, Truly I say to you, as you did it to one of the least of these, my brothers, you did it to me. Our challenge is to take note of those needs and those in need around us, and to seek to help them. We see in Galatians, chapter six, and I'll mention I noticed that it does say Matthew 24 Brothers, and so there may be some connotation of those that are of Christians. But I think it extends beyond that. And so the brotherhood of humanity in Galatians, six, in verse 10, it says, So then as we have opportunity, let us go do good to everyone, and especially to those who are the household of faith. So certainly, we need to help those that are Christians, those that are poor, but also those outside of the faith, we need to be an example and do what we can to to help to help. Not only that, but we also have many in this country that are in spiritual poverty. And they don't even realize it. There's a great deal of physical poverty, but think of how many people have everything that they need, but yet they're that rich, full. In Revelation, chapter three,

Jeremy Sweets  26:20
we see a letter addressed to the church at Laodicea. Now these are those that have confessed Christ, and that were Christians. But notice what it says about them in verse 15. I know your work, you're neither cold nor hot word that you were either cold or hot. So because you are lukewarm and neither hot nor cold, I will spit you out of my mouth. Now notice what they say. For you say, I am rich, I have prospered. And I need nothing, not realizing that you are wretched, pitiable, poor, blind, and naked. What did they say? They said on wealthy, but what were they they were poor. He goes on to say I counsel you to buy from from Me gold refined by fire so that you may be rich and white garments so that you may clothe yourself and the shame of your nakedness may not be seen in South or anoint your eyes so that you may see how many people are walking around in spiritual poverty without a relationship with God, yet they think that they have everything that they need. How many Christians are like those in Laodicea that have gotten comfortable and say I'm wealthy, I'm prosperous. I say I have everything that I need. How many Christians are like those at Laodicea that are neither hot nor cold or lukewarm. They're simply enjoying things, room temperature, no need to change. Does that describe any of us? Does that describe Christians at all? Poverty is a challenge in this country, even though we live in a great country of prosperity. And it's something that we need to be aware of. As I mentioned, that culture seeps in it kind of pervades, doesn't it? We see it in the media and shows and every everything around us. That's what we see. But let me suggest to you that we can be a shining light in a prosperous country by looking and acting differently than everyone else. When everyone else is consumed with with the things of life and the stuff, we can look different. I meant to bring this up in the introduction as well. But with all of that prosperity, do you think that our country is the happiest? We should be right? If you think that prosperity leads to happiness, but that's not the case. Many people see a dissatisfaction, depression of bounds. There are people that are simply dissatisfied. And there's that realization that wealth does not equal happiness, it does not give us everything that we need. And so we can, we need to understand that. We need to understand that we can be a shining light of what is important and good and valuable in this country. So the first thing we need to do is be content. As all the world is seeking the newest and the latest and unhappy about what they have and looking for more and more and more. We need to follow the advice of Hebrews 13 and five that says Keep your life free from love of money, and be content with what you have. For he has said I will never leave you nor forsake you. Be content, appreciate. Be thankful. Make lists of what you have, and thank God instead of making lists of what you don't have and what you want. Appreciate what you have and be content, be content. Not only that, but we should practice generosity. In Ephesians four verse 28. It says, Let the thief steal no longer but rather let him labor, doing honest work with his hands so that he may have something to share with anyone in need. Let us practice generosity. Let us be known for our generosity and not our stinginess. In Proverbs 19, in verse seven, it says, Whoever is generous to the poor lends to the Lord, and he will repay him for his deed. God wants us to be generous people. And I hope that describes us. Now, not only do we need to be generous, but we need to be thankful. In First Thessalonians five, verse 18, it says, Give thanks in all circumstances, for this as the will of God in Christ Jesus for you. That's another verse that stops us in our tracks, give thanks in all circumstances, we need to give thanks and prosperity. Again, I don't want to say that it's a curse,

Jeremy Sweets  31:07
to have the blessings we have in this country. But Satan's wanting to turn it into a curse. So we have to be careful about that. It is something that God has given us, but what we need to do is give thanks, and be thankful, in all circumstances, in prosperity, and maybe when we lose some of our prosperity, in health and sickness, in good times, and bad, I know we talked about that in marriage, but we need to be thankful in all of those circumstances as well. So be a thankful people. In Colossians, three, in verse 15, it says, And let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts to which indeed you were called into one body, and be thankful. I love that verse because it talks about a peace that we have, because of our relationship with God that just dwells there. There's a contentment, a peace, a satisfaction. Now, when all the world is dissatisfied, and wanting more and more and consumed with all of these things, they should be able to see within us a piece that resides the peace of Christ. And he continues and says, And be thankful, and be thankful. Related to that we need to live with purpose. Our lives do not consist in the abundance of things that we have, or in the number of shows that we can watch, or the number of tech gadgets that we have in our pockets. life does not consist of those things. So what is life about? Well, it's not about seeking our pleasure seeking our wants and our desires, as I mentioned, that actually will make us miserable, the more we try to please ourselves, the less satisfied we are. So what should we do, we should seek first God's kingdom and his righteousness. That is the purpose we need to find in this life. And that will give us a peace that will give us a contentment. As long as we're focused on what we need to be focused on. So much of this lesson really is about focus, isn't it? As we go out into the world, we begin to lose our focus, we look around and we see everything that's going on. And we need to be reminded over and over and over again, focus on what is true and right and good and important. Seek first the kingdom of God. We need to ask ourselves, maybe even daily, am I seeking first the kingdom of God? And what can I do to seek first God's kingdom? How can I make that my goal and my aim? So let us evaluate our own lives. But not only that, but we need to trust in the Lord. And a place that talks about self reliance and, and making it on your own. We need to remind others that what we have is a blessing from God. And not because we are so great, but because our God is so good. And we need to trust in him in good times and bad. We need to trust in Him. As it says in Proverbs three, verses five and six with all your hearts and do not lean on your own understanding. In all your ways acknowledge Him and He will make straight your pass. Trust in the Lord with everything that is in your being with everything that makes you up with your entire heart. God demands and asked for nothing less. He wants us to give him everything. He'll not be satisfied with a partial heart. He wants all of it. Fear here this morning and you're not a Christian. I want you to think about what this life is about. Have you found that life is fulfilled in doing what you want, is it fulfilled and sin and just making yourself happy. I think you'll find that that's not what truly makes you happy and content that is not what gives you fulfillment. The Bible teaches that sin is something that will lead to death and destruction. And we have a way to remedy that. And again, it's not by our own doing, but it's by what God has done for us by sending your son Jesus Christ to die on the cross for our sins. And we need to believe that Jesus is the Christ, repent of our sins and turn away from them confessing

Jeremy Sweets  35:34
that Jesus is the Christ, and being baptized in the water for the forgiveness of our sins. Once we do that, we are committing our entire lives and our entire being, I will serve you with all that I have all the days of my life. If you're a Christian, you need to take seriously this challenge and the challenges of the prosperity that we have. You need to ask yourself, Am I living for God? Now if you're not honoring your commitment and you're following after sin, then you need to make changes today. I know this congregation be happy to pray with you and for you, you can come forward as we sing the invitation song and ask for prayers or it may be you want to reach out to a brother or a sister afterward and say I need your prayers. Either way, don't leave a bad situation untended. If you're in sin or falling away from the Lord, then seek to do what is right and remedy to that. There's any subject to the invitation please come as we stand in saying at this time
