Team at Hebron with Absalom went 200 men from Jerusalem who were invited guests. And they went in their innocence and knew nothing. And while Absalom was offering the sacrifices he sent for a hit the Phil to get the gilsonite, David's counselor from his city, Gillo. And the conspiracy grew strong and the people with Absalom kept increasing. We see for the rest of chapter 15, that David is fleeing. Absolutely, David finds out what his son is doing. And so he flees Jerusalem. And I want to pick up the story turned over to chapter 16, beginning in verse 15, I want to pick up here, we pick up back with Absalom, in Jerusalem. Now Absalom and all the people, the men of Israel came to Jerusalem, and hit the fell with him. And when who shot the archive, David's friend came to Absalom who Shai said to Absalom, long live the king Long live the king. And Absalom said, Who shot is this your loyalty to your friend? Why did you not go with your friend and who shot said to Absalom know for whom the Lord and this people and all the men of Israel have chosen his I will be and with him I will remain and again whom should I serve? Should it not be his son, as I have served your father, so I will serve you? Verse 20. Then Absalom said to hit the fell, give your counsel What shall we do? It hit the bell said to Absalom go in your father's concubines whom him has left to keep the house and all Israel or hear that you have made yourself a stench to your father, and the hands of all who are with you will be strengthened. So they pitched a tent for Absalom on the roof. And Absalom went into his father's concubines in the sight of all Israel. Verse 23, listen carefully. Now in those days, the council that Ahithophel gave, was as if one consulted the Word of God. So was all the counsel of Ahithophel esteemed both by David and my epsilon. Hit the Phil was a trusted adviser to David. David is not a stupid man. He is one of the wisest men and all of Israel. He is a friend to God. He has said to seek after God's own heart. I think it stands to reason that if David chose a man to be his advisor, you can bet that that man is godly and wise. He was considered to be a godly and wise man, as the text says here in verse 23. But something wasn't right. Because Absalom knew that when he began to organize his plot against his father, he knew who he could call. So he set first for Hitsville. Look back and 15 Verse 12. I'll remind you and while Absalom was offering the sacrifices he sent for a hit to fill the Gil and I David's counselor, so he said word all the way to hit the Phil's hometown. It wasn't like he was standing next to him. He took effort. He consulted in search for hit the Phil. He wanted his guidance on how to best destroy David because he knew that it hit the fell knew David intimately. Not only did he trust his judgment, because of his wisdom, he knew that it hit the fellow was close to David. But the surprising thing I think is that we see a hit the fill is revealed to have a deep seated hatred for David. We see that I think in his response, look back in chapter 1621. Go into your father's concubines whom he has left to keep the house and all of Israel we're here that you have made yourself a stench to your father. How could a man who is a man of God wise, considered to speak as if you were speaking of God? Say something like this?

Unknown Speaker  04:14
Think we find the answer, although you may have to search for it. Second Samuel don't want to read this. But second Samuel 23 In verse 34 tells us that a hit the fail is the father of Allium. I'll turn it over to Second Samuel chapter 11. Verse two says it happened Late one afternoon when David arose from his couch and was walking on the roof of the king's house that he saw from the roof, a woman bathing and the woman was very beautiful. And David sent and inquired about the woman and one said, Is not this Bathsheba the daughter of Valium? The wife of Uriah the Hittite. So I think we found our answer. This is 10 years earlier that David commits his sin with Bathsheba. So for 10 years, a hit that Phil has been thinking about, and stewing on the fact that David did this thing to his granddaughter. And whether or not he was truly loyal to David, I don't know that we can tell directly from the scriptures. But it seems to be a reasonable assumption that a hit the Phil was plotting, and biding his time until opportunity presented itself some 10 years later. This is a classic example of what bitterness can do in our lives. And I won't ask you to tell me but I want you to consider tonight. Are you bitter? Do you have bitterness in your life? Is it something that has grown within you? Is it changing the way you think? Is it changing the way you act? When Jeremy asked me what I was speaking on tonight, and I told him bitterness, I thought he would have a pretty hard time finding songs to go along with that. But he I think he did a pretty good job because he chose two songs that deal with the condition of our heart. And at its root, that's what bitterness is. It's a heart issue. So tonight, I want to talk about the root of bitterness. And so we're going to start with a hit the fell and we went over some of these things. So I'm going to skip through this.

Unknown Speaker  06:35
So let's talk about its seed. How Where does it start? So I think if you look at the example that I mentioned at the top of the hour with,

Unknown Speaker  06:51
with Benedict Arnold, and maybe this is something that you would say is common among all people. I think it can start the seed of bitterness can be some perceived wrongdoing or misfortune. Whether or not that means we have some false view of reality. I think that's probably the case with Benedict Arnold, you know, he certainly had unrealistic expectations. He was expecting to be paid all of these wages. When he was a part of a nation that was broke, they had just spent seven years at the end of the war, doing battle with one of the greatest nations on earth. There was no money. And so he had unrealistic expectations that he would be paid for that. Maybe more commonly, though, is misunderstandings. How many times have you gone or know of someone who's gone years and years and years, being angry or upset with someone because of something they said or did only later to find out that that it was just a misunderstanding? They misheard what they said, they took what they said out of context, the action that was taken against them was not meant in the way that it was taken. And so we can spend years of our lives allowing bitterness to eat away at us from the inside, because of some perceived wrongdoing. And then obviously, actual wrongdoing or misfortune. Maybe even just as common is other people actually doing something to harm us. Or saying something bad about us, either to our face or behind our back slandering us. I hear pretty often, especially from people in the world who would maybe profess a at least acknowledge God. When something bad happens to them, they lose a loved one a child, a parent, a sibling, a relationship. They blame God, they're bitter toward God. Because they place the blame on him. Not only the loss of loved ones, but just, frankly, a bad, hard life. We all know people who have a difficult life and they end up blaming God for their circumstances. We lose our job, we lose our house to a fire over the last five or six years, it seems like there have been wildfires in the western part of the United States every summer. And they've been bad. They've been deadly. There have been hurricanes, tornadoes, people have lost their lives there have been flooding, all of these things and I hope that we as God's people recognize that we are still blessed even though those things happen but some people and even us we can blame God we can become bitter toward God. And I think it was the case with the hit the fell that we hide that bitterness Well, I don't think many people are going around Talking about how bad the bitterness in their heart is right? Most people are hiding it. They're they're waiting and they're they're trying to keep it inward. They're trying to allow it to be something that they deal with on their own. Maybe they've deceived themselves into thinking that it's just this minor little thing that as long as they don't act on it, it's not an issue. But that's certainly not the case. So that's it. See, that's how it starts. How does it grow within us? What's its root? I think one way that it can grow within us as jealousy turnover to James chapter three. James chapter three, beginning verse 13, says but exhort one another every day, as long as it is called today that none of you may be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin. For we have come to share in Christ if indeed we hold our original conference confidence firm to the end. As it is said today, if you hear his voice do not harden your hearts is in the rebellion. Oh, I'm sorry. I mean, Hebrews, get there. James, chapter three, let's try this again. Who was was and understanding among you, by his good conduct, let him show his works in the maintenance of wisdom. But if you have bitter jealousy and selfish ambition in your hearts, do not boast and be false to the truth. This is not the wisdom that comes down from above but as earthly unspiritual demonic for where jealousy and selfish ambition exist, there will be disorder and every vile practice.

Unknown Speaker  11:52
So this passage, I think, tells us that selfish ambition is the antithesis of Godly wisdom, from jealousy from vile corruption can only come disorder and corruption. If we allow jealousy to take root in our heart, it is going to have an effect on the way we think the way we act. And the things that we do. In addition to jealousy, many times jealousy can develop into hatred, but I think it also can stand alone, we can have hatred for someone. I won't read it again. But in Second Samuel 1621 through 23, we see the example of a hit fulfill that he let this thing that David did consume him. What as I mentioned, for 10 years, can you imagine thinking about some evil that was done to you for 10 years. 10 years is a long time. Bitterness can do a lot of damage, and just a few weeks or just a few months, if we allow it to go unchecked. And we see in the life of Ahithophel, what it can do if it goes unchecked. For 10 years, it was such a deep hatred that it consumed him. He wanted only to harm David, and not only to harm him, because we see later in that text that he does recommend that they overtake him and essentially murder him. And he requests that he do it on his own. But here's a fella wanted to disgrace David first. He wanted the people of Jerusalem to know what had been done to him. So there was this deep seated, deep rooted hatred that had grown. That's one way that bitterness grows. And then I think the next step would be malice. We've talked about some of these things in our Bible classes over the last few weeks and months. And I suppose all this year as we've talked about different heart issues, but hatred, left unchecked in our hearts leads us to desire, suffering and destruction. For those who are the subject of our bitterness and our hatred. Titus chapter three turned with me there, and I'll try to read the right versus time. Titus chapter three, beginning in verse three. For we ourselves were once foolish, disobedient, led astray, slaves to various passions and pleasures, passing our days and malice and envy, hated by others and hating one another. What a terrible way to live. Verse four says, but when the God when the goodness and loving kindness of God our Savior appeared, He saved us, not because of works done by us are in righteousness, but according to his own mercy, by the washing of regeneration and renewal of the Holy Spirit, whom he poured out on us richly through Jesus Christ, ours savior, so that being justified by his grace, we might become heirs according to the hope of eternal life. Hatred and malice enslave us and they prevent the mind of Christ from developing within us. We see from this passage what can happen when we are able to remove that hatred and that malice, that jealousy from our lives, we can then come to have the mind of Christ. And it's because of his love for us that that's possible. So, we see that hatred begins with some perceived wrongdoing, some actual wrongdoing, we allow that wrongdoing to bounce around in our mind and develop into jealousy into hatred, into malice. What is the fruit of bitterness? The fruit of bitterness as we just saw is sin. Corrupted minds result in corrupted actions. If we allow our hearts to be filled with hatred and malice and bitterness, our actions are going to be the result of that they're going to be sinful. Look with me at Luke chapter six.

Unknown Speaker  16:27
Luke chapter six, beginning in verse 43. Four No good tree bears bad fruit. Nor again does a bad tree bear good fruit. For each tree is known by its own fruit. For figs are not gathered from thorn bushes, nor are grapes picked from a bramble bush, the good person out of the good treasure of his heart produces good and the evil person out of the evil treasure produces evil. For out of the abundance of the heart his mouth speaks. I think it's obvious to us from scripture from this passage and from others, that our actions are an outpouring of what's in our heart. If we allow our heart to be corrupted, our actions are going to be corrupted sin is going to be produced, but also ruin it sin if the threat of sin being produced by you is not enough to deter you from cleansing your heart from rooting out and digging out these corrupt things that can take hold, then maybe ruin will be enough. Hebrews 12 This time will actually be in Hebrews, Hebrews chapter 12. Verse 14, and 15. Strive for peace with everyone and for the holiness without which no one will see the Lord. See to it that no one fails to obtain the grace of God, that no root of bitterness springs up and causes trouble. And by it many have come have become defiled. Bitterness has been the downfall of many people throughout history. We see examples of that throughout the text, we see examples of it in history, we see examples of it in our own lives. Bitterness does not stop at just being something that that we can deal with in our hearts and we can take care of it. No, it produces sin and it produces ruin. Back in our text, and Second Samuel want to turn back there one more time. Before we spend the balance of our time talking about how we overcome bitterness, Second Samuel chapter 17.

Unknown Speaker  18:50
Look at verse 23. This is after all of the things that the hit the Phil had recommended have been tried. Absalom does go on to the roof and have relations with all of those khaki bonds and he does bring disgrace to David's name. But when they try to find David to kill him, the guys that they send to find David kind of give it a half hearted effort and then they give up and turn around and go home. Verse 23 of chapter 17. And when I hit the fell, saw that his counsel was not followed. He saddled his donkey went off home to his own city. He set his house in order and hanged himself. And he died and was buried in the tomb of his father. So hit the Phil had spent 10 years of his life thinking about what he would do today. But if he had ever if he was ever given the chance, and he's given that opportunity and he acts on it, and when it doesn't go the way he expects he is so overcome with failure with defeat, probably still with bitterness that he sees no other way but to end his own life. And sadly, that is the result of Many of many people today many people today allow bitterness to overtake them. And they spend years thinking about it. And maybe they don't act on it the way hit the Phil did, but it ends in suicide. And that's, that's very sad. But unfortunately that is the result. So with those outcomes in mind, I hope we're enlightened to what bitterness can do. In our lives. It's not an innocent feeling that we can simply hide from others or from God. It's not a harmless attitude that will pass with time. It is a deadly route that grows into corruption, and sin and destruction. So how do we overcome? How do we overcome bitterness, I think there are probably a lot of things that we can do. But I've selected just for tonight, the first thing I think we can do is we can acknowledge our own sin and remember the grace of God, I want to look at a couple passages that teach this principle. Romans chapter three. Romans chapter three, beginning of verse 21, says, but now the righteousness of God has been manifested apart from the law, although the law and the prophets bear witness to it, the unrighteousness of the righteousness of God through faith in Jesus Christ, for all who believe, for there is no distinction, For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, and are justified by his grace as a gift through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus, we all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, when we can acknowledge our sin, and remember that we too are guilty of sin toward God, foremost, but also toward our fellow men, whether it be our brethren in Christ, whether it be people in the world, we sin against people. And there's probably a high likelihood that there is someone out there who is bitter toward you, that you have said or done something, whether it was intentional or not in their life, they, maybe they have some bitterness towards you, maybe they hate you because of something you said or did in your past. And maybe you don't even remember it. But when you put it in that context, and remember that I too, have sinned, All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, yet, we have that glory, we have been given grace, when we can put it in that context, I think it's going to help us to overcome look at first John as well. First John chapter one. I want to read through the end of the chapter, this is the message we have heard from him and proclaim to you that God is light and in him is no darkness at all. If we say we have fellowship with Him, while we walk in darkness, we lie and do not practice truth. But if we walk in the light as He is in the light, we have fellowship with one with another, and the blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us from all sin. If we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us. If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness we say we have not sinned, we make Him a liar, and His word is not in us.

Unknown Speaker  23:28
In just a minute, we're going to talk about forgiveness. But I think this passage hints at that. If we know that we are guilty of sin, that we sinned against God, that we sin against other people, that we should be willing to go to those people to go to God foremost and confess those sins. But if we have done something wrong against our brother, we should also be willing to go to them and ask for forgiveness. And many times that will go a long way into pulling out that root of bitterness. We can acknowledge our own sin, we can also walk in the Spirit Galatians chapter five, we know this passage well. But I want to back up and read what comes before the fruit of the Spirit. Galatians chapter five beginning of verse 16, but I say walk by the Spirit, and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh. For the desires of the flesh are against the spirit and the desires of the spirit or against the flesh. For these are opposed to each other, to keep you from doing the things you want to do. But if you are led by the Spirit, you are not under the law. Now the works of the flesh are evident sexual immorality, impurity, sensuality, idolatry, sorcery, enmities, strife, jealousy fits of anger, rival rivalries, dissensions, divisions, envy, drunkenness, orgies, and things like these. I warn you as well. Weren't you before that those who do such things will not inherit the kingdom of God. We have to walk in the Spirit. We know what comes after this. The fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self control. Against such things, there is no law. But these things cannot exist with the things that are mentioned in verse 20, and 21. They're not compatible. We must put away all desires of the flesh. If we have any hope of walking in the spirit of being pleasing to God, we have to cleanse our hearts, and we have to walk in the Spirit. We have to forgive Ephesians, 431 and 32. I've spent a lot of time in Ephesians. This year I taught a class in the back on Ephesians. And my Sunday morning. class was was loosely based on passages in Ephesians. But I think these passages really speak to us about our heart issues. Let's read verse 31, and 32 of visions, chapter four. Let all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and slander be put away from you, along with all malice. Be kind to one another, tender hearted, forgiving one another, as God and Christ forgave you. So Ephesians chapter four, if you remember, gives us something that we should not be doing something that we should put away. And then it tells us something we should put on. And then it tells us why. And so what is the why here in verse 32, as God in Christ forgave you, if we if we want to have any hope of of overcoming bitterness or hatred toward a brother or another, we have to be willing to forgive them. And the only way I think that we can forgive someone, especially if it's some wrong that has actually been done some some real wrongdoing that we have been the victim of, is we have to remember that God through Christ forgave us. The sin that we have committed against God is greater than any sin that any other man can commit against us. Those things are petty in comparison. So we have to be willing to forgive as we look to the example of God through Christ. And finally, one last passage, we have to be on guard. And I have Hebrews 12 up here, but I want to read instead of Proverbs chapter four, turn with me to Proverbs chapter four, and what let's read 23 through 27.

Unknown Speaker  27:40
This section of verses I think, does a pretty good job of describing exactly what steps need to be taken if we want to guard our hearts. Keep your heart with all vigilance. For from it flow the springs of life, put away from you crooked speech, and put devious talk from far from you. Let your eyes look directly forward and your gaze be straight before you ponder the path of your feet, then all your ways will be sure do not swerve to the right or to the left, turn your foot away from evil. So this one short section of verses tells us that we need to be careful what we say, be careful what we look at, be careful what we think, be careful where we go. Those are the ways that we guard our heart. And if we want to keep from allowing bitterness and hatred in any other sin of the heart, for that matter, from taking root within us, we have to guard against it. We have to recognize that we are susceptible to sin to temptation to be bitter. That just because we are in general, a loving person, maybe we we tend to get along with people. You don't know what you're capable of until you're put in the situation. And when circumstances arise that would force most people to be bitter, to be hateful to have spied in their heart. You too are susceptible to that and I am as well. So I want as we asked at the beginning of my lesson, I want you to ask yourself, are you bitter? Your brother and likely don't know if you are unless you've talked to someone about it. So if you haven't talked to somebody about it, ask for their prayers to help you overcome. Have you forgiven your brother? If there's some wrong that's been done to you, Have you forgiven that person and I want to remind you that forgiveness does not have to be asked for you can forgive someone whether or not they deserve it or they've asked for it or they even know that you've forgiven them. Sometimes people hold grudges even far past the death of the person that they're holding that grudge against. They might be bitter until they go to their own grave. So forgive whether or not the person knows but but tell them forgive them and tell them that you've Forgive them. Do you need prayers of the congregation to help you overcome bitterness or some other heart issue in your life? Are you a Christian? If not, you have an opportunity. Now we're getting ready to sing another song that has to do with our heart. So think about the condition of your heart tonight. Is there some heart issue that has corrupted your heart? Are you not a child of God and you know that you need to become one. Once you come forward now as we stand and sing this song, that invitation
