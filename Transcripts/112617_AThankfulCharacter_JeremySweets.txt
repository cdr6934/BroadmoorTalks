Good morning. It's good to see everyone here today. It's certainly a beautiful day to be able to worship our God. Appreciate Trevor songs and see prepared our minds for the fact that we are assembling here together that we are assembling to praise and worship our God. So I'm glad that you're here with us this morning. I'm glad that I can be here in this assembly so that we can worship God. When I was a child, it was not uncommon for my parents to force me to show gratitude. Go and tell this person, thank you. And if we were at somebody's house, or receiving some kind of blessing like that, it usually wasn't a problem. There were times on Christmas, though, when I was forced to say thank you. And I wasn't really that thankful. I was probably seven or eight years old. And I remember getting an unopened present from my grandmother, and saying, I hope this isn't close. I had all the clothes I needed, I had never experienced a time without clothes. So I took that for granted. I wanted to toy. My my grandmother worked at a clothing factory. You know, thinking back on that I feel horrible about that. I didn't think a thing about it at the time, my mom forced me to say thank you, and to show gratitude.

Jeremy Sweets  01:38
You know, as parents, we want our children to show gratitude, but we really want them to say more than the words. If I were to say thank you, my parents would stop and correct me. That's not the right way to say that. Being thankful is more than simply having words come out of your mouth. Being thankful really is is a character that we developed. Being thankful really is more than an individual thing as much as it is a package of our character. This year, we've been talking about Kingdom citizens, and within that we focused on character. And so as I thought about being thankful, as we've been focused on Thanksgiving, as a nation as past few days, I thought it'd be helpful to think about our thankful character. There's really much that is wrapped up within this idea of having a thankful character. One person I saw online, altered the words to say instead of Thanksgiving, thanks, living. I think that carries the idea that we're talking about here today. This really is a lifestyle. It's something we do more than than once a once a year, something we do more than on occasion if we simply utter some words, but it really is a lifestyle. It really is character that should come from our heart and who we are. And as Christians, this is a characteristic that defines who we are. It should be what we are about. In First Thessalonians 518 It says Give thanks in all circumstances, for this as the will of God and Christ Jesus for you at all times, it is to be a part of it is to be the essence of our life. It is to be our character. It has to be our character. As a flower has roots and produces a fruit or a flower or something that comes from it. I think Thankfulness is the same way our character provides the roots that will produce thankfulness. And so let us focus for a few moments this morning on having a thankful character, a thankful character. So first of all, let me simply define a thankful character and I've picked out three or four characteristics that really go within or alongside Thanksgiving and being thankful. Okay, so we're looking at some characteristics that's part of this package. First of all, there is humility, humility. Thankfulness begins with our fundamental orientation to God, recognizing God and who he is, and really are placed within him. It's hard to be thankful and be prideful at the same time. Thankful necessitates thankfulness necessitates humility, and Ephesians two verses eight and nine when you realize that salvation is a gift that we could not provide for ourselves. There it says For by grace, you have been saved through faith and this is not your own doing it is the gift of God, not as a result of work so that no one may boast. We're so quick, aren't we? To think that what I have comes from my hard work, from the bootstraps and all, everything relies upon what I can do. That's simply not true is we owe God. So much everything we have comes from God. And you see how that humility relates to Thanksgiving. If I stand in pride before God, and before others, I'm not going to be thankful, I'm gonna pat myself on the back, I'm going to say why I deserve this. It's owed to me, because of my hard work, because of who I am because of my greatness because of my glory. But humility demands that we would lower ourself and recognize that we should be thankful for what God has given to us. In First Corinthians, chapter four, Paul was instructing the Christians about avoiding factions and divisions, and verses six and seven, he says, I have applied all these things to myself and apologize for your benefit brothers, that you may learn by us not to go beyond what is written, that none of you may be puffed up in favor of one against another, for who sees anything different in you, what do you have that you did not receive it, then you received it? Why do you boast as if you did not receive it?

Jeremy Sweets  06:29
Let me underscore one of those last questions that Paul asked. He asked this, what do you have, that you did not receive? Now Paul is talking in reference here to the gospel, but I think we can make a broader application and ask the question ourselves, what do we have, that we did not receive? What really can we look to ourselves and say, This is all because of me. Humility demands that we recognize that God has given us all things, He is the giver of every good and perfect gift. And so what do we have? That God has not given to us? What do we have, that others have not helped us with? What do we have that we have not been benefited from another? Humility recognizes that we have nothing that we did not receive. And thankfulness refuses to boast and self, but recognizes what we have is what we have received. So if we're going to talk about a thankful character, I think we need to understand we need humility. That's part of that package. Okay? We also need contentment, contentment, contentment is a necessary ingredient of a thankful character. And I know we had Thanksgiving but I realized, even though this is the Sunday after there's there still need to talk about thankfulness isn't there. In fact, we immediately moved from Thanksgiving to buying as much as we can possibly get. Cyber weekend and Black Friday, and sales. There's nothing wrong with purchasing things. But we have to have the proper attitude toward things. And in this country, it is so dangerous. It is so easy to fall into the trap of material was. And we lose our thankfulness, don't we? We need to be content. Paul says in First Timothy six verses seven and eight, For we brought nothing into the world and we cannot take anything out of the world. But if we have food and clothing with these, we will be content. Now there's a few things you've never seen one of those as you've never seen a U haul behind the hearse have you. We can't take anything from this life with us. Yet we spend so much of our energy and our time stockpiling things that require our time and attention, abundance of things most of that we don't even want our life we simply store it up for maybe someday we'll use it later. And we still have the attitude I still can't get enough. I still can't get enough. Can we make the statement that Paul made? This is a challenge. If we have food and clothing with these, we will be content. Now honestly ask yourself that question. Paul learned that he was to have contentment in all circumstances. In Philippians, four verses 10 through 13. He says Not that I'm speaking of being a need for I have learned in whatever situation I am in to be content. I know how to be brought low and I know how to bound in any and every circumstance, I have learned the secret of facing plenty and hunger, abundance in need. I can do all things through Him who strengthens me. When we quote that last passage a lot in the world quotes that a lot. I think sometimes it's taken out of context, I can do all things, we simply stop there. And you know, if I want to be a pro football player or whatever, whatever goal I want, you know, I can do that I can do everything in Christ. But what is the everything that Paul is talking about? Paul is saying, I can do all things or everything. And that means that I can be both without and be content. And I can learn to have an abundance and be content. You know, I think we will be hard pressed in both of those situations. What if we were lacking? Could we be content in that situation? Can we find contentment in God and in Christ and what we do have? The other situation that he describes as equally difficult, isn't it? Can we be content in an abundance? When we have more that we need, which I think would describe most everyone here can we be content in the problem is when we get a little we want more and more and more. And so contentment is needed if we are to have a thankful character, a thankful character.

Jeremy Sweets  11:31
Let us also that we need generosity, generosity, this goes hand in hand with contentment, and, and really humility. Faithfulness translates into generosity. When we recognize God for what He has given to us, when we are content with the necessities of life and what we have, we will be eager and willing to give to others. When we realize what God has given to us or that God has given all things to us, we can't help but extend those blessings on to others. And in that way, we become not only recipients of God's blessings, but also channels for God's blessings to others. We are paying it forward, we are giving what we have been given. You know, the discontented. The greedy and the ungrateful can only focus on themselves, and what more they need. They have blinders on, don't they? They can't see outside themselves, I need more. And if I only had this, I would be happy. But the thankful take the blinders off and realize that God has given us all things and we need to extend out. We need to extend out. My security doesn't depend on all those things. Notice how thankfulness and generosity go hand in hand in the Old Testament in Deuteronomy chapter 15. One of the law says that if your brother or Hebrew man or Hebrew woman is sold to you, he shall serve six years and in the seventh year you shall let him go free from you. And when you let him go free from You shall not let him go empty handed. You shall furnish him liberally out of your flock out of your flush threshing floor and out of your wine press. As the Lord your God has blessed you, you shall give to him, You shall remember that you were a slave in the land of Egypt, and the Lord your God redeemed you therefore I command you this today. Notice there toward the end of that passage, as the Lord your God has blessed you. So bless others. Thankful people will extend the blessings of God to other people. faithful people will recognize what they had been given in the situation and the circumstances from which they had been delivered, and provided blessings in difficult times. And they will extend that out. God says you should remember that you were a slave. You should remember what has been done for you, and you will do for others. In First Timothy, verse, chapter six, verses seven and nine, we see that the rich are encouraged to be generous. So Paul says, As for the rich in his present age, charged them not to be haughty, not to set their hopes on the uncertainty of riches, but on God, who richly provides us with everything to enjoy. They are to do good, to be rich in good works, to be generous and ready to share. Thus storing up treasure for themselves is a good foundation for the future. So that they may take hold of that which is true in life. You know what the world considers wealth don't you? So those that that are rich in money. The world considers wealth those that have a treasure house or storehouse in the bank, or in the stock market. But God sees wealth differently. God sees richness differently. It's not those that are rich in money that are rich in God's sight, but are those that are rich in good works, and doing what is good, it is not those that have a stockpile in the stock market or in the bank, that are wealthy in God's sight, but those that have a treasure that is stored up in heaven, and that functions as a good foundation for the future. You see, God in the world defined wealth in different ways. So are we striving to be which rich according to the world standards are according to God's. And he's here talking about those that are rich in this present age. Those that have been given an abundance should focus their attention, not so much on their money, not so much on the uncertainty of their money, but on God, and on being rich and good works, being generous and ready to share. And then being those that, that store up a treasure in heaven for themselves.

Jeremy Sweets  16:31
So we see that generosity goes hand in hand with thankfulness. Those that are thankful look outside themselves and seek to be generous, seek to give an abundance God has given them much and they seek to be generous in their giving. But those that are ungrateful, simply close their eyes and put their arms around what they have and say mine, mine mine. That's a quote from the minus sore. If you've read children's books, which I do every night, we also see that joy, joy is part of the thankful character. And Psalm 97, in verse 12, it says, Rejoice in the Lord, are you righteous and give thanks to his holy name. The joyful person focuses on the blessings that they have. They're thankful for the blessings. Each and every one, the joyful person thinks about the positive things that God has given them. And that's where their mind dwells. That's where their mind stays, it's on what God has given them. They allow their faith in their hope to provide stability and provide a safe passage through the storms of life, and through difficulties of life. And so they have the same problems that anybody else would have been the joyful chooses to focus their mind on what is good. They choose to focus their mind on what God has given them. The negative person, the ungrateful person is the exact opposite. They could have every blessing in the world. And yet one thing is not to their liking, and what are they going to focus on? What do I focus on for too often? What do we focus on? It's that negative thing? We steal our own joy. So often, we think that joy depends upon circumstances, having the right things in life, if I only had this, if I had this toy, if I had this electronic, if I had had this thing, I would be happy if I only had the right job if I only had, you know, a family that didn't bug me so much if I only had this and this and this in this and we go down the line. But that's that's really not the key to joy at all, isn't it? It's really where we choose to focus our minds. And again, I say that is a challenge. That is a challenge. But it is a choice. It is a choice. And we need to be those that choose to be joyful. Now some of us are more joyful than others. Some of this, this is more of a challenge than others. But I would suggest that that you can control at least the direction in which you're going. You can choose to focus on what is good and what is right. And you can become more and more joyful. Even if you don't describe yourself as simply a joyful person we can find joy in God, but it will require our devotion or require our effort it will require a focused attention upon God and what He has done. So as we Need to find a thankful character. There are many things we could put in this list. But I think we have to uncute includes humility, contentment, generosity and joy. So how can we develop a thankful character? How can we develop a thankful character? First of all, we have to recognize God. Humility is a starting place for being thankful. And if we are to be thankful, we have to truly recognize God, we have to become a Christian submit our life to Him. Proverbs one seven says, the fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge, a knowledge of God and a fear and a respect of Him and who he is, is the beginning of what we know. And really, that extends to who we are. A fear and a knowledge of God is the foundation of our character. And if you want to have a thankful character, you're going to have to recognize God

Jeremy Sweets  20:57
as the giver, you're going to have to recognize God as the one in control. And so let us first recognize God if we are to truly develop, I think, full character. Let us read Scripture. In Psalm 119, verse 11, the psalmist said he has hid God's Word and His heart treasured it up, stored it up in his heart. In verse 103, says God's word is sweeter than honey. And he longs for it. In verse 70, and 174, he says, he delights in the law of the Lord. The Psalmist doesn't discount God's word but, but seeks it rejoices in it, spends time in it. He reads scripture and he puts it in his heart. We need to do the same thing today if we are to be thankful. We have to understand that God's Word is living and active. And we have challenges first world problems, all oftentimes of, of materialism and many things in this life. But God's word can bend and shape us according to His will. You remember First Thessalonians 518 where we started, we are to give thanks in all circumstances, for this is God's will for you. That is what God wants for you. And God's word can bend us and shape us in that way. So let us read scripture, fill our hearts with this. Let us reflect. Let us reflect upon God's Word. Let us reflect upon our blessings. Let us pause in the busyness of life and reflect in Psalm 63, verses five and six, he says my soul will be satisfied with fat and rich food. And my mouth will praise you with joyful lips, when I remember you upon my bed and meditate on you and the watches of the night. Sometimes we just simply do not take the time to be still. And that prevents us from being thankful. Because we don't slow down enough. We don't stop enough to think about everything that we had, and where that comes from. And to think about God and His Word, we need to slow down. We need to reflect, we need to meditate. We need to take time to slowly chew and digest God's Word, to think about our blessings to think about what we have. We need to be a people that that reflects that reflect so does that describe you? That you have problems with being joyful? Would you describe yourself or being as thankful as you need to take more time to reflect? We also need to count our blessings. No, that's a challenge. Have you ever tried to count your blessings have what's the number you can get to? I would guess if you were even to get to 1000, which I would think all of us could do if we spent the time doing it. We would still say I didn't touch the hem of the garment. I didn't even I didn't even come close to talking about all my blessings. Let us count our blessings. James 117 says Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above. Coming down from the Father of life with whom there is no variation or shifting of shadow or shadow due to change. Everything we have comes from God and so taking the time to stop and think about what those are one by one will help us To Be thankful that will help us to put things in perspective. Remember, I said the fact that it's really a matter of our focus of our mind is whether we're going to be joyful or not. Well, if we count our blessings and realize how much we have, that's going to put things in perspective when a trial or a trouble comes our way won't. But if we fail to count our blessings, and simply count our problems, count our trials that then we're going to lose all joy, we're going to lose our thankful attitude. So let us count our blessings, count our blessings.

Jeremy Sweets  25:39
Character is important character serves is that route. But Thankfulness is something that's meant to be display. It's meant to be shown. It's not something meant to be simply stored in your heart, even though as I've mentioned several times it starts in the heart, but it's meant to come out. You know, you usually don't plant something in the ground with the intent that it's going to stay there forever. You want it to grow, you want it to produce fruit. And so it is with our thankful character. It is something that needs to be displayed. Display. We can do that. First of all in prayer. We need to be a praying people. In First Thessalonians 516 through 18. He says Rejoice always pray without ceasing. Give thanks in all circumstances, for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus for you. Pray without ceasing. Do not let there be a time in your life, where you stop praying. Do not let there be a season in your life where you stop praying, pray at all times give thanks in all circumstances, pray, pray to God and give thanks. There is not a situation in the life I believe, where thanks could not be given. Again, there are trials there are troubles. There are heartaches, and I don't want to minimize that or say they don't exist. But in every situation, we are never at the point where we are completely devoid of blessings. And so I believe we can follow this passage and give thanks in all circumstances. And we need to be a people that pray and do that regularly. Are you a person that gives thanks to God in prayer on a regular basis. We not only need to pray to Him, but we need to praise him before other people. In First Chronicles six verses seven and eight, reverse seven, after David had successfully brought the Ark back to Jerusalem. It says that he appointed that Thanksgiving be sung to the Lord by ASAP and his brothers, David took time to make sure not only personally he was praising God, but that that was part of the community. And so the first line of the recorded words of thanksgiving and verse eight say, Oh, give thanks to the Lord. call upon his name, make known his deeds among the people. Talk to God, give thanks to Him, but do that not only to him, but also to others. Do we talk about God's goodness to others? You know, sometimes we want to plan. We need these home Bible studies. And those are important and those are helpful. But at times we can reach out to others by simply having our our speech, season with solid having our speech. give praise and glory to God let that be a regular part of what we say. And we can make that a habit. And people that are searching for something will hear those words and they'll ask and no question which is what we want. We want people that are seeking. So let us praise God let us make that more a habit, a regular part of our speech that we would thank God and you know I'm blessed.

Jeremy Sweets  29:13
Ciao child is born are you know, you can go through the list of blessings. There are so many opportunities to talk about God's goodness. We don't have to hide. We don't have to be ashamed. But let us praise God to others. Let us also think others. When Jesus healed 10 Samaritan lepers one returned to give things in verses 15 and 16. Or this passage it says Then one of them when he saw that he was healed, turned back, praising God with a loud voice and he fell on his face at Jesus feet, giving him thanks. Jerry had an excellent invitation on Wednesday night talking about this passage. That's a passage we need to focus on. We need to be people that think Oh, others, there are so many people in our lives that need our thinks that that deserve our things and we should be eager and willing to give it. So the question for us is, are we the nine that I think are thankful certainly are happy for what we have? Or are we the one that's happy for what we have and then expresses that, and then gives thinks, we need to be the ones that are the one that gives thanks. So let us think others and Jerry reminded of, of several people we could do that with. And I'm sure there are many, many people we could add to the list that need our thanks. So let us be busy and displaying our thankful character. Let us also use positive words, in Ephesians four, verse 29. It says Let no corrupting talk come out of your mouths, but only such as as good for building up as fits the occasion that it may give grace to those that here, here we see there's something we're not to do and something we are to do, do not let corrupting talk. You know what that is? You've probably seen a battery that's been corroded or corrupted that has no use anymore. All it's doing is decaying. All it's doing is dying. All it's doing is causing damage. Don't let your words be like that. But let your words be edifying. Building up being productive, being good. The tech says that it may give grace to those who hear. And Ephesians five and verse four, he continues this line of thought when he says Let there be no filthiness nor foolish talk nor crew joking, which are out of place, but instead let there be Thanksgiving. You know, our language in some ways is going to be a barometer of really what's in our hearts. So what do we talk about? What do we focus on? are we complaining continually? Are we negative? Continually? Somebody says, Yeah, but this happened, you know? Yeah, but this is wrong. What, where's our focus? What is our language say, about us? Are we continually focused on negative or even sinful or dirty? Is our mind in the gutter fit? Is that's going to come out in our speech, isn't it? Or is our mind? Find for filled with a thankful character so that that's just it's coming out of us? It's coming out of us. So that we are talking about what is positive? We're thinking about and dwelling on what is positive those things in God that we have the blessings that we have? Are we positive or negative in our speech? I have to tell you, this is a difficult lesson for me because I have so much room for growth. In all of these areas, my regular speech, my heart, my thoughts, my generosity, my kindness, my lack of selfishness, my willing to serve my generosity.

Jeremy Sweets  33:15
We need to grow in this. I certainly do. I think that having a thankful character is what is demanded by God. And for Christians, for all Christians, it's part of a package isn't. Let us strive to be Kingdom citizens that are seeking to give God glory and all that we do. And that starts with our hearts and with our character. Early in the lesson, the first point we started off in developing a thankful character is becoming a Christian, dedicating your life to God recognizing who he is and your place before him. I think that's vital. That's necessary. If you're here this morning, and you're not a Christian, you have an opportunity to give your life to Him. Sin stands in our way of life and life with him. Sin brings forth death. And there's nothing we can do by ourselves about that we are dependent upon God and His grace and His mercy. And God sent his son in his mercy and grace, to die on the cross for our sins, so that we would have an opportunity to be saved. And so if you want to accept that gracious gift, and you'll believe that Jesus is the Christ, you'll repent of your sins. That means change the way you're living, turn away from sin and turn towards service. you'll confess that Jesus is the Christ and you'll be baptized in the water for the forgiveness of your sins. That's accepting what God has done for you. And there's nothing you can boast about in that. If you're here this morning and you are a Christian, and you're not living as you should then you need to make correction as well. If you want to come forward, the congregation will pray for you. If you'd like to reach out to a brother and sister after one more prayer Ideally, that would also be appropriate. But whatever it is, don't allow it to be hidden. Don't bury it. If you need to make changes reach out. We're all trying to get to heaven. That's what we're all trying to do. And so we're going to suspend judgment and seek to give you the help that you need. If there's any subject to the invitation. Please come as we stand in scene at this time.
