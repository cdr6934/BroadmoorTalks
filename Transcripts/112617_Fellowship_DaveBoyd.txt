Unknown Speaker  00:01
Well, good evening. We're wrapping up this Thanksgiving holiday weekend. I have to say it's consistently been my favorite holiday of my adult lifetime. But it's great that we have in our nation, this time where we get to commemorate blessings that we've received, we get to share a special meal together, we remind each other to be thankful. Coming together and fellowship and sharing our gifts and our blessings from God is an essential component of faithful life, of dedication in Christ. So tonight, I want to talk about fellowship, fellowship that's aligned in Christ. Fellowship as a cornerstone of our faith, it's stressed pretty heavily throughout the New Testament, the ideas of unity and harmony with God, and with his saints. And the notion that for us to serve God requires us to serve one another. But annex, chapter two, verse 42, we learned that the Christians were devoted to four things to the apostles teaching, to fell into breaking of the bread, to fellowship, and to prayer. So from the beginning of the Lord's church, these were four pillars of the Christian life, and it could be argued that fellowship could be found. And all four of these are the other three of these things. Yet fellowship itself is mentioned. Apart from the others fellowship has given its own special significance, and the New Testament. I mean, it's 1/4 of that Thanksgiving pie there. But fellowship in the New Testament, is dealt with very thoroughly. And, first, John. The basis of our fellowship is explored in First John chapter one and looking at Verse five, says, This is the message we've heard from him, and proclaim to you that God is light, and in him is no darkness at all. If we say we have fellowship with Him, while we walk in darkness, we lie and do not practice the truth. But if we walk in the light as He is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us from all sin. So the basis of our fellowship is walking in God's light, we walk with him according to his Word. First, John also deals pretty heavily with another component of the fellowship that we share under the New Testament, and that's the fellowship that we have with one another. Chapter Four, especially. In verse 11, John writes, Beloved, if God so loved us, we also ought to love one another. No one has ever seen God. If we love one another, God abides in us and his love is perfected in us. And then in verse 20, again, he says, If anyone says, I love God, and hates his brother, he is a liar. For he to who does not love his brother, whom he has seen, cannot love a god whom he has not seen. And this commandment we have from him, whoever loves God, must also love his brother. Faith is expressed to God, by the deeds by the works that we do, and in showing love to one another. Faith is a thing that we can pay up to God, we need to pay that out towards our fellow man, and especially to our brothers. But when we talk about fellowship, we talk about two models of fellowship there's the vertical A model of fellowship where this describes or helps define the relationship that each of us have.

Unknown Speaker  05:13
To God, God being in authority, he is over us above us. So we talked about the vertical fellowship. But we also have the horizontal fellowship. And that would be the fellowship that we share with one another commonly the things that we do together, whether we're coming in worship together, whether we're studying together, where we're going off to do some, some work for someone that needs a chore done, that they can't do whatever it is, we we, we have also the spiritual blessings that we share one with another. But what I want to talk about tonight, is when that vertical fellowship, the relationship that we share with God intersects on its access, on its axis with the horizontal fellowship that we share with one another. And at the point where they cross, we have fellowship, aligned in Christ. These two forms of fellowship that I'm talking about the vertical and the horizontal forms or fellowship, we can isolate them in order to study them, and understand them better, but there's no way that we can separate them. They're linked. And I want to look at a few passages in the scripture that help demonstrate this. And Matthew, chapter 22. We know the story about the time that the there was some Pharisees and one of them was a lawyer came up to Jesus with a question and he says, teacher, which is the great commandment in the wall. And he said to him, You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart with all your soul, and with all your mind. This is the, the great and first commandment. And when Jesus was answering him based on Deuteronomy, chapter six, where he that he cites there, but Jesus didn't stop there. He gave this man, another answer. And verse 39, he says, and a second is like it, you shall love your neighbor, as yourself. On these two commandments, depend all the law and the prophets. So the first and the greatest commandment, of course, is to prioritize God. We love God with all of our heart and soul, and mind, all of our strength. But Jesus gives us this second one that's like it, he's linking this other one, so that it will not be separated. He says, You shall love your neighbor as yourself. The Law and the Prophets, when you think about Moses coming down from the mountain carrying those stone tablets, the 10 commandments, the first five, it was dealt with man's reverence and love and his relationship to God. And the other five commandments dealt with the way that man is to love and revere one another. We talk about having two sides of the same coin. Well, these are two sides of the same stone tablet, man's relationship with God and man's relationship with his fellow man are connected, and especially the concern and treatment of others as a way to directive that we find into the New Testament. I'm gonna look at Matthew chapter five, briefly here for a moment. Verse 21, Jesus says, You've heard that it was said to those of old You shall not murder and whoever murderers will be liable to judgment. But I say to you, that everyone who is angry with his brother will be liable to judgment. Whoever insults his brother will be liable to the council. And whoever says You fool, will be liable to the hell of fire. So we have to think about words that we use with one another insulting words can be very serious, but think about what the product is we devalue the one that God creates. Jesus is

Unknown Speaker  10:09
elevating, being angry with your brother to murder, he's making a big point there that that's where it starts, we have to watch her temper with one another, we have to make sure that we're not going to lose the reverence that we need to have towards each other, and especially that we're not going to demean or devalue or dehumanize God's children. But it's also interesting to see in verse 23, what he continues to say. So if you are offering your gift at the altar, and there remember that your brother has something against you, leave your gift there before the altar and go, First be reconciled to your brother, and then come and offer your gift. Jesus seems to be prioritizing reconciliation over this act of worship that was going to be done. The passage that we looked at in Matthew chapter 22, the parallel account and Mark chapter 12, tells that when the warrior heard Jesus's answer, he agreed with Jesus, he said, Indeed, to love God with all the heart and all the mind all the soul, and to love one's neighbors oneself is indeed greater than whole burnt offerings. The whole burnt offering is the most costly sacrifice that anyone could ever make. And not a single part of that burned offering would go to anyone else, not even to a priest or Levite, it would all be burned up to God.

Unknown Speaker  12:00
And yet, to love God, and to love thy neighbor as yourself,

Unknown Speaker  12:07
it is said is even better than that. But if you want to remember your God, you must not forget your brother. Think about First Peter chapter three. When he says likewise, husbands, live with your wives in an understanding way, showing honor to the woman as the weaker vessel, since they are heirs with you of the grace of life, so that your prayers may not be hindered. Think about the fellowship that's shared in the home. And that's a pretty close fellowship. And sometimes it's a slippery slope, or it's thin ice or it's eggshells at times. But for the husbands, to deal with the wives they needed to remember. Peter says that they are heirs with you of the grace of life. And I think the same holds true for the rest of his Broadway that we have to remember each other. We all are to be fellow heirs of grace and to treat each other as such and and the warning was there that when we failed to do that, that our prayers can be hindered. Our relationship with God can be hindered when we don't recognize that when we act contrary to that. We have to remember that our relationship with God is not exclusive. Others share in His blessings to when we get to share them together. one more passage before us shift gears here is Matthew chapter 18. And this is the occasion where Peter comes up to Jesus and he wants to ask the question, Lord, how often will my brothers sinned against me and I forgive him? As many as seven times. Jesus said to him, I did not say to you seven times, but 77 times. So Jesus then began to tell a story about in verse 23, says, Therefore the kingdom of heaven may be compared to a king who wished to settle accounts with his servants. And he tells a story about this servant that didn't have the ability to repay his debt to the king when it was time and he was going to be thrown into prison. And he threw himself down and he begged and pleaded to the king to help him and the king forgave the debt. He forgave the debt Of course, we know the rest of the story, that same servant then went out and went up to everyone else that he knew and started to shake them down if they owed him money. And with force in with violence and threats, he began to torment them all, while the King found out about it and was pretty upset about that. And verse 32, it says, Then his master summoned him and said to him, You wicked servant, I forgave you all that debt because you pleaded with me. And should not you have had mercy on your fellow servant, as I had mercy on you. And in anger, his master delivered him to the jailers until he should pay all his debt. So also, my heavenly Father will do to every one of you if you do not forgive your brother from your heart. So a few things we can take away from this, if you won't forgive, you won't be forgiven. To receive the blessing of forgiveness from God, we must forgive each other. God's not going to share his forgiveness with us. If we don't share that forgiveness with others, we need to reflect God's grace. The Lord's Prayer when he instructed His disciples and Matthew chapter six, no we we forgive, as to be forgiven as we forgive those who trespass against us. And Jesus went on to explain further in verse 14, and 15, that we need to be forgiving, so that we may be forgiven ourselves. And also, again, in Mark chapter 11, he repeats this same information. And when you stand praying, forgive that if you have anything against anyone, so that your father also was in heaven may forgive you your trespasses.

Unknown Speaker  16:55
The vertical and horizontal fellowship are inseparable. Now faith has taught us to prioritize our lives in this way we, according to work that we do, we put God first, we'll put others second. And we put ourselves last bit in worship, can we sometimes shift these priorities around to put ourself ahead of others? Now each of us is commanded that we need to worship God. But can we do so when we put ourselves ahead of others? When we assemble for worship? Is it just for me for my benefit for my fulfillment? Consider Luke chapter 18. It's a couple of stories there. We know the one about the Pharisee and the tax collector, they went to the temple and the Pharisee was, was there and was speaking to God, he was boasting. In himself, he was he was thanking God for making him so great, and so much better than all these other guys who are here, especially the old tax collector who's over there. As lowly as could be, of course, Jesus says that that tax collector was the one that would we justified that day. With that Pharisee is self righteousness was creating a barrier because he was creating a disregard for others. And it's ironic that he was doing so in a place of worship. Also, when Luke 18 There's a story of the rich, rulers, rich young man and the other gospels accounting, but this is the story of the man who came up to Jesus with his question, which was, how can I inherit eternal life? And so Jesus asked him a question he said, Well, have you kept the commandments You shall not murder, or commit adultery or bear false witness or steal, and you honor your mother and father. It's interesting to note that Jesus didn't start by asking him well do you love the Lord your God with all your heart, all your soul and all your mind? He didn't start there. He's Started with the Love thy neighbor commandments from the 10 commandments. That's where Jesus went when he was asked that question. For us to inherit eternal life, we have to be able to live out a faith where our love of God is shown and expressed in how we care for one another. Now, Jesus also pointed out what this what this guy was lacking, because he kept all those commandments. But Jesus said, Well, this is what you're lacking, need to sell all you that you have, and give it to the poor. And of course, he was dismayed to hear that this guy had a very perfect, but self interested faith, he was able to keep his nose clean, keep himself out of other people's troubles, and keeping those commandments. But when it came to put to he was lacking selflessness to others wasn't actively going out to help and share and in bear one another's burdens.

Unknown Speaker  21:19
You know, some acts of worship, we may do alone, we can do by ourselves. The Scripture informs us of ways that we can go about doing that. But according to Scripture, there's also some acts of worship that require us to be together. And we should be careful to consider the difference. In first Corinthians 14, Paul was instructing them that whenever you come together, the things that you're doing together, do the things that build you up, when he's referring to them as a whole.

Unknown Speaker  21:59
I normally would begin a lesson like this by starting off with terms and definitions here. But in New Testament, in the, in the Greek text, where our word fellowship is, is translated from the Greek word Koinonia. You can see the root coin a few you're familiar with coin, a Greek coin, a means common coin, a Greek was the common language in the first century. So you can see that there's something in common in the Koinonia. The define the definition is a shared activity, something that's held and in common or to hold something in common. And we see my my slides were done in Macintosh. They've been translated a little bit, it looks a little funny. They looked worse before they got fixed, they'll say that. Thank you for that. We've got several different translations in our Bibles where this word Koinonia. Is, is translated differently in a few different ways. The most common way that it's translated obviously, is fellowship. We also have sharing as a as a translation, the part words participation, partaking with partnership or all translations of Koinonia as well as contribution and communication, even communication being the sharing of ideas and expressions, but there's something that's together something that's being shared something that's being done, and this is what Christians were doing together. This was fellowship, to have an engage in the things that they held in common. And we'll get to some of those things that they held in common in a minute, but there's one other translation that's not on this list. And that's the word communion. That's another translation of Koinonia. that's found in First Corinthians chapter 10. That's the traditional King James translation that most of us are used to hearing in communion is a word that has become synonymous to the Lord's Supper. It doesn't matter what form of Christianity you're, you're in or came from. Someone says communion you think the Lord's Supper it has become a menten me or replacement word to that effect, but it also has taken on a connotative meeting that gives it a sort of exclusiveness, towards fellowship with God in the Lord's Supper. But if you replace the replacement word, this idea of of communion, which in our language is, is defined as being something that you experience or share in a very intimate sense, or an intimate level, which we can do that in the word supper, but communion has become an idea where that's exclusive to the Lord's Supper. But if you replace the replacement word, it doesn't seem to have that exclusive meaning. Apart from just being a shower, a sharing or a fellowship, the ESV uses a set of related words in First Corinthians chapter 10, that express a more consistent thought than to just say, communion.

Unknown Speaker  26:11
And first Corinthians chapter 10, verse 16, he says, the couple of blessing that we bless, is it not a participation in the blood of Christ? The bread that we break? Is it not a participation in the body of Christ? Because there's one bread we were many are one body, for we all partake of the one bread. Consider the people of Israel, or not those who eat the sacrifices participants in the altar? What do I imply, then the food offered to idols is anything for that an idol is anything? No, I employ that what pagan sacrifice they offer to demons, so not to God, I do not want you to be participants with demons. You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons, you cannot partake of the table of the Lord, and the table of demons. So it sort of gives a different characterization or emphasis. When you look at a participation and participants who partake. That's an idea where those people are joining in and doing something even the one who was worshiping was participating with those who would receive the offering at the altar. And God. I want to point out though, that first Corinthians chapter 10, isn't a passage that's about communion. Its passage isn't about the Lord's Supper, it's about idolatry. The Paul uses the Lord's Supper to make the point about idolatry. And yet we still have some that would see that the word supper is our only fellowship with God that it's nearly an exclusive type of fellowship. It's it is a form of fellowship with God. I would not say that it's our sole form of fellowship with God. And I wouldn't say that fellowship with God is is contingent upon any type of ritualism that we can engage in, in, in any form of worship. But there are those that would ask the question how, how can I commune with the Lord unless I have the word supper? I think there's fellowship found in God, if you haven't seen from what I've already discussed, the we have fellowship and every type of worship that we offer in prayer. We have fellowship with God. In song. We have fellowship, especially in God's word. It first John chapter one that we looked at the verses previous to that, John says that I'm writing this to you, so that you may have fellowship with us, because we have fellowship with God, through Jesus. We have fellowship with God in His Word. And of course, in the word separate, we have fellowship there. But in our life, our life should be full of fellowship, full of communion with our God. As we saw First John, chapter one, verses six and seven, walking in His light I'm walking in the way that God intends us according to His Word and His will. That's fellowship with God. That is to commune with with him in Matthew chapter 25 And verse 40. If you've done so to the least of mine, you have done so to me. And in John 14

Unknown Speaker  30:25
Jesus said yet a little while and the world will see me no more in verse 19, but you will see me because I live, you also will live. In that day, you will know that I am in my Father, and you in Me, and I and you, whoever has My commandments and keeps them he it is who loves me, and he who loves Me will be loved by My Father, and I will love him and manifest myself to him. And I didn't put it on the chart here also, but Romans chapter 12, to be living sacrifices, we present ourselves to God every day, in obedience, and we express that and the way that we go out and live among others and glorify Him so that others may also see in joining in glorify God as well.

Unknown Speaker  31:29
Back to the emphasis on fellowship in the New Testament. We saw in, in First Corinthians chapter 10, Paul says, because there's one bread we are many are one body, for we all take up the one bread in First Corinthians chapter 11. He says, a person examine himself then and so either the bread and drink of the cup for anyone who eats and drinks without discerning the body eats and drinks judgment on itself. So Paul's talking about the unity of one body, doing something together in chapter 10, and chapter 11. And in chapter 12, he continues to talk about the body of Christ being us. Verse 12, for just as the body is one and has many members, and all the members of the body, and all the members of the body, though many are one body, so it is with Christ, for in one Spirit, we were all baptized into one body, Jews or Greeks, slaves are free, and all were made to drink of one spirit, for the body does not consists of one member, but of many. And Skipping down to verse 21, the eye cannot say to the hand, I have no need of you, nor getting the head to the feet, I have no need of you. And on the contrary, the parts of the body that seem to be weak are indispensable. And in verse 24, but God is so composed the body giving greater honor to the part that lacked it, that there may be no division in the body, but that the members may have the same care for one another. If one member suffers, all suffer together, one member is honored all rejoice together. Now you are the body of Christ and individually members of it. We see the togetherness, that that intimacy that we need to have with one another in the body that God has composed us to be in where he is our head. Also, when Ephesians chapter four, a couple of weeks ago, we read through the first three chapters of Ephesians, which was full of all types of unity and fellowship language and chapter for pretty much the entire chapter. I could read tonight, but I'll just read a couple of bits here. And Ephesians four, either for a prisoner for the Lord urge you to walk in a manner worthy of the calling to which you have been called with all humility and gentleness, with patience bearing with one another in love, eager to maintain the unity of the Spirit and the bond of peace. There is one body and one Spirit, just as you were called to the one hope that belongs to your call. One Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and Father of all, who is overall and through all and in all verse 15, rather speaking the truth and love we are to grow up in every way into him who is the head into Christ from whom the whole body joined and held together by every joint with which it is equipped when each part is working properly, makes the body grow so that it builds itself up in love. And then again at the end of the chapter, let no corrupting talk come out of your mouths, but only such as as good for building up as fits the occasion that it may give grace to those who hear. Do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God by whom you were sealed for the day of redemption. But all bitterness and wrath and anger and clamor and slander be put away from you, along with all malice. Be kind to one another, tender hearted, forgiving one another as God in Christ forgave you. But the sense of unity that our fellowship should bring to us in all of these things that we share the oneness, to which we have been brought needs to be recognized and

Unknown Speaker  36:11
appreciated. Colossians chapter three, verse 12, and 15. Therefore is God's chosen people, holy and dearly loved. clothe yourselves with compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness and patience. Bear with each other and forgive one another. If any of you has a grievance against someone, forgive as the Lord forgave you. And over all these virtues put on love which binds them all together in perfect unity. Let the peace of Christ rule in your hearts since as members of one body, you were called to peace and be thankful. And looking out for others interests, as shown in Philippians chapter two, therefore, if you have any encouragement from being united with Christ, if any comfort from his love, if any common sharing in the Spirit, if any tenderness and compassion and make my joy complete by being like minded, having the same love, being one in spirit and of mind, do nothing out of selfish ambition or vain conceit, rather, in humility, value others above yourselves, not looking to your own interests, but each of you to the interests of others. And that was the NIV translation that I read from that time. But there are other other passages like these, I could continue to look at and, and, and point out concerning the type of fellowship that each of us has together, as we seek to worship and follow God, to be disciples of Jesus together, to live as his saved ones. There is a great emphasis on our togetherness, on our unity on our peace, and to look out for one another, as we serve our God. fellowship that's aligned with Christ forgives, and is forgiven. It seeks harmony, it seeks unity. it reconciles and is being reconciled. And fellowship that's aligned with Christ fulfills the law of Christ, that we love one another, that each of us love thy neighbor. And it's also proactive. I think about Luke chapter 10. When someone asked Jesus well, who is my neighbor? And Jesus decided to tell that great parable about the Good Samaritan. And at the end of that story, when the Samaritan has done what he did and gone on his way, Jesus asked about that man who he saved and said, who was a neighbor to him? He was inverting that question. Each of us is our own neighbor to each other. We need to look out for and watch for one another because that is how we love our neighbor. Our relationship with God is expressed through our relationship with others. You I think the only way that in this lifetime we're able to see God is to pay attention to one another. We can see his hand in action, we can see his Spirit at work in our lives. You know, sports analogy time, but it's a brief one. We have the expression there's no I in team. But there is an AI in Christ. So I figured that the AI in Christ comes from that passage that we read in John chapter four, I'm I am in my Father in you and me and I in you. But at any rate, you can't have Jesus without us. Our fellowship with one another is inherent in having a fellowship with our God and Father in heaven. I'll close the lesson this night and extend the the invitation with this really beautiful passage

Unknown Speaker  41:10
from Romans chapter 15. May the God of endurance and encouragement grant you to live in such harmony with one another, in accord with Jesus Christ, that together you may with one voice glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ. Therefore welcome one another as Christ has welcomed you for the glory of God. We'd like to welcome you to join into the fellowship that we share with one another to fellowship that we share through Jesus Christ, the Son of our God and Father, we would invite you to come and be baptized, repent of your sins and begin that journey where you walk in his white every day with a loving God and His loving son our Savior, we invite you to come now tonight while we stand and sing the song
