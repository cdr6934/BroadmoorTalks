Good to be able to speak before you once again, go ahead and turn in your Bibles to the Gospel of John will be basing the first part of our lesson on the Gospel of John. Appreciate the opportunity to speak, I hope and pray that something I say this morning will be beneficial to you. And I do pray that my words are based on truth. If you have any questions about what I say this morning, or if you don't think anything, or something I've said is based on truth, please let me know please talk to me afterwards. And I would appreciate that. And appreciate Kyle's lesson in the adult class this morning. I appreciate curse words. And I appreciate Dave's selection of songs. And they all have something to do with what I propose to speak, speak about this morning. There's different ways to analyze the book of John, the Gospel of John. John likes the use of the word seven, or that number seven, there are the seven signs or miracles in the Gospel of John the seven I am statements of Jesus, the seven titles of Jesus, you could analyze John by looking at the feast that he covers that that Jesus attends. And what he does that those feasts culminating with the Passover, during his last week of life, John was very deliberate about what he included in his Gospel. Jesus often put himself in harm's way. And we see that in the in the book of John, and almost always he met opposition or controversy with what he did or what he said. So the outline that I want to use this morning, in just a general way, is just is kind of a 30,000 foot view of John, the chapter one we know includes the prologue, in the beginning was the word word was with God and the Word was God, speaking, of course of Jesus, but also hearkening back to Genesis one, there was a beginning there, this is a new beginning with Christ. And later in verse 14, we see how that word became flesh, and welcome among us, Jesus did tabernacle with men. Later, also, in that chapter, we see different titles given to Jesus in those in himself, could cause controversy by the things he was claiming just in chapter one, the very beginning of the book. But the prologue is mirrored by an epilogue, in chapter 21, the last chapter of the book, and this is after the death, burial and resurrection of Christ when Jesus gives further instructions to his disciples. And the very middle of the book is chapter 12, which I call a transition because it transitions from the ministry of Jesus to his last week. And John spends a great deal of the book of John, the Gospel of John, on that last week of Jesus. So chapter 12 is very important. It deals with some very important topics. In chapter 12, it includes his triumphal entrance into Jerusalem as he begins that last week. But there's two things connecting all of these, first of all, is chapters two through 11, which include includes those seven signs and all the controversy that went with them. And then the last part is that last week, and see how much space that John gives to that last week of Jesus, all all chapters 13 through 20, in chapter 11, right before that transitional chapter in chapter 12, there is a great sign there. And that's the raising of Lazarus, and that causes, we might say, the greatest controversy, according to John in Jesus life, and we're going to focus on that. So if we were to blow that that box up there, we can further divide those chapters into three sections. That's the way I'm going to look at it. And first, it's chapters two through four, which I'm going to call the institutions that Jesus challenges. And then the feast that she Jesus challenges or makes claims about in chapters five through 10, and then chapter 11, we'll we'll deal with on its own just a little bit later.

Unknown Speaker  04:47
There's a basic pattern in chapters two through 11 and that Jesus will perform a sign or he will, he will make a claim a great claim and then people are going to read react to that. They're going to react in different ways. Sometimes they totally misunderstand what what Jesus is trying to say. Or they'll be confused. Or they'll just have great wonder about what Jesus did or claimed. But sometimes people got angry, and even took their anger to a different level. And then those people have to make a choice. What Who is this man does see Is he really who he claims to be. And I'll just note that all all of the seven signs if we exclude the the resurrection, but the seven signs of John are included in chapters two through 11, and we won't be looking at all of them, all of them, but we will mention a few of them. First of all, and chapter two, Jesus we might say, not attacks, but at least addresses Jewish society in general, when he goes to a wedding at Cana in chapter two, and I'm not going to, you can follow along if you if you would in your text, but I won't be turning to all of these. But in chapter two, of course, at the wedding feast, Jesus turns the water to wine. You remember how they say that you've kept the best for last, John calls this a sign. And in the book of John, a miracle is referred to as a sign which points us to something else that points us to a lesson. Something about Jesus that we're supposed to get, it's symbolic of something. This feast here, may have reference references to Isaiah 25, and also Isaiah to Messianic prophecies, saying that the Messianic Kingdom, or the Messiah's kingdom would, would come with richness and abundance. Jesus was demonstrating here, that he was the fulfillment of this prophecy of the generosity that would be found in the kingdom, the abundance. And you remember the result of this miracle, the sign there was great amazement among the people. And it says in the text that there was belief amongst his disciples, they responded with belief. In chapter two, a little bit later, we see that Jesus drove the money changers from the temple. The temple, of course, was a sacred place to the Jews, is where God met with man. Here Jesus is demonstrating His authority over the temple by recognizing that the worship that's going on there is incorrect. It's wrong. It's it's become polluted and corrupt and defiled. So he cleanses it. And the Jewish leaders are very angry and ask how, how is it that you can be doing this? And that's when Jesus says, Destroy this temple? And in three days, I will raise it up. So what was he saying? Well, later the text tells us he was referring to His body and His resurrection. But But Why use the term temple here? When we remember in chapter one, verse 14, that the Word became flesh and dwelt among us that Jesus tabernacled with his people. So the temple itself pointed to Jesus because it was in Christ, where God ultimately chose to dwell with man because Jesus became man, he was man and God. So we remember here that the the reaction of the people of the leaders especially, is one of anger. In chapter three, you remember that Jesus has a discussion with Nicodemus. Now Nicodemus was a rabbi, probably representative here of the of the teachers of all of Judaism. And Nicodemus just thinks that Jesus is another another teacher, just another Jewish rabbi. Jesus, in essence is saying to Nicodemus here that Jews don't need just another good teacher. They don't need any more teachers. What they knew is something what they need is something new. They need a new life. They need a new heart, they need a new birth. He says they need to be born again chapter three verses three through five. And Jesus tells Nicodemus that he must believe in the Son of man in order to have eternal life. And Nicodemus is Ken reaction is confusion and wonder about the words of Jesus.

Unknown Speaker  09:36
In chapter four, you have the story of the woman at the well and Jesus discussion with her and we remember that Jews don't associate with Samaritans but Jesus not only associates with the Samaritan, but he associates with a Samaritan woman and they have a discussion about water and worship. He offers her living water, that which will nourish her spirit not Her physical thirst. So Jesus is saying that he is the source of eternal life to anyone, a Jew of Samaritan origin tile, those that will heed His words, even Jewish worship, he goes on to say, centered in Jerusalem and Samaritan worship, located there in Mount gara zoom would become non factors location is not the issue that wouldn't matter anymore. Worship would be in spirit and in truth. And if we read the article read the text. The result was Wonder and belief among the Samaritans. Well, in the next section of this first part of the Gospel of John, in chapters five through 10, John associates Jesus with the four with four Jewish feasts or holy days, and the first one is the Sabbath, chapter five, verse nine. And it just happened to be during the feast, if you see in verse one there. But here's where he healed the the invalid, who had been sick for 38 years. And Jesus just told him to take off his bed and walk, just get up and walk away. Well, this angered the Jewish leaders because Jesus was doing work on the Sabbath. And Jesus later told the leaders, my father is working until now and I am working. So Jesus is saying a couple of things here, he's making himself one with God. And also that he himself can decide what can and can't be done on the Sabbath. Because he authored it. The text says the result of all this was that the Jews began persecuting Jesus, and they were even seeking to kill him. So the reaction to Jesus is beginning to heat up. In chapter six, we have the Passover, the feeding of the 5000, at the Passover. And there's a lot of symbolism in this chapter. And you remember that the Passover celebration, including included eating and drinking, you had the bread, the lamb, and later it was customary to drink wine, in the Passover celebration, but Jesus feeds the crowd from you remember a small amount of bread and fish. And later on in, in his discourse with the people. He refers to the manna that bread from heaven that Moses gave the wandering Israelites. He goes on to say Jesus goes on to say that he is the true bread from heaven, and that those that follow that are following him, need to eat him, he's the Bread of Heaven. And you remember that in chapter one, Jesus was called the Lamb of God, he was the Passover. So all of this had a very defiant divisive effect on his followers and many chose to not walk with him anymore. They left him but his closest ones, stayed with him. Next we see the the Feast of Tabernacles and chapters seven through 10. This feast commemorated the Israelites wandering their dwelling and booths, being led by God through the wilderness by the pillars of fire and cloud. And this feast called remembrance God's provisions for his people by giving them food and water in the desert. And Jesus proclaims at this feast, if anyone thirst, let him come to me and drink chapter seven, verse 37. And then later on, he says, I'm the light of the world, Whoever follows me will not walk in darkness, but will have the light of life. chapter eight, verse 12. Jesus is saying that he is the fulfillment of this feast, he gives provision to those that are in spiritual need. And there's mixed reaction again, some believe and follow. Others are offended by what he said. And still others want to kill him on the spot.

Unknown Speaker  14:04
The final one we'll look at is the Feast of Dedication. And that's also called Hanukkah or the the feast of lights. And you will remember this it was a celebration of when Judas Maccabeus cleansed the temple that had been defiled by Antiochus epiphanies back in the second century BCE, Judas rededicated the temple to purity and holiness. But at this feast, Jesus makes more bold claims. He says again, that he and his father are one chapter 10, verse 30, and then they take up stones to kill him. But he says in verse 36, that God has set him apart, made him holy, set him apart and sent him to the world, an obvious reference to the Holy Temple. Your version may say something like consecrated or sanctified there in that verse, But God's presence is in him. He Is the temple and He is here to do a holy work. God's Will God set him apart to do His will. And so they seek to arrest him. And so Jesus withdraws from the city he chooses to do that. And that's important to remember he withdraws from the city. So if he shows his face again, that you say that he'll be taken prisoner and be later killed, the intent is to kill him. In essence, he has an arrest warrant taken out on him. So if we review the reactions to these institutions in these feasts, just briefly, at the at the wedding, there was Wonder and belief amongst the people at the temple when He cleansed the temple there was confusion and anger. With Nicodemus he was confused and and wonder. With the Samaritans there was fear and belief. As we come to the feast. Notice how the reaction is getting a little bit stronger. At the the healing of the man on the Sabbath, there was a seeking to persecute Jesus and a desire to kill him. At the Passover, many left Jesus because what he had to say was divisive to them. At the Feast of Tabernacles, there was a mixed reaction, some were offended, and some wanted to stone him on the spot. And then finally, here at the Feast of Dedication, the arrest warrant was put out for Jesus, he has a mark on his head. By the time we get to the end of chapter 10, the Jewish leaders are angry. And they're making specific plans about how they can get rid of Jesus. All of these conflicts and controversies we see in the in the first 10 chapters, I think, point us to one last great sign in chapter 11. And that's the raising of Lazarus, you remember that Lazarus, and Mary and Martha were dear friends of Jesus, the Lazarus has sick, he's near to death. The problem is, is that to go see Lazarus, Jesus would have to come back to Jerusalem, or at least near to Jerusalem. If he goes back to help, he'll be risking his life. If you look at verse eight, and chapter 11, the disciples said to him, Rabbi, the Jews were just now seeking to stone you and you're going back there again. He knew what he was getting into. And the disciples recognize that as well. So Jesus can stay where he is, and perhaps do some good where he is, and save his own life. But he loves Lazarus, he must go. So he lingers two more days where he is, and during this time, Lazarus dies. But when he and his disciples arrive, Lazarus has been dead for days. There's much mourning among among his family and his friends. And Jesus has moved with compassion for them and even weeps himself. He asked to visit the tomb. And he does what was probably unthinkable at that moment. He tells them to remove the stone. He calls for Lazarus to come out. And Lazarus does indeed walk out of the tomb, very much alive. Jesus has raised Lazarus from the dead. But by giving life to this one, Jesus determined death for himself. Because news of the resurrection spreads quickly. And from that day forward, the Jewish leaders are making specific plans to kill Jesus, his fate is sealed. So as a result of this miracle, many believe, but his fate is sealed, and the Jews are making plans to kill him.

Unknown Speaker  18:51
Well, not only was Lazarus resurrection, symbolic of anaphor, wrote for runner of Jesus's own resurrection. It was also the last of Jesus recorded signs in the book of John and it pointed toward his own death as well. Jesus laid down his life for his friend, which directs us to the second half of the book. If we go back to our overall structure of John, it brings us to chapter 12. That transitional chapter, which transition transitions us into the last week of Jesus, it's an important week, his last upon the earth as a man. In chapter 12, Jesus writes boldly and confidently and triumphantly and voluntarily into Jerusalem, knowing his fate, but determined to carry out his father's will. He does understand as chapter 12 tells us that he will be lifted up, He will be crucified, but by that death, He will draw all people to Himself. In fact, Jesus life was characterized by the principle of denying self and giving for others All his life. His was a hard and humble life. Instead of an easy, luxurious one, he gave up comfort. He had no home to call his own nowhere to lay his head. He didn't always know where his meals were coming from. He went without sleep and food many times to teach and to heal. He washed his disciples feet, John 13, he gave up what we might call dignity, and became a servant. In Philippians, two, which we refer to often, this describes his leaving heaven and becoming man. But as the text tells us, Philippians, two, five through eight, he left his exalted heavenly place, to become a humble human helper, a submissive servant, slave. So look at all the phrases that describes his humility. He didn't think the quality with with God is something he had to hold on to, he was willing to let it go. He emptied Himself, He took the form of a servant, He humbled himself and he was obedient to the point of death. Of course, Jesus act of saving his friend was looking forward to when he would set aside his own personal well being, in a big way by being crucified. He was the sacrifice, he bore the wrath of God, all those things, to save all of us. When Jesus looked down at the cross, he didn't see a lot of friends. He saw mostly unloving people. They didn't love him, but he loved them. And for their good he remained on the cross. He laid down His life for the sheep, John chapter 10. And verse 11. Jesus is teaching us some basic principles about service that will develop in in the rest of the lesson. And first of all, I think we can we should talk about mastering self. This is not a new principle. It goes back to Genesis, when when God told Cain, that he had to master himself because God didn't have regard to Cain offering. But God told Cain, is it not true that if you do what is right, you will be fine. But if you do not do what is right, sin is crouching at the door. It desires to dominate you, but you must subdue it. Genesis four, seven. It's a dangerous thing not to master ourself, because Satan is just waiting to pounce when we give him opportunity. We're familiar with Luke nine verses 23 and 24, where Jesus said, If anyone would come after Me, let him deny himself, take up his cross daily and follow Me. The Christian must deny himself take up his cross that personal instrument of death, for those times when we need to die to self, and we die to self in order to love and to serve others, because we can't properly serve others. If we're putting ourselves first. Verse 24 goes on to say, for whoever would save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his life, for my sake will save it. You know, selfishness is natural. Selfishness is pretty easy. That's saving our life. That's what Jesus refers to when he says, when you want to save your own life, you're speaking selfish, and we unconsciously choose that, but selflessness is unnatural, that's losing your life. That's a conscious choice.

Unknown Speaker  23:48
When someone joins the military, they break that person down. So he would give up his personal rights for the good of the group. In sports, you did not you deny your own personal ambition and glory for the sake of the team. We must master yourself for the good of all. Secondly, I would say that we give our best and this goes back to the Old Testament as well. In Old Testament worship, the people had to give their best, you know that unblemished male land would have been really beneficial to keep for the sake of the flock. Those first fruits of the harvest would have been really hard to give up, because they'd been waiting on the harvest for months, but the first of it they had to give to God. They gave to their own hurt Leviticus 23, Exodus 34, and many other passages. It was a sign of trust to offer the first fruits to God. They were counting on God to supply their needs for months to come. In the New Testament, Hebrews 1315 speaks of our Sacher FEIS of praise, implying the best we can give, to give the best in anything. We prepare, we study we practice. We do it orderly. The same goes for our worship. So giving our best should not only define our worship but all areas of our life. And thirdly, I would say we serve others selflessly self, Leslie, in Second Corinthians five, verses 14 and 15, in verse 2021, it says, For the love of Christ controls us, because we have concluded this, that one has died for all, therefore all have died. And he died for all that those who might live might no longer live for themselves. But for him, who for their sake, died and was raised in verse 21. For our sake, he made him to be sin, who knew no sin that so that in him we might become the righteousness of God? But did you notice that he died for all that those who might live no longer live for themselves? Anything that drives us more than God's love, like our personal ambition, our personal gain, that's not going to allow us to serve others selflessly? Because he died for us. We no longer live for ourselves, we live for God and we live for others. And we need to constantly ask ourselves, does my life really look like that? Like this verse describes, if Jesus laid down his life for us, we can we can put ourselves out there. For others, we can give up personal time, to give some of our time to others time that maybe you could have spent working, providing for your family, maybe giving up somebody of your own family time. Yes, job and family time are important. But consider those that consider others that may need your time as well. Yes, we do have to strike a balance and that's difficult. Sometimes, we only have so much time we can work with. But if Jesus laid down his life for us, we can put ourselves in uncomfortable and awkward situations sometimes. Sometimes making a stand for godly principles at your workplace may make for an awkward situation. But if God died, if Jesus died for us, we can do that. We can invite someone to church services or to a Bible study. If Jesus laid down his life for us, it's really not much to ask of us. If Jesus laid down his life for us, we can give up some money that may hurt us. Scripture has taught us to be generous with what we have with what God has blessed us with back in Second Corinthians eight verses one through three, and a discussion Paul's having about the gift given given to the Jerusalem saints. He talks about the churches in Macedonia, in their poverty gave beyond their means. You get that they were in poverty to begin with, but then gave beyond their means that that hurts. That wasn't in their budget. And second Corinthians nine, verses six through 12. In this same type of discussion in the context of giving to the needs of the Jerusalem saints, Paul gives some general principles about giving. Whoever so sparingly will also reap sparingly whoever sows bountifully will also reap bountifully. God loves a cheerful giver.

Unknown Speaker  28:35
God is able to make all grace abounds to us so that having all sufficiency and all things at all times you may have found in every good work, he is distributed freely he has given to the poor, his righteousness endures forever, he'll supply and multiply your seed for sowing and increase the harvest of your righteousness, you will be enriched in every way to be generous in every way. If we give generously, God will make sure we can go on giving. It's not about giving so that we can get more it's about giving so that we can give more. You remember the story of the of the Good Samaritan in Luke chapter 10. He went out of his way, when others wouldn't. He helped a man who we knew probably wouldn't do the same for him. He had compassion. He gave up his schedule for this man for the stranger. He got personally involved by binding his wounds himself. He gave up his money for him. He showed mercy. If we don't master our own self, will have no desire to give the best. When we give, we're responding to God's goodness. We're showing compassion and mercy reflecting on the character of God. We need to keep trying to understand the character of God and having a part of our life when we begin to understand his character will want to imitate it more, and serve others. We must always be willing to give up things for the good of all. Jesus said, we'll find our life when we give up our life. And that takes time and commitment. In his book, The meaning of marriage, Timothy Keller says fulfillment is on the far side of sustained, unselfish service, not on the near side. It takes time, and commitment and marriage, but in all other relationships, as well. For the rest of the lesson, and quickly, I want to apply that specific act of love that Jesus had for his friend Lazarus, you remember that he set aside his own personal safety to come to the aid of a close friend? You ever thought? What if? What if it's not a close friend, that you come to the aid of what if it's a stranger who's in danger? Have you ever put your life on the line? You ever had to do that for somebody somebody else? Do you know, if somebody that had to do that we hear of stories of somebody pushing somebody out of the way of a speeding bus or car and putting themselves in the way instead, or someone donated an Oregon to help another putting themselves at risk, or you hear those war stories about someone taking a bullet for someone else, or going into danger zones and rescuing the injured and taking them out of there. Or you hear about a child that falls off the subway subway platform and somebody jumps in to save them before the subway train comes. We've all heard stories of what happened on 911 how there were many acts of heroism by first responders and by civilians, actually giving up their lives for others. In many cases like that the decision is spur of the moment. You have no time to think about it, you just react and you just do it. It doesn't matter if you know the person or if that person is a good person or a bad person you just react to save a human being a fellow human being, even if it's a stranger. What if you do have time to think about it? What do you what if you have to decide whether to put your life on the line? Does it make a difference who the person is? In Romans five, and this is probably the texture you're thinking about. In Romans chapter five, verses six through 11. It gives us kind of a general idea, I guess from were worldly standards, about what people think about think about dying for somebody else, where Paul said, For one will scarcely die for a righteous person, though perhaps for a good person, one would dare even to die. But it's in this context. He talks about Jesus. He says from worldly standards, most people probably wouldn't give up their life for someone they didn't think was worth it. But look what Jesus did. When we were weak, when we were ungodly, when we were sinners, when we were enemies. Jesus died for us. He gave us blood, He gave His life for us.

Unknown Speaker  33:23
And look at look what happened. Because of that we've been justified, we've been saved from the wrath of God, we've been reconciled. We've received reconciliation. And all because of the love of God for us. That's what love looks like. Because love acts. And love acted here, whether we were it was for all people. It was for all people for all time. The opportunity to actually give up your life for someone else is, is probably pretty rare. Those opportunities may not come in our life. But I'm sure every parent here would give up his or her life for their child. I'm sure every spouse would disregard their own safety for the physical safety of their mate. But let's talk about some of the extensions of this idea. There are some extensions of this principle that are pretty common actually. ones we can practice almost every day. The Scripture teaches us about giving up things for the sake of others all through the Bible. So I'd like to look at just three areas of life and there's probably many areas we could look at, and I'll do this quickly. But maybe you can make application to other areas of your of your life. Let's look at the church. And I promise you I didn't get with Kyle on these three areas. But you'll see some similarities. Kyle's were very similar to mine. In Ephesians, chapter five and verse 22, and following look Get what Jesus did for the church. He died to do what? to sanctify her, sanctify meaning to make her holy, to set her aside, set her apart to make her holy. He put his he put our needs above his, for our good and to his hurt, He died for the church. So in response, the church willingly submits to the authority of Christ, knowing he is a loving leader, fulfilling his role. And that same with the husband and wife relationship, which we'll look at in just a minute. But the church willingly submit to to the authority of Christ. Because he is God. He's a loving leader, he fulfills his role. If you think back to the New Testament Church, think about the Jews and Gentiles that came together, the Jews had to put away their, their their notion, their long held hatred of the Gentiles, in order to accept them as as brothers in Christ. That was very difficult. I don't think we know how difficult that was. That was a long held belief. But they did it. In Second Corinthians four, verses 11 and 12. Paul sacrifice for the good of church of the churches he was working with, the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our mortal flesh. So death is at work in us, but life in you. He worked for the good of the churches he was associated with in Philippians 121 through 26. Paul describes how it was, for him, death would be better because he could be with Christ then. But he sacrificed to keep preaching and working with churches. He says, For to me to live as Christ and to die is gain my desire. My desire is to depart and be with Christ. But that's better. But to remain in the flesh is more necessary on your account. It was definitely a sacrifice for Paul to keep working because he was often persecuted. But their greater good was to keep serving the churches. What about churches today? What are about our local group? What about when it comes to decisions in the church? Well, members willingly submit to the authority of elders, even when their decisions may go against some members personal desires, we willingly submit to one another Ephesians five, verse 21, members may have to set aside their personal wishes for the for the good of the group. That's how churches work together. Because of the example of Jesus, we come to the aid of our sister, our brother in Romans 15 1333. It says, We who are strong have an obligation to bear with the failings of the weak and not to please ourselves, let each of us please his neighbor, for his good to build him up for Christ did not please himself. It would be easier to ignore our brother or sisters problem. You just wish it would go away. Maybe Maybe they'll work it out. It's easier to please ourselves by just minding our own business, that Paul says it's our obligation. That's not a suggestion. It's an obligation. We're risking some things here we're risking that awkward situation, maybe that sister or brother will get defensive. We don't know how our future relationship is going to be affected.

Unknown Speaker  38:23
And we all of course, we always use discretion and tact and we show love in those situations. And there will come times when we we put ourselves in in our risky situations that escalation six tells us when when someone is caught in a transgression, you who are spiritual should restore him a spirit of gentleness, keep watch on yourself, lest YouTube be tempted, Bear one another's burdens and so fulfill the law of Christ. There'll be a time when we may put ourselves at risk when we go to the aid of a brother, but we still do it. We pray for others, we bear their burdens burdens, even if it means we're at risk. Let's look at family quickly marriage and family. There's no better area than the family relationship to see the principle of sacrifice demonstrated. This is the slide we had before speaking about Christ's relationship to the church and what he does he did for the church. But look at at the application of that. Because of that Wives submit to their husbands as to the Lord. Husbands love their wives, husbands love their wives as their own bodies. Let each one of you love his wife as himself and let the wife see that she respects her husband because of what Jesus said because of his relationship to the church what he did for the church. The wife willingly submits to the authority of her husband, knowing he is a loving leader, like Christ as a loving leader of the church. He's fulfilling his role as Christ is he's following the lead of Christ in the same way the husband leads and his family remember back in Ruth chapter One, Ruth didn't know exactly what she was getting into when she committed to Naomi. But she did know she was giving up her home and her family for the good of another. She took a took a great risk there, she had no idea what she was getting into. When you give yourself in marriage, husbands need to remember that their wife is putting, putting her love and her feelings and her emotions at risk. And vice versa. She's investing in you and committing and sacrificing for the marriage. both spouses have a willingness to change for the sake of the other for the sake of the marriage, you may have to give up something that's really precious to you. But you do it for the sake of your spouse, and the vows you took. And it's voluntary, it's not cool, coerce, like Jesus on the cross. The wife respects the husband loves the child obeys, and that's voluntarily because they respect what Christ did. Jesus loved us on the cross when we were unlovable, because he committed to the Father's will and our good he stayed on the cross. Spouses stay in marriage when it's hard because of commitment. You stay in marriage when the warm fuzzies have faded. Because love is an act, wives still respect their husbands even when they become unrespectable. Husbands still love their wives when they become become unlovable, because you're committed because Jesus showed you the pattern. If it wasn't beneath the dignity or divinity of Jesus to leave heaven and assume the role of a footwashing servant, is it asking too much of us to live out our proper role in marriage. We die to self in order to love and serve our spouses. In marriage, we make our vows and then we trust. That vow is what keeps you from running away from your commitment. That's what keeps you from having affairs. You give up certain freedoms, but for the greater good because you love God and you love your spouse, and you stay committed to your vows. You give love a chance to create stability in your marriage. It gets you through the rough patches, and it gives your spouse security for the future. you limit your freedom now in order to be there in the future for the one who put their trust in you. Final point, strangers and the world's Psalm 15. Ask the question, oh Lord, who sow shall sojourn in your tent? Who shall dwell on Your holy hill? And then it gives a bunch of answers. The one who walks blamelessly does what is right does not slander that doesn't take over reproach. But look at the end. It says those who swear to his own heart and does not change and who does not put out his money at interest? How do we apply this principle to strangers in the world. The godly individual takes his commitments to others so seriously, he's willing to swear to his own hurt. That means he'll take a loss to keep his promises. And he won't take interest on loan until he'll allow himself to take less than what to do him. And Luke 27. We won't read all this. But this is from the Sermon on the plane. And just summarizing this, this is what Jesus says, extend love to your enemies. Do good to those who hate you bless those who curse you. Pray for those who abuse you offer the other cheek to the one that strikes you on one or someone takes your clothes, give him your tunic. If they beg give, if they take your goods don't demand them back. And in summarizing this, Jesus says do the golden rule. As you wish that others would do to you do so to them. Love your enemies, do good land, expect nothing in return. Your reward will be great, you will be sons of the Most High he is kind to the ungrateful and the evil. There's one of those characteristics of God that we should imitate. He is kind to the ungrateful and the evil, be merciful, even as your Father is merciful.

Unknown Speaker  44:03
We've already talked about the Good Samaritan and what he did for a stranger and and I'll ask that you remember those points, but in Galatians, six, verse 10, it tells us, let's not be tired of doing good, don't grow weary of doing good. Let us do good to everyone, especially to those who have the household of faith, giving time and money and food to others, even if it means we go without please the Estes 11. One says, Cast your bread on the waters that will come back to you broadcasted. That's to everyone. These are just three areas of application in general areas that we could and we could probably talk about other areas as well as well. But just to include to conclude this morning. All of this is related to the command to love your neighbor as yourself. And that's an old principle going back to Leviticus 19 repeated in the New Testament. Many times in Galatians, five and James two, naturally, we won't consciously harm ourself, and we should extend that attitude and even more to our neighbor. Remember that Jesus emptied himself. And he did those three things, three things we talked about before those three principles, he mastered self, he came to do His Father's will not his own. He gave his best in his teaching, and is demonstrating the power of God and giving his life and he served other self lessly he left heaven, He taught, he healed, and he suffered and he continues to serve by interceding for us. May we reflect more often on the selflessness of our Savior, He went to save a friend from death, knowing he was signing his own death warrant, he went to the cross to save us, he laid down his life. So may we continue to learn the attributes of our father that we've discussed today? love, mercy, compassion, and then go on to demonstrate them in our lives. Two, concluding thoughts, two concluding passages, John 1513. Greater love has no one than this, that someone lay down his life for his friends, and another passage by John and First John 316. By this we know love that he laid down his life for us, and we ought to lay down our lives for the brothers. So how are we doing? On laying down our lives? Let's never forget what the Lord did for us and what we should do in turn for others. If you need to respond to the Lord's invitation this morning. We asked you to come at this time as we stand and sing
