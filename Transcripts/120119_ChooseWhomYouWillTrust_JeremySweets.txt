Good morning. Good to see everyone here. I have many friends and family that are here. We just finished a good holiday week. I trust that no one has a start this past week. It's good to see, like I said many friends and family, I see Jacob and his fiancee here. Good to see you all here. I see Miss Carol beaming over there, she has all her children and her grandchild. So there are many other friends and family here. We're glad to see each and every one of you. We're glad the members are here that we can come here and worship God. I'd like to begin this morning with the quiz. I know that Conrad in his review class had a quiz. I thought that went pretty well. So I thought we would begin with an English quiz this morning and just ask the simple question Which sentence is correct? Okay, choose who you will trust. Choose whom you will trust? Whom knows? Or whom cares? Or none of the above? Okay, and you have your answer in your head. Okay, I think it's B, choose whom you will trust. Choose whom you will trust. I'll also accept none of the above. I know you're not supposed to capitalize all those other words, only the first one? Or possibly who knows? That may also be correct. Well, that's the title of the sermon this morning. And that's the primary question that's asked as we open our Bibles and look at Isaiah chapter seven for nine. And Isaiah seven through nine, the historical context for the events there is the cero ephraimite war or conflict, and that involves Syria Aetherium, or Northern Israel and Judah as they're going to be dealing with a Syria and so the battle is not between Syria or Rome and Aetherium but they are a coalition. This happens in the eighth century as a Syria is becoming the dominant power in fact, most of those Mediterranean nations there in Palestine and the surrounding nations were paying tribute to a Syria Syria was the dominant power Syria or wrong was also growing in power. And they decided to build a coalition to challenge a Syria and so Syria and resin the king of Damascus the capital city there and Pekka the king of the northern tribes of Israel, they come together against King a has in Jerusalem and they want the him to join together in the coalition but I have seems to Ray has seems to refuse just to give you some general dates, we see that resin and Pekka resin was the king of Rome. And he rains from 750 to 732. So right at 20 years there, Pekka rains about that same amount of time. And so this is toward the end of their reign. And this is the beginning of the reign of I haves. And so they ask a has to join them in their coalition to fight a Syria. Okay, is everyone tracking with me? You're following? What's going on here. And that's where we start or that's the context for Isaiah chapter seven. Isaiah chapter seven, resident Peca are asking Ahaz to join them in their coalition. Choose whom you will trust. And this is the message we see in Isaiah seven. We'll get to chapter eight, verses 11 through 15 In a moment, but began in chapter seven and notice the first two verses Isaiah seven one and two. In the days of Ahaz, the son of Joseph the son of Uzziah, king of Judah, resin the king of Syria and Pekka the Son of Rome, Elia, the king of Israel came up to Jerusalem to wage war against it, but could not yet mount an attack against it. When the house of David was told Syria is in league with Aetherium, the heart of Ahaz and the heart of his people shook as the trees of the forest shake before the wind.

Jeremy Sweets  04:37
When the coalition the mighty forces of Syria and the northern tribes of Israel come against Ahaz in Jerusalem and surround the city, when he hears about what's going on, it says that he shook with fear. He was afraid, and so he was afraid of what was going to happen. Isaiah is going to come To Ahaz with a message, and it's gonna unfold really throughout the book of Isaiah, but we're gonna be focusing on chapter seven through the first part of chapter nine. And what's fascinating about this is a he has is a really going to be shown to be an arrogant and willful person. And Isaiah, the prophet is going to use a child in several of his messages to reveal the arrogance of the man he has. And he's going to use the child and all its innocence and faithfulness and trusting of a parent to convict a US. So that's what I want to look at this morning. And the messages that that Isaiah is trying to ask Ahaz is who are you going to trust? Now you see the ploidies in right. He's happened to choose between a Syria and Syria and the northern tribes of Israel, at least that's how he sees his choices. Which power am I going to align myself with? Well, Isaiah comes and says, You need to choose God, rather than these mighty nations. And so that's going to be the question for a choose whom you will trust, he needs to make a choice to see who he will trust. Well, the first message is found in chapter seven, verses three through nine, chapter seven, verses three through nine. And we see here the child is Isaiah, his child. And it says in verse three, and the Lord said to Isaiah, go out to me, he has you and she air just shoes, your son at the end of the conduit and the upper pool on the highway to the washers field, and say to him, Be careful, be quiet, do not fear. And do not let your heart be faint, because of these two smoldering stumps of firebrands, at the fierce anger of resonance, Syria, and the son of Himalaya, because Syria with Ephraim, and the son of Himalaya has devised evil against you saying, Let us go against Judah and terrified and let us call crud for ourselves and set up the son of tibial, as king in the midst of it, Thus says the Lord God, it shall not stand, and it shall not come to pass. So we see in this first message, God tells Isaiah to take his son and his son literally means a remnant will return, a remnant will return, you notice that that meaning that name, there is going to have some significance for Ahaz in his situation, and I'm really not sure if it's a message of hope, or a message of doom. He tells the message here, the message that He gives he has is do not fear Siri and Aetherium. You see how he described them, they're like smoldering brands. And so when the fire has gone out, and you have the sticks in the woods, the smoldering is what's left, but that's soon dying out isn't. He says, Do not trust them, they may appear like a mighty fire, but they are smoldering out, they are to lose their strength, do not trust in them. And he says, Take your son, a remnant will return. I don't know if that's telling Ahaz that you're going to be wiped out and all that's going to be left as a written. There's Doom coming or take courage. At least there will be a remnant left. But either way, you see the message is going to be clear for Ahaz Do not fear Syria, and Aetherium. I'm going to get my water over here if y'all don't mind. I meant to bring it up with me and I didn't.

Jeremy Sweets  09:02
Alright, so the second message we see is in the next few verses, in verses 10 through 17. And here there is another child that is used, and the question that is put to Ahaz. Or God says to a has asked for a sign. If this is a message that you're not fully trusting, then ask for a sign. But he has refuses and says you should not put the Lord your God to the test. He appears to have the full way to faith on his quarter. I don't need a sign. But it's really just the opposite. To put God to the test is to demand God give you a sign in spite of what he has told you. But that's not the scenario that's unfolding here. This is God saying, I'll provide for you evidence, ask whatever you will, I'll show you. I'll give you what you want to see. And he says no, I don't don't want to see it. Why does he do that? Well, he's already made up his mind about what he's going to do. Now, we don't read it here in the passage that we're going to be reading. But he has actually, instead of siding with Syria and Aetherium, he sends money to Syria to be able to help him out. And you'll notice that the end of the reign of Pekka and resin was 732. That's when a Syria destroys Damascus and Syria is no more and Aetherium very shortly will be no more. So Ahaz doesn't know that at this time as far as the end of these two nations, but that's exactly what Isaiah is telling him. He says, Ask for a sign. He says, No, I'm not going to ask for a sign. And so you'll notice in verse 14 of chapter seven, Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign, Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and she'll call his name, Immanuel. Immanuel. Ahaz is not going to ask for a sign, but he's going to be given a song. And that sign is a child that is born of a virgin, and that child's name will be Emmanuel, God with us, God with us, that will be his sign. Well, as we move along, we see a further message in between here in chapter seven, verses 18 through 25. It simply says there the message is failing to trust God will lead to destruction. There are consequences for failing to trust in God, and he has is trying to avoid destruction, but he's choosing the wrong path. And he's going to get the very thing that he feared. But as we move on to chapter eight, verses one through four, we see another sign that's given here, notice what it says, The Lord said to me take a large tablet and write on it and common characters belonging to the hare shall all Hosh boats, and I will get reliable witnesses Uriah the priests and Zacharia, the son of Jubair Archaia, to attest for me, says in verse three, and I went to the prophetess and she can save them more son. Then the Lord said to me, call his name here shall all Hosh bonds for the before the boy knows how to cry, my father or my mother, the wealth of Damascus and the spoil of scenario will be carried away before the king of Assyria. Now this long name is really the words swift to the plunder speedy to the the spoils. And so that name means that the spoils are going to be gotten very quickly. He says before the child is even grown for is able to babble words of mother and father. The spoils or the wealth of Syria and Aetherium are going to be quickly gotten Aetherium and Syria are headed toward destruction, do not fear them, do not fear them, they are headed to destruction. And so we see that a uses this child to relay this message in verses five through 10. Another message says that a Syria will come upon a has or Syria will come upon Damascus and Sumeria not only will they face destruction and soon die out but a Syria is going to be what causes that to come about. Okay. Next verses we see her in chapters eight verses 11 through 22. And this is where we get the main choice that he has has to make. Notice if you would starting in verse 11.

Jeremy Sweets  13:45
For the Lord spoke to us to me with a strong hand upon me and warn me not to walk in the way of this people saying, Do not call conspiracy, all that this people calls conspiracy, and do not fear what they fear nor being dread. Notice verse 13, but the Lord of hosts Him you shall honor His holy, let him be your fear and let him be your dread. And he will become a sanctuary and stone have a fence in Iraq of stumbling to both houses of Israel, a trap and a snare to the inhabitants of Jerusalem, and many shall stumble on it. They shall fall and be broken, they shall be snared and taken. Notice the choices laid out very clearly. Do not fear what people fear. Do not fear Damascus and Sumeria Do not fear these mighty armies of men, but who should you fear? Fear God? Consider him as holy. Let him control your your fear, your trust, the one that you recognize as being all powerful. And notice what he says as we continue after verse 15. In verse 16, bind The testimonies seal the teaching among my disciples, I will wait for the Lord who is hiding his face from the house of Jacob and I will hope in him. Behold, verse 18, I and the children whom the Lord has given me our signs and portance in Israel from the Lord of hosts, who dwells on Mount Zion, these children and their names very clearly our teachings are signs. They're pointing to something. And that message should have been clear to Ahaz trust in God, not in Iran, and Israel, choose God and not man. Well, we have one other child that's mentioned. As you look in chapter nine and verse one, you see that the path that is laid before Ahab is very clear. You can choose darkness and gloom and destruction, or light, there's a light that will shine forth in the darkness. And notice what it says in chapter nine in verse one, where there will be no gloom for her who was in anguish. In the former time he brought into content the land of Zeb Yulin and the land of NAFTA live in the latter time he has made glorious the way of the sea, the land beyond the Jordan galleys of the nations. And I hate to go back and read this out of order, but verse 22 of the last chapter, ties in that picture of light and darkness, they will look to the earth but behold, distress and darkness, the gloom of anguish, and they will be thrust into thick darkness. And so you see, this path of trusting and man is thick darkness, but what is offered is light, is light. It says in verse two, the people who walked in darkness have seen a great light, those who have dwelt in a land of deep darkness on them, has light shone. And as we come to verses six and seven, we see another child that is used to relate this message. It says, For das a child is born, to us a son is given, and the government shall be upon his shoulder, and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counselor, Mighty God, Everlasting Father, Prince of peace, of the increase of His government and of peace, there will be no end, on the throne of David and over his kingdom, to establish it and to uphold it with justice and with righteousness. From this time forth and forevermore. The zeal of the LORD of hosts will do this. Arrogant he has set in his ways, refusing to listen or heed a sign or even ask for a sign from God, as evidence is given these children and all their innocence to tell him trusting God, to relay that message. And this, this one here, this child, this future child, is one that will bring light in to darkness. I believe this future tiled actually extends beyond the lifetime of Ahaz. But it really has the same message the same importance, as it did for Ahaz. And has that same message for the people in the New Testament. And for us, that future child would be Jesus Christ. And we see that reference. For example, in Isaiah chapter seven, in verse 14, there's total of a virgin that will give birth to a child we shall call him a manual or God with us. When we open our Bibles to Matthew chapter one, we see that Mary was

Jeremy Sweets  18:43
pregnant, and she was pregnant by the Holy Spirit's, her husband sought to put her away thinking that she had been unfaithful, but an angel appeared and said, that you should not do that. For it says in verse 21, of Matthew one, she will bear a son and you shall call his name Jesus, for he will save his people from their sin. All this took place to fulfill what the Lord had spoken by the prophet, Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear son and they should call his name Immanuel, which means God with us, this child would be the representation of the very picture itself, of God dwelling with his people, of God dwelling with his people. We see in Matt and Isaiah chapter nine, verses six and seven, that there it references a child to be born a son, that will be given. We also see that of this son, it says that he shall be called or his name shall be, and it lists things it would do us well to study in depth each one of these words, four names with a descriptor and a name there an adjective and name, Wonderful Counselor. Here it says of this child will be wonderful Counselor, the one that is able to direct the one that is wonderful in his nature, one that will create all in others, this is the son to be given, mighty God. One who is God has the character of God who is mighty, and powerful. And that was needed in light of the question, the choice that he had to make, choosing you will trust and whose power will you put your faith ever lasting father, hear this son to be born will have the very character will have the rare resemblance of the Father, He will be ever lasting. Without beginning without end, he will be eternal. And also Prince of Peace, you'll be a ruler. There'll be a ruler not of violence, but of peace. And we see all those things found in Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ is the one that would be the son that would be given. That would bring lights into the world of darkness, that would rule on the seat, the throne of David. Without in it is Jesus Christ, you'll notice that each one of these references here are from the very beginnings of the Gospels when Jesus is born. This is what is announced. This is what is display. In John chapter one verses one through three, in the beginning was the Word and the Word was with God and the Word was God. The same was in the beginning with God. All things were created through Him and without Him was not anything made. That was may notice what it says about the word. The word was in the beginning. The Word was with God, and the Word was God. Here this word is divine. But not only that, it goes on to say that in Him was life and life was the light of men. The light shines in the darkness in the dark, darkness has not overcome it. You see the message in the point, this word, this God, this child, would be a light in the darkness. And that's exactly what it says in Isaiah chapter nine. In verse 14, it says in the Word became flesh, Jesus Christ took on flesh, God took on flesh, he was the son, the child, that is the future child have Isaiah nine, and Luke one verses 32 and 33, Luke one, verses 32 and 33. There it says, He will be great and will be called a Son of the Most High, and the Lord God will give to him the throne of his father David, and he will reign over the house of Jacob forever, and of His kingdom, there will be no end. Did you catch that what it said of Jesus Christ, He is the Son of the Most har. And the Lord God will give him the throne of his father, David. And the rain that it will have over the house of Jacob will be forever, it will have no end, there will be no end. Yes. When we look at the child that is used in the message of Isaiah, chapter seven through nine, we see that that ultimately points to Jesus Christ. And the stakes are the same. Choose whom you will trust make a choice between God or man.

Jeremy Sweets  23:49
Well, as I suggested, we have the same choice to make today don't we may not be facing armies, asking us to join them to see who we're gonna trust, we may not be in the exact same situation of Ahaz. But we still have a choice to make. And we must choose whom we will trust today as well. So what can we do and what can we learn from what we see in Isaiah chapter nine. One of the things that Isaiah tried to stress to to Ahab's is that your choice has consequences. If you choose Pekka and resin, you're going to be headed into the same destruction that they will face if you choose to trust them. Now if you choose to trust in Assyria, you're going to face their same demise as well. The choice is not between which man should you trust, but rather should you trust God? But the important thing to see here is that those choices have consequences. They lead in directions. And the same thing is true today. If you would choose man To trust in man, then you will have the fate of man so to speak. You will choose his direction. Bible says For the wages of sin is death, the man that chooses himself or another man and stead of God chooses death. In Matthew chapter seven, Matthew chapter seven, we see these two ways laid out as well. In verses 13 and 14, there it says, Enter by the narrow gate for the gate is wide, and the way is easy that leads to destruction. And those who enter by it are many for the Gators narrow in the way is hard that leads to life. And those who find it are few. The Bible teaches us there's two paths, there's two directions, and they have two ends. One is destruction. And one is life. That's the same. Same thing true for us today, isn't it? That applies to us. We have to make a choice between good and evil between God and man or anything else. And that choice has consequences. So secondly, we need to examine the evidence, examine the evidence. I think God wants us to trust him. Now, I don't think God wants us to have a blind faith. You know, some people think that's all faith is it's a, it's a blind leap. It's a step into the unknown. Just simply close your eyes and, and hope that this is the right way. But I don't think that's what, that's the kind of faith that God wants us to have. God wants us to have evidence, and he gives us evidence so that we might have a rational faith. Now, the evidence he gives us is not absolute proof. It's not 100% guarantee, but it's reasonable in the direction that it points us to. And he wants us to examine the evidence, examine the evidence. That was really the the choice that was given to Ahaz wasn't, I will provide for you evidence. God says, I will help you basis upon what you can see and understand. And he has says I don't want that. I'm good. I wonder if we do the same thing today. Sometimes? No, I've got a college degree. I don't need any of this evidence, or I've already made up my mind. I don't need to listen to this or hear any of this. We need to examine the evidence. You know, in the New Testament, we see that the the the preachers of the gospel provided evidence we see in Acts chapter 17, verse three, that Paul when he went into the city there that he went to the synagogue, and it says that he was explaining and giving evidence that the Christ must suffer and die. You see, he believed in evidence and use that evidence to point people to Christ. In First Peter chapter three, First Peter, chapter three and verse 15, it says, But honor in your hearts, Jesus Christ as Lord, and honor him, his holy always being prepared to make a defense to anyone who asked you for a reason for the hope that is in you. provide evidence, give a reason for those things. If we're to choose whom we will trust, I think we need to examine the evidence today as well. God wants us to have a reasonable and reasoned faith and examine that evidence put our faith and trust in Him.

Jeremy Sweets  28:52
Not only that, but we need to be humble like a child. It's interesting to me and fascinating even that Isaiah and the Lord uses a child to relay such an important message. Many times we dismiss children don't we were like the apostles. We got the big people table, the children need to move to the side for a bit. In Matthew chapter 18, verses one through four. Notice what it says. At that time the disciples came to Jesus saying, Who is the greatest in the kingdom of heaven, and calling to him a child he put him in the midst of them and said, Truly I say to you, unless you turn and become like children, you will never enter the kingdom of heaven. whoever humbles himself like this child is the greatest and the kingdom of heaven. Children have a great deal to teach us. Broadmoor should be one of the most humble congregations around shouldn't I say that half in jest but half. In all seriousness, these children are a blessing. I know. There are many prayers and many Thanksgiving Given the God for what we have here, as a congregation, and it is a blessing, but we need, we need also to learn, I hope we are learning from our children, this very lesson that Jesus provides this idea of humility, and innocence. And that's needed in our relationship with God. And I hope we see and understand that we need to keep learning that message over and over again, don't we be humble. Ahaz was arrogant. And he needed to learn from a child. And if we ever face arrogance in our life, as I'm sure we all stare arrogance in the face and have to make a choice. I hope we look to children, and we become humble like a child. Not only that, but we need to make the choice of choosing to trust God or man. We need to choose God in a dark world. In Psalm 27. In verse one, it says, The Lord is my light and my salvation, whom shall I fear? The Lord is the stronghold of my life, of whom shall I be afraid? God is my strength and my light. He's all that matters. He's more powerful than anyone else. We need to choose the fear God over religious authorities are the thoughts or opinions of men. In John 12, verses 42 and 43. It says, Nevertheless, many even of the authorities believed in Jesus, but for fear of the Pharisees, they did not confess it, so that they would not be put out of the synagogue. For they love the glory that comes from man more than the glory that comes from God. This is a challenging verse. I don't know if you feel the weight of this or not. But we need to put God in his opinion and his thought above all else. Regardless of what anyone else would think about whether we're doing something right or wrong, we need to go to the Scriptures, and with our hearts, humble and honest, do what it says is we understand God to be telling us, and there may be others that would disagree with you, there may be others that would condemn you, there may be others that look down upon you. And you shouldn't take that lightly. We should try to come to as much agreement is possible as we can with other people, but at the end of the day, we serve God. And it's his opinion that matters above all else. And that's that's a challenge. Because we can be like these Pharisees that fear the rejection are the thoughts of the judgments of others, and that can become overwhelming, and that can overshadow what is truly important. So let us choose God over religious authorities are the thoughts and opinions of anyone else. Let us choose God over peer pressure. In Galatians one, verse 10. He says, Paul says, For him, I now seeking the approval of man or of God, or my tray trying to please man, first, still trying to please man, I would not be a servant of Christ. Don't allow others to influence us in our relationship with God or steer us away. Don't try to please man above God, serve God and serve Christ above all else. We need to choose God over threats of physical harm.

Jeremy Sweets  33:35
He has was afraid for his life, he feared what Peckin resin could do to him. And he feared I'm sure the Assyrian army and what they might do to him if he chose the wrong saw. The Bible says that we need not fear what can happen to us physically. We are blessed in this country to be able to openly worship God we came here without any pretense without any thought of being stopped by the government. I'm freely speaking what I have to say we're allowed to, to worship God as we choose in this country, and that's a blessing. But if the day should come where that is not the case, let us choose God and not man. In Matthew 10, in verse 28, it says, Do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. rather fear him who can destroy both soul and body inhale. Fear God above all else, even at the cost of our life. Because after all, what is our life? It's a vapor. It's momentary, and there is an eternal weight of glory that waits us with God. Let us choose God. Let us trust him and not me. So the lesson is yours whom you will trust. If you're here this morning and you're not a Christian, you have a choice to make. Well, you choose God and His ways or we continue to choose the sin that you've lived in and practice. God has provided an avenue or a way so that we might choose him, giving us his son, his perfect Son. One thing I left out and forgot to mention was, Jesus was born as an innocent baby. But you know, he never lost that. Even as an adult, he was innocent. And He gave His life, His sinless life on the cross for us, so that we might have forgiveness of sins. And so we must believe that Jesus is the Christ repent of our sins, confessing Him is the Christ, and being baptized in the water for the forgiveness of sins. Once we've done that, we've begun our wall, our Christian life, a lifelong commitment. And I extend that invitation to anyone here that's considering becoming a Christian, there is no better choice. There is no better decision that you can make than to follow Christ. If you're here this morning and you're a Christian, you've made that commitment before but you're not living as you should. You also need to make your life right, make changes. Reach out to the group here by coming forward and confessing your sin or asking for prayers, or to another individual that you trust here. Whatever it is, do whatever you need to do to make your life right. There's anyone subject to the invitation, please come as we stand in scene at this time.
