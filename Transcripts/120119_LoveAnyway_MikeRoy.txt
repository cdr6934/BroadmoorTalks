Buddha sure good to have an opportunity to come together and praise our great and awesome God He is worthy of all praise and glory and honor. We've had a good day already. Appreciate Jeremy's lesson this morning. And we want to again challenge our minds and our hearts to develop the mindset of Christ. Appreciate those songs that Marshall led for us this evening is he'll go go along with my lesson this evening. You know, in preaching, we're always looking for sermon ideas that come from the most unusual sources. So as Sarah with JD and Sarah and Oliver, this this weekend, I was looking at JV socks. And it had a slogan on there says, Love anyway. And I had just seen that on a package that my wife had sent to the house. And that thought, got my intention. So forcibly, I said, I'm going to work it into a lesson. And so that's what I'm going to be doing this morning or this evening, is talk about this idea of love. Anyway. Well, invariably, as I asked some questions about this, my kids know more about all these groups that are out there than than I do. And so Sarah Tomi says, Yeah, this is a remarkable group of people that basically, this organization, which is also known by pre emptive, love, will go into they go into war torn countries, to bring about peace and healing and hope and change. They minister to those of us meet who have knees that are hurting, they work on crisis, border towns, and help refugees deal with the daily stress and trauma. And knowing fully the the dangers of entering countries that are ravaged by war and persecution, abuse and poverty, they choose to love anyway. So remarkable thought to think about. So as I did some research on that I was impressed with this concept. And so I want to talk to you this evening, about the idea of loving anyway, even if you don't feel like it, even if you don't want to do that. And so that's the challenge for us this evening. That even when it's not something that we feel like we're up to helping other people speaking kindly to people who are not kind to ourselves, the challenge is for us, indeed, to learn to love anyway. And so sometimes I say in lessons that I preach, if there's one thing I hope that each of us will learn from this lesson and internalize in terms of the truth is this principle right here that love any way, no matter what's going on with how difficult, however difficult that may be to do that. I want to encourage us to do that this evening. So I basically built my lesson around this truth, which I think is echoed in Scripture. And so I'm going to basically look at some definitions of agave love, because that's really what we're talking about here. And then be looking at scriptures that basically support this principle and illustrate how we carry that out in our day to day activities. So the first thing I want to suggest to us when we talk about loving anyway, while this is a principle that's clearly taught in Scripture, you see that and so many places in Scripture in the Bible, I want to suggest to us that this describes the very essence of God. God is somebody who loves us. Anyway, in spite of our weaknesses, in spite of our failures, in spite of our rebellion against Him, He loves anyway, and is calling on us as His followers to do the very same thing. And I say in connection with that. The the concept of loving in any way should describe the character of a Christian. That is, it should describe the character of every Christian This is not for preachers or elders, Obama class teachers, or song leaders. This should describe the character of every of every Christian.

And if you think about God's character, twice in First John, chapter four, the apostle declares that God is love. And so loved is as reading some commentary, or to where some are suggesting that love is an attribute of God and maybe to some degree, that's true. But in my understanding, love isn't so much an attribute of God, it is his character, it is his essence, is who he is, from the inside out. If we're going to be like God, then we need to accept the challenge to learn to love others the same way He loves us. Let's begin with a definition because we're really talking about a coffee loving the first comment from Unger's Bible Dictionary. He said this, he said the scriptures contain no equivalent statements with respect to other qualities of the divine nature. Love is the highest characteristic of God, the one attribute in which all others are harmonious, harmoniously blended. I tend to agree with that, that love is the essence of God has been always part of his character. He's certainly God who is holy, who's compassionate and all that. But love is that predominant characteristic that caused him from time immortal, to develop a plan by which he was save us from our sin. So let's think about this for just a minute. In our culture, we have different meanings for the word love, we say I love my wife love my car, I love barbecue, and I love soccer or football. Well, obviously, those words have different meanings in each application, but in the Bible that the word generally that we are focusing on is the word agave, which is the highest type of love. So without going into a technical depth definition, basically this, this word agave or Weixin, passe Agave love, this is act of goodwill towards others, regardless of who they are. It's an act of the will is not an emotion. We live in a world where love is an emotion, I feel love this, you know, whatever the case might be. But Agave Love is an act of the will. It's a choice that we make, as Jeremy mentioned this morning and his lesson that God calls on us to make the choice, that choice, the choice to choose him, above all people to love on and serve him. Want to suggest that a god be love is displayed before both rational and irrational people. So obviously, is a God who loves us. He's He's, he's looking for a reasonable response from us. But he loves people who are irrational, illogical, immoral. And again, this is the nature of a GFI love. And that's why we're challenged to love anyway, in spite of whoever it is that we're dealing with a yen that's expressed towards evil and sinful people. So this is the type of love that we're talking about. And the challenge that I want to present to us and leave with each of us this evening is the is the challenge to learn to love anyway, if it's very hard to hold, again, as we've just looked at the, this definition here, this is illustrated in Scripture. For example, in Romans chapter five, verses six through eight, Paul said, For while we were still helpless, at the right time, Christ died for the ungodly, for one will hardly die for a righteous man, though perhaps for the good man, someone would even dare to die. But God demonstrates His own love toward us. And that while we were yet sinners, we were hostile to God, we were opposed to him, Christ died for us. This is the type of love that we're talking about. And this is the nature of what we sometimes call a copy love, so that while while we were still in our sins, Christ died for us. And again, you look at scripture, over and over again, we see the nature of this love that we're talking about is it's an act of goodwill, it's being willing to take risks, to help others to save souls to meet the physical needs of others. And there are a lot of scriptures that we could look at, but one of them that we want to look at actually, let me just go here to turn to First Corinthians chapter 13. And just we'll begin reading the first few verses over here they look we'll look at the text on the screen. But in First Corinthians chapter 13, which is the classic

Mike Roy  08:52
text dealing with what love really is, and especially a copy, love this what Paul says over here, and First Corinthians chapter 13, verse one, he's he said, If I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, but do not have love, I have become a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal, if I have the gift of prophecy in no all mysteries and all knowledge and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but do not have love, I am nothing. If I give all my possessions to feed the poor, if I surrender my body to be burned, but do not love, do not have love, it profits me nothing. Now he goes on to talk about the characteristics of love. So again, when we're talking about a God paid Love is the highest form of love that we can, we can practice. It has a objective characteristic. So and look at the following verses. So if we're going to be people who love anyway, because that's the challenge. He says that love is patient. Now if I'm not patient with my family or friends or customers that I'm not practicing Love, Love is patient. Love is kind is not jealous, love does not brag and is not arrogant, does not act on becomingly It does not seek his own is not provoked, does not take into account a wrong suffered, how many times we think about things that you may have done to others or others have done to you. And we think that they I remember when brother soso said this and such and such to me 20 years ago. Love doesn't keep a log book doesn't take, it doesn't keep that record. And it says it does, does not rejoice in unrighteousness, but rejoices with the truth. And look at verse seven, says it bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things, let's just kind of take those one of the time briefly. So the first thing he says about love, if we're going to love anyway, then these are the characteristics that will be manifested in our lives. So he says that love bears all things, think about that for just a moment. So love bears with the immaturity that is often characteristic of children, it puts up with a thoughtless or unfaithful spouse, it puts up with all the stress and strain of caring for aging parents or in laws, even when they might have dementia or Alzheimer's. And as most of us know, sometimes parents can be very mean to their adult children who care for them. But the character, the character of love, is that it bears all things it puts up with jealous co workers and the list goes on and on and on. But the point I'm saying here is that love bears all things. There's nothing that love will not bear it plus a choice. We choose to love or we choose not to love. And so when we say love anyway, that's that's no tall, no small task. So love bears all things. Love believes all things. How many times do we question somebody's motives? And I say I don't think he really sincere. She's really sincere. And how many times in our lives that we wish that we would believe what somebody has said to us, Oh, love, believes all things it hopes of being so even when there's no evidence of change. And it's almost overwhelming to bear up under the circumstances. Love hopes for change and hopes for improvement. And then he says that love endures all things. Even when it doesn't look like there's any possibility of change, or reconciliation or improvement, whatever the situation situation might be. After everything has been tried and no success. He's becoming love, in doors, all things, it's hard for us to get our arms around that get our mind around it. So when we talk about loving anyway, this is what we're talking about doing things that are difficult.

Mike Roy  13:14
In spite of the challenges that we face, verse eight, just as He we're not going to go to that text per se. It says here that that love never fails. So it's a reminder of the power of love. So think about that. There's just so many different applications, but but we will choose to love anyway. That means we're going to be very patient, very forbearing non judgmental, we're going to put up with almost any difficulty for the benefit of somebody else to help a family relationship. help take care of family members to save souls and think while we're thinking about saving souls, how many times do we think about I want to talk to my, my co worker, or maybe some family member that you want to reach for the gospel and or somebody that you know the community and you're afraid to say something to them because they might be offended by what you say. They might view us as self righteous. The response to that is love anyway. Well, anyway, who cares if they think you're self righteous? Jesus wasn't concerned with that. He wasn't concerned with that. They preached it anyway. They shared the gospel anyway. And so think about that in terms of evangelism. Think about somebody that you want to reach, again, could be a co worker, a neighbor, a friend, a family member, whatever the situation might think. Because

Mike Roy  14:33
love it at this level, is willing to endure hardship, endure some any type of mistreatment so he has a very practical application for us, as we think, think about reaching out to those who are lost in sin. So let's continue to look at this the nature of love and and and how we should practice that. Again, we're just focusing our minds receiving around a singular thought of loving Anyway, Matthew chapter five, and verses 43 through 48, this quit Jesus says at the conclusion of chapter five, you have heard that it was said, You shall love your neighbor, and hate your enemy. But I say to you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, so that you may be the sons of your Father who is in heaven, for he makes his sun rise on the evil and on the good, and sends rain on the just and on the unjust. For if you love those who love you, what reward Do you have? Do not even attacks collectors do the same. And if you greet only your brothers, what more are you doing than others? Do not even the Gentiles do the same? You therefore must be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect. So Jesus is challenging us as disciples of his as followers of Christ, to practice love in a remarkable level. It's interesting in verse 43, he's talking to the Jewish, his disciples maybe surrounded by Jewish leaders, the Pharisees and all those people in what in what did they say? He said to them, basically, you have heard that we said, You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy. You know, what's interesting about that, that was never taught in Scripture. They never taught to hate their name, hate their enemy. It told actually Old Testament to love the enemy, but they had twisted God's word around. But he had a point I make over here. Understand that this is a well known text of scripture. But it is very difficult to get to practice these things. But isn't this what Jesus is telling us to do in this passage, when he said to love your neighbor, Love your enemies, pray for those who persecute you. He's telling us to love them anyway. Again, that's the challenge. And it's not an easy thing to do. But the the power of love enables us to do that to change our mindset as we seek to serve God. So as you look through the New Testament, at the the various passages that deal with love, they challenge us to, to, to express love to those around us, even those people who are unlovable, even people who are hostile towards us, even people who might hate us. So remarkable type of love, but almost suggest to you is we think about how Jesus said that the world would know that he that we are His disciples, He basically said that if he would love any way, we would be able to show people that we are His followers, and John chapter 13, verses 34 and 35, Jesus of this new commandment I give to you, that you love one another, even as I have loved you, that you also love one another. And then he says, By this, all men will know that you are my disciples, if you love anyway, right? If you if you have love for one another, we understand the challenge. Sometimes as human beings, we're not always lovable people, not always kind people, not always reasonable people, but in especially within the body of Christ. And one thing we're thankful here, Broadmoor that we have a love and patience and forbearing attitude towards one another. We have we share the same goal of doing a survey God doing His will. But as how many times within churches, do fights arise and division takes place because we're not practicing this type of love. And so that is the challenge that we need to show love towards one another. So when you look at this passage, again, this reminder, then we're not going to convince the world around us that we're really followers of Christ. If I can quote lots of Scripture, it is important. It's the quote Scripture in the talk about the upcoming Baba class on Wednesday. But it's not how much I know of God's word, and how many good deeds I do in my life, that people will know that we are followers of Christ, if we are loving people, we love one another. And it's just as an aside, when my mom has been going to church up in Rhode Island, over the last couple of years, there was a division, something happened, somebody upset with the preacher. Anyway, a split took place. And the good news is they just now have begun to get back together.

Mike Roy  19:24
So the other group is basically kind of dissolved, which is a wonderful thing. But as I've tried to talk to my brother, who's not a member of the Lord's church, trying to teach him the gospel for years and years, the very thing he was saying, like well, how in the world can you expect everybody is divided world to get along? If you see a group like this, God's people, and they separate, and it's a valid point. And in this case, I'm glad to say that the group here at lincoln rhode island has come back together, but the way that the world knows that we're followers of Jesus is you We love any way, when we overlook our weaknesses and differences, again, not compromising doctrine, we're going to be in full agreement with what God's Word teaches. But when we love when we love one another, which basically means that we're going to be we're going to love each other. We love any way in spite of differences that we might have some times as we seek to do God's will. So let me just add another thought. Actually, another passage I want to look at Matthew chapter 22, Jesus, in Matthew chapter 22, lays down the greatest commands in Scripture, he was challenged by the Pharisees, the religious leaders, basically in verse 34. Jesus has silenced these people, a lawyer saw him tested him with a question was cheesy, he said, Teacher, which is the great, or the greatest commandment in the law. He said to him, You shall love the Lord your God, with all your heart and with all your soul, and with all your mind, this is the great and foremost commandment. So the first commandment in all of Scripture is to love the Lord our God, with all of our heart with all our soldiers, all of our mind with all of our strength in the second commandment, he said, is to love your neighbor. Love your neighbor. But he says, Love your neighbor, as you love yourself. So again, another practical challenge in our listeners, even before we bring this to a close, is the challenge

Mike Roy  21:36
to love yourself. Anyway. They say, Well, Mike, you don't understand. I've made so many blunders and mistakes and failures in my life, I said, I understand I've done the same thing. We all have. And and when we sometimes look around, in different people, we compare ourselves we don't seek to measure up to others around us. And we say things like, you know, but Mike in this day, and I struggled with, with weaknesses with shortcomings with sins, guess what? I do, too. We all do. And so when when Jesus says, Love your neighbor, as you love yourself, he's saying that in order to love our neighbor properly, you have to love yourself properly. No, you don't elevate yourself, you know, fill yourself with pride. But when you've made blunders in life, you put yourself in the category of all of God's people from Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob and David and Peter and everybody else were in the ground is level, at the foot of the cross. When we talk about loving anyway, that means one of the things that we've got to do, you got to love yourself. You gotta love yourself, in spite of your failures, you trust God's grace as you seek to, to do His will. And so again, that's just another, I think, a practical lesson that we need to learn and put into practice in our lives. But one of the verse I want to look at this evening, and First John chapter three, verses 16, through 18, the challenge of love is not talking about it. And I was talking with JD over the last couple days about how often preach on the subject of love and journey, you can look through his files. And but when it's all said and done, this is the supreme command. And we need to preach out with some frequency, but we have to practice it. So in First John chapter three, verses 16, through 18. The Apostle says this, by this, we know love that he laid down his life for us, and we ought to lay down our lives for the brothers. So that's what it means to love anyway, even if it's not convenient, even if it's not easy, even if it's very difficult. When you study through the scriptures in the read of the perfect Titus, who has risked his life for the gospel, and for Paul, these people who put their lives on the line, in order to spread the gospel to save souls. So this is the this is the nature of love. And that's why we talk about loving anyway. Then he said in verse 17, but if anyone has this the world's goods and sees his brother in need, yet closes his heart against him, how does God's love abide in him? The universe a team is a little children. Let us not love in word, or talk, but indeed and truth. Again, it's relatively easy for me or anyone else to priests this type of lesson, challenging us to love anyway. But the challenge is to put that into practice and I trust that we do that and we will continue to do that as we seek to be followers of Jesus Christ. I appreciate your attention this evening. The challenge I want to leave leave with each of us is this challenge. There's learn to be like Jesus Christ and love anyway back if you can put that slogan in your notebook and your phone, your iPad. It's a it's a powerful truth to live by. When You find yourself facing difficulties and challenges or difficult people in your life. Love them. Anyway, that's exactly what God did for you. And that's what he calls on us to do for each other theny here this evening, who need to respond to the invitation we invite you to come over stand and sing the song
