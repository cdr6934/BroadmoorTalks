It's always a joy to come and worship God, as we're doing this morning. It's good to see so many with us. And we remind ourselves that this is not a social activity. But we're here to praise God to honor him to do his will, to speak His word. Appreciate the songs that chants lead for us this morning, I do want to address the subject relating to the home, in fact, of all the institutions that God has made. The home is the oldest one. The marriage relationship was designed by God to be the building block of society. all of human history is built on the home that God designed. And because of skyrocketing divorce rates, and more and more people choosing to live together outside of marriage, the home has been crumbling. The very foundation a very institution that God Himself designed is in shambles is ruined because of a disrespect towards God's word, and a failure to heed his his warnings. And because of the importance of the marriage relationship and the increase of divorce, we need to preach on this subject. More often than we do. I try to be balanced in my preaching. And as I've reflected on this particular subject, it seems like it's been quite some time since I've talked about the issue of marriage and home and family and divorce. I have to preach it because that's part of God's will. And, and not only is divorce widespread in our country, it's also becoming more and more common among members of the Lord's church. And so we we've got to realize the dangers that we face again, appreciate those songs that that chance led calling on us to develop greater holiness, greater faithfulness to God. And so the real sense of conviction, I want to talk to you about the marriage relationship. And the the problem of the even divorce among Christians. It's not the popular kind of topic that we like to look at, but we have to talk about it, we have to look at God's word. So my lesson is titled, biblical marriage, for better for worse for life. And we have a lot of young people in our congregation here at Broadmoor, who will be making this decision at some point in their lives. And I want to say next to becoming a Christian, I believe it's the most important decision of your life. I'm thankful for the choice I made almost 30 years ago, I wanted to marry somebody who's going to help me get to heaven, who had helped me raise godly children. And I want to say to our young people, as you contemplate marriage at some point, that you want to marry someone that you can look up to spiritually don't look, don't marry somebody who's going to pull you down. And so we get a lot of godly young people in the congregation thankful for the godly parents, I had the opportunity this morning, if you thought it was a wall this morning, I was teaching Carol's class because she was sick. So I was teaching these young kids Braden, and Ava and all of them and how refreshing it is, to see the knowledge and the understanding they already have of God's word at such an early age. So that was refreshing opportunity for me, but I want to talk about biblical marriage and again, understanding that by God's design, marriage is a permanent union. And so let's talk about this important subject as we seek to respect God in His Word. I put together five points to this lesson. And these are just my own personal thoughts. Sometimes I gather outlines from other sources, but as I reflected on this particular subject, these are just my thoughts I wanted to share with you this morning. The first point I want to make very plainly is to suggest that God's design is for marriage to be a permanent, lifelong commitment. Look with me in Genesis chapter two, if you've got your Bibles, open or your iPad, whatever you're using, look at this. This text with me in Genesis chapter two.

Mike Roy  04:12
Again, well known passage of scripture that most of most of us are familiar with, for Genesis chapter two. In verse 18, God placed Adam in the garden to dress it to keep it. And in verse 18, the Lord God said, it is not good for the man to be alone, I will make him a helper suitable for him. out of the ground, the Lord God formed every beast of the field and every bird of the sky, and brought them to the man to see what he would call them. And whatever the man called the living creature that was his name. The man gave names to all the cattle and to the birds of the sky, and to every beast of the field. But for Adam, there is not found a helper suitable for him. So the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man and he slept, and he took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh. at that place, the Lord God fashioned into a woman, the rib from which he had taken from man and brought her to the man, the man the verse 23 said, This is now bone of my bones and flesh of my flesh, she shall be called woman because she was taken out of man. For this reason a man shall leave his father and his mother, and be joined to his wife, and they shall become one flesh. And the man and his wife are both naked and we're not ashamed. I just want you to notice again, this is well known passage of Scripture, some key phrases in this passage that we need to be thinking about, Adam says concerning the formation of E from his side, that this is now bone of my bones. So this is showing the closeness, the Unity the interconnectedness of woman to man, fact one note, my ESV bible said, this creates the closest of all human relationships, in the marriage relationship. This is the closest union that human beings can possibly experience and it's designed by God. So we see the unity, the connection, the closest the interconnectedness there, again, a key phrase there for this reason, shall a man leave his father and mother was he saying, not to honor his parents, for the man to disregard His parents No, but this is language that speaks of purpose and intention, that is, the God is calling on a man to make a break from one family, and form his own family, in some ways to give a priority to his wife and to perhaps when they children. So again, the the instruction is very plain, for this reason shall a man leave his father mother, so it's its purpose, its intention, says that again in the text, and he shall be joined to his wife, literally at that could be possibly translated, the he would be glued to her connected to her. It's the language that I think a pursuit that he is going to passionately pursue his wife in a new union. And I think it's interesting to notice in the text that God made and giving provision for Adam, who did not have a helper suitable for him, he gave one woman, polygamy was never part of God's original plan. A God through His provision allowed that to take place, but that was not part of the original design. God designed one man and one woman for life, that was his plan, and then the phrase, the two shall become one flesh. Again, this refers to the inseparable nature of this union. It is permanent, it cannot be dissolved. It is designed by God to be a life long commitment, a union that must not be broken. Jesus acknowledges that in the Gospels, Matthew chapter 19, the Pharisees always looking to trap Jesus, and some ways, came up to him in verse three and tested him asking, Is it lawful to divorce once? Why for any cause? He answered, have you not read that He who created them from the beginning made them male and female, and said, Therefore a man shall leave his father and his mother, and hold fast to his wife, and the two shall become one flesh, those are the very words that we just read in Genesis chapter two. So they know they are no longer two, but one flesh and that amazing, a man and a woman become one flesh is the most intimate, connected relationship that humans can possibly experience. And so Jesus said, they are no longer two foot two, but one flesh. What therefore God has joined together, let not man separate, we live in a culture where divorce is celebrated. It's an abuse beyond comprehension. And there's total disregard for the plain, written word of God. And so the first point I want us to notice, in this lesson this morning is to understand as we go back to the beginning and understand God's design, and that is God designed marriage to be a permanent, lifelong commitment he does give we'll look here in the lesson in just a moment, a opposite a reason for divorce based on fornication, but this is God's design that we see back in Genesis chapter two. The second point that I think we have to acknowledge is we talk about the building block of society, the marriage relationship is understand that the only basis for divorce and remarriage that Jesus allows is adultery and fornication. Again, in our culture,

Mike Roy  09:37
there's all types of reasons for divorce. In fact, after my conversion 40 years ago, and went to visit a priest with my mother, we discussed discussing the scriptures and most of you know, thankful that my mother obeyed the gospel a few years ago, but we went to see a priest talking about the Bible. We read Matthew chapter 19, which says if there's only one reason for divorce, remarriage is adultery. That's right. That's right that adultery is the only basis of divorce and remarriage. But it says in our church, we have lots of reasons why you can get divorced and remarried. Wow. This is the voice of authority. But he's not unique. They're all saying that. So let's look at this passage, a couple with me. And Matthew chapter 19. Just going back to the text that we made reference to a moment ago. Then they said to him, these Pharisees, the Jewish leaders, why then did Moses command want to give a certificate of divorce, and to send her away? He said to them, because of your hardness of heart, Moses allowed you the ESP says or permitted you to divorce your wives, but from the beginning, it was not so. And I say to you, Whoever divorces his wife, except for sexual immorality, and marries another commits adultery. So Jesus lays down very plain teaching, very strong teach, we're gonna raise the question in just a moment. Why does Jesus give such a restrictive divorce law? Why does he do that? We'll talk about that in just a moment. In Matthew chapter five, we'll be looking at the sermon on the mount here, Lord willing on Wednesday for an upcoming class. So we'll be looking at this passage in a little while. But in the Sermon on the Mount, the Pharisees, the Jewish leaders, were again trying to trap Jesus and so on. So when Jesus is teaching, sharing his kingdom teaching, he comes across one of the the ideas of that day it was also said to Whoever divorces his wife, let him give her a certificate of divorce. But Jesus in verse 32, I say to you, that everyone who divorces his wife, except on the grounds of sexual immorality, look at the language makes her commit adultery. And whoever marries a divorced woman commits adultery. So what Jesus is saying that if a person decides to to, to divorce his or her spouse, without the cause of adultery, when you send her away, because you're tired of your relationship, you're tired of the way things are going, you make her commit adultery when she decides to remarry. I think that's what the context is saying over here. So again, as we look at the marriage relationship, for better for worse for life in the stand, that the only basis for divorce and remarriage that Jesus allows is for adultery, or fornication. We raised the question, I put it this way, why does God give such a restrictive divorce law. And I think one reason that God has given us such a restrictive divorce laws that he wants us to work on this relationship. What that says is, he doesn't want us to run when things get tough. things get tough in a marriage to almost everybody. He doesn't want us to run, to head out the door, say I quit, I give up. We leave my wife and my kids is too hard. And I think God wants us to learn to understand our spouses. He wants us to learn to work through the difficulties. I think he wants us to learn to respect each other in spite of our differences. What does that book call I meant to google it yesterday, men are from Mars and Women are from Venus edit, think that's what men are from Mars. And women are from Venus. Very, very different. God made us that way. But he wants us to complement with an E one another, to make a union that is meaningful. So look at First Peter chapter three and verse seven. Peter says to these husbands, likewise, husbands live with your wives and an understanding why that's a hard thing to do. Sometimes I don't understand the emotions of my wife. I don't have to know all the ins and outs. But I am charged to understand her that women and men are different. And so Peter tells his Christian man to live with your wives and an understanding why so many times as husbands, we can be so short tempered, and so short with our wives. Why you feel that way? Why are you upset about this? You're not her. You have to understand her. That's the charge from God. God says Be understanding of her. And for man, sometimes it goes right over Hey, I understand this. Well, maybe you need to think about that some more. So God tells husbands to live with their wives in an understanding way, showing honor to the woman as the weaker vessel. She's different.

Mike Roy  14:32
There's lots of questions about what that means for the woman being a weaker vessel, but certainly I think talks about her her preciousness or frailty, like fine china. You don't just throw fine china around. You'll break it you'll destroy it. And a lot of people are hurt a lot of women are hurt in relationships because husbands do not live with their wives according to knowledge is how the old King James Version used to say that, but so God calls upon on us to live with their wives in an understanding way, and that's an ongoing thing, isn't it for all for all of us. And then I'll look at features chapter five, verse 32. We'll be looking at this later in the lesson. Paul said this, this mystery is profound. And I'm saying that it refers to Christ and the church. However, let the, let the wife let each of you love his wife as himself. And let the wife see that she respects her husband. And so when I want to suggest, as you look at this passage in Ephesians, chapter five, what we have here I'm calling the the twin platforms of marriage. It's love, and respect. And so these are foundational qualities that must be in every marriage. So in verse 33, he's telling husbands that you need to love your wife as you love yourself. He didn't say to the husband, make love with your wife that comes naturally, I think, but he's telling him this word love is a God thing. A god pay your wife, I got pot Oh, I think is the verb over here. Love your wife, selflessly. Love your wife sacrificially. Even if she's not as lovable as she once was. That's what he's saying over here. Even if she has changed in her life, even if she has put on some weight, you still love her. Even if she's put on a lot of weight, you still love her. Even if she's sick, or she's afflicted with something you still love her. There's no conditions on this. When we see marriages, Anna man walks away away from his wife and finds a thin young woman, as sinful to walk away from that commitment. And so the charge is to love your wife, in spite of imperfections. And we recognize what God is saying over here that love rises above human imperfections. And so God tells the husband to love her to love your wife to honor her to appreciate her to value her. So that's one of the part of the the the twin platform of marriage love. And then the other one is respect. So the text says that the wife must see to it that she respects her husband. So in God's plan of things in the marriage relationship, the wife is to respect to appreciate and honor her husband, and I don't see any conditions there. He's not saying you need to respect your husband, if he's hard working, or if he makes a lot of money, or if he keeps you in luxury housing. Or if he makes enough money that you can get a new car every few years that you can respect him. But if he doesn't do that, don't respect him. That's not what the text is saying over here. It's respect his position as your spiritual head. That's the place that God has given to the husband. In the marriage relationship. It may be like the presidency, the Office of the President, you might not like Mr. Trump, you might not like Barack Obama, but you respect the office, because God put individuals in a brief people to power but His purpose is, and not to necessarily meet our needs or our expectations. So God says, Honor the king, God says honored the governor. And God says honor and respect your husband needs at a twin twin platforms in the marriage relationship. The fourth point that I want us to notice this morning, again, if we talk about marriage as a foundational building block of society, God wants us to remember our vows that we made to each other. And I just put a few of these up here. For better, for worse, for richer, for poorer, in sickness and in health. And it's a lot more than this found the typical marriage vows. But I want us to remember, first of all, that the vows that we made were promises that we made in the presence of God. When I promised to love my wife, I promised to love her always, no matter what happened. And she makes this made the same promise to me. For us. It's been about 30 years. So we are a lot longer than that, which is a wonderful thing. But but this is what God wants us to remember. And so let me ask you to remember saying these things for better, for worse.

Mike Roy  19:30
for richer, for poorer, in sickness and health. What if things are worse right now? They're better is great. Oh, man, my marriage is great. Get a wonderful, cozy, loving relationship, get lots of money and security. But what if things are worse? You still honor that bound? Right? You still honor that promise? Don't you that God calls upon us to do that? What if you're struggling in your marriage? There's no out there. When we make those vows. They recorded it in the walls of heaven and garlic. expects us to honor those. What if you're poor? Now a lot of us we talk about this. We live in an affluent society and most of us are doing fairly well no matter what's going on and bills to pay and everything else we are living, in many ways a life of luxury. But what if you're not? What if you made that promise to love and honor into for richer, for poorer, and your poor are now and all your friends have lots of money have to buy new houses or whatever? And you can't do that? God says, Honor your vow. What if you're dealing with sickness for yourself or your spouse, if you're facing tough times some type of illness. So again, God wants us to remember the promises that we made in His presence. I came across this recently from James Dobson. This is a list of 11 marriage killers. And I just get his emails on a regular basis. He's done a remarkable amount of good in terms of helping the stabilize the the home relationship, but these are some of the things that he talks about some marriage killers, over commitment, and physical exhaustion just done to do too much. And we get ourselves with no energy left excessive credit, and conflict over how money will be spent money is a big issue. It caused a lot of no doubt lot of marriages and because of this problem, selfishness, what do I want? It's all about me. unhealthy relationships with in laws can be a marriage killer if we don't leave and cleave is God tells us to unrealistic expectations is another one. Sometimes people don't realize what's involved the commitment of marriage, and all sudden, they're disillusioned. I should have married somebody else I should have done something I should not get married. And so this is not realistic expectations. He said his Space Invaders is not about Star Wars and that type of thing is giving his spouse space. Sometimes there's some maybe jealousy and maybe some spouses, husbands or wives are just always looking around the corner, make sure that see what their wife is doing. There's no trust, there's no trust, they're gonna give you what your spouse face. sexual frustration in his partner, the greener grass of infidelity, a big marriage killer, business collapse. As men very often our self esteem is tied to our work. And when our business fails, if that happens, very often we say I'm out of this marriage, wrong reason. Also, he points out that business success could be a marriage killer. Why is that happened? Well, the man said, Man, I'm doing really well making lots of money, very successful, expanding, we're growing. I don't need you anymore. And the guys out the door number 10, alcohol and substance abuse, and then pornography, gambling and other addictions. So these are some marriage killers. And we gotta be on our guard brethren against letting these things seep into our hearts and minds into our houses, to stand strong against the temptations that Satan throws our way. One other point that I want to mention is the final point in the lesson. Every time we're building homes that are that are pleasing to God that are going to withstand the test of time God wants us number five, to learn to love our spouses, like he loves us. Love is really the answer is the answer. Every trial, every temptation every difficult to every marriage strain. Love is the answer. It's a proactive, the Agape type of love putting one another's interest before your own and not thinking about yourself or myself. Look at this passage in Ephesians chapter five. We're gonna go ahead and notice what Paul said over here.

Mike Roy  23:45
Ephesians chapter five and beginning in verse 22, well known section of scripture to get over there myself. So Feagins shift to five and verse 22. Paul says, Wives be subject to your own husbands as to the Lord. For the husband is the head of the wife as Christ is also the head of the church, He Himself being the savior, the body, but as the church is subject to cry, so also the wives ought to be to their husbands in everything, verse 25, Husbands, love your wives, just as Christ also loved the church and gave Himself up for her, so that He might sanctify her, having cleansed her by the washing of water with the word that He might present himself to church and all her glory, having no spot or wrinkle or any such thing, but that she should be holy and blameless. So husbands ought also to love their own wives as their own bodies. He who loves his own wife loves himself, for no one ever hated his own flesh but nourishes and cherishes it just as Christ also does the church, because we are members of His Body. For this reason a man shall leave his father and mother and shall be joined to his wife, and the two shall become flesh. First. 32 said this mystery is great. I'm speaking With reference to Christ, and the church, he's using marriage, I think to illustrate the love and the closeness that should be course in God's Church and obviously should be in a marriage relationship, verse 33. Nevertheless, each individual among you is to love his own wife, even as himself, the wife must see to it that she respects her husband. So again, you see that the charge here in Ephesians, chapter five husbands are to love their wives, just as Christ loved the church. What type of love is that? That's self sacrificial love, that self denying love, I'm going to put my wife's interest above my own interest. And again, husbands to love their wives as their own bodies. But then again, it closes with the idea of love and respect, which needs to be in the marriage relationship. So again, ultimately, God wants us in our marriages, to love our spouses the same way He loves us. I've got a long way to go. I trust that we probably all do. But that is the goal. God wants us to, to love our spouses, the same way that he loves us. And so as you wrap up the lesson and extend the invitation, it's reminder, brethren, that marriage is for better. It is for worse. And it is for life. It is as we say unto death do us part and judgment day is coming. We want to be faithful to our spouses. We want to be faithful to our Father in heaven. If there are any here this morning that needs to respond to the invitation. We invite you to come while we stand and sing this invitation song
