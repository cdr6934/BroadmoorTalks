Good evening. It's good to see everyone here tonight. It's certainly good that we could come together and worship God, I appreciate very much the songs that relent. I think they go well with what we're going to be talking about tonight. And I appreciate the fact that you're here. And I'm here to worship. Let me just say one other quick thing before I began. That is, I really appreciate David Lowe. He makes the job that the preachers do here, a lot less stressful, and getting the PowerPoint and things ready. So I'll just mention that. I wish I could say that every time because I do appreciate it. But I'll just mention that quickly. Jim said the songs too. Yeah. Okay, in literature, or speeches or even sermons, they say that the introduction is one of the most important parts. It's a vital aspect of the whole, it's when an author or speaker grabs your attention, and invite you into the work as a whole draws you in. So the introduction is extremely important. The homiletical handbook, he didn't know we preachers had a handbook Did you? The homiletical handbook states, from a practical point of view, the introduction is usually the most important part of the sermon. If we fail to capture the hero at this point, the sermon as a whole and all likelihood will fail. And you may think that's overstated. I don't know. But the point he's trying to make is, it's important how you introduce something. So how does Matthew introduce his gospel? introduces his gospel with a genealogy? How would you like for Conrad to stand up next time and begin reading a long list of names is that something that's going to grab your attention draw you in? Conrad does a good job of he uses his kids stories a lot in his high school college days to draw us in to the sermon to introduces there. So how does Matthew introduce us? Well, he does it with a genealogy. What might seem like a lousy introduction to a 21st century modern reader was not really allows the introduction at all. In fact, it was something that would have grabbed the attention for the first century Jewish audience. They held genealogies to be something that was extremely important. And so this would have, I believe, grabbed their attention. I think if we learn a little bit more, maybe it can grab our attention, as well. So I'd like to talk tonight about the genealogy of Jesus from Matthew chapter one. Fact, the biggest bulk of my lesson will come from Matthew chapter one and verse one, the first verse of Matthew in the New Testament.

Jeremy Sweets  03:01
So if we're going to look at this genealogy, it follows a very, very formatted structure. There's an introductory statement that says, The Book of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, the Son of David, the son of Abraham, and then lists the genealogy, and it does it really in three segments or sections. The first segment is Abraham to David. And that covers 14 generations, from David to the deportation which covers 14 generations, and from the deportation to Christ, which covers 14 generations. Now, you might not have to be so literal, if you were to count all the names, I'm not sure we add up exactly to all those things. Sometimes generations are skipped. But the point is that these cover three sections of the genealogy, there is also a summary in verse 17, that summarizes these things. So this is how Matthew introduces his gospel. This is how he is going to point his readers to his subject matter of Jesus. I think that this genealogy actually tells us a lot about who Jesus is. And we've been four important for the first century readers and I think it's important for us today as well. So who is Jesus? Well, first of all, Jesus is the new Genesis, the new Genesis. Notice in verse one, says, The Book of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, you could also translate that the book of the generations of Jesus Christ, you may remember from your studies of Genesis, that it is divided according to the statements the generations have. These are the generations. And so we see here that as Matthew introduces his gospel, he would have reminded his here is of the book of Genesis by saying, These are the generations or this is the genealogy of Jesus Christ, we get our name of the book Genesis from the Septuagint, which renders that word generations. Genesis. And so we see that really, if you were looking at this in Greek and would have had, this is the book of the genesis of Jesus Christ, the origin of Jesus Christ. And so we see that Matthew is intentionally harkening back to the book of Genesis, and just as the book of Genesis was a beginning, the beginning of all things, I think he is pointing to Jesus Christ as a new beginning. Certainly he ushered in a new age. And it is this that I think that Matthew points us to the book of Genesis, Jesus is a new Genesis. Furthermore, in the book of Genesis, there are 10 of these generation statements 11 If you include the duplicate of Esau, but there are 10 of the statements, and only in one case, does it say the book of the generations. And that's found in Genesis chapter five and verse one, when it talks about Adam. So I think just as Matthew is harkening back to Genesis, there may be an intentional reflection here on Adam as well. We know that other New Testament writers would refer to Jesus Christ as the last atom, there was the first atom at creation and Jesus Christ is a new or the last or completed or final atom, Jesus Christ would be a man that would come. First Corinthians 15 And verse 45, says, the first atom became a living being, the last atom became a LIFE GIVING SPIRIT. As that chapter deals with the resurrection, we see that God breathed into the nostrils of Adam, the breath of life, but Jesus Christ is one that would be the first fruits of the resurrection, and he would become a life giving spirit. In Romans five and verse 18, it says, So then as through one transgression, there resulted condemnation to all men, even so through one act of righteousness, there resulted justification of life to all men. And so we see that Jesus Christ is the last atom. So in that very first statement, fragment of a sentence, the book of the genealogy of Jesus Christ, I think we have some reminders of the book of Genesis, and it would help the hearers. And it would help us today if we would understand that. Not only that, but we see that Jesus Christ is the Savior, He is the Savior. People in the ancient world were normally assigned a single name. And then they were known by this name, and sometimes appended to that would have been their father, or maybe even their their hometown. But you would have one name, and the name of Jesus, his assigned or given name and is Jesus and Hebrew, this name would have been Yeshua, which means your way saves God saves. And it's related to the Hebrew name named Joshua, which means your way is salvation. This was the given name of Jesus, and often a name would have special significance. It would relate to what that person was to do or who they were to be. And that's true for Jesus as well. This was not a name that was simply a favorite of Joseph. This was not a family name in terms of something that Mary simply light. But this was a name that was hand picked by God, to reflect the very service that Jesus was to accomplish. When Jesus was born, his name was assigned by an angel of the Lord, because of what he would accomplish in life. In Matthew one in verse 21, it says, She will bear a son and you shall call his name Jesus, for he will save his people from their sin. Jesus was the name that he was given, because of what he would do. He would save all people. So who is Jesus, He is the Savior. And it is the book of the genealogy of Jesus or Joshua the one that will say, not only that, but we also see that he is the Messiah, the Messiah. As I mentioned, people in the ancient world were a sore sign the single name this is not Jesus first and last name Jesus Christ, but rather it is Jesus first name is given name JESUS And the title of who he is, is Jesus the Christ, the ESV reads Jesus Christ. But again, let's remember that's not his first and last name. Christ was a title that means anointed one. And it derives from the Hebrew word Messiah, which means the same thing, the one that is anointed. In Jewish history, kings, high priests, prophets are often anointed, as an initiation into their God ordained office. It was even applied to one that was not a Jew at all, one that was not a priest or or a prophet in those terms. But King Cyrus the Persian king size was called the anointed one and Isaiah 45 verse one, because he would fulfill a God ordained role in defeating the Babylonians and allowing the Jews to return from captivity. anointing was applied to really all the kings of the United Kingdom, the first Kings saw David Solomon, that you remember that David refused to shed the blood of Saul. And you remember why he said that he would not do that. He said, I will not lay my hand against him because he is the Lord's anointed. Even though Saul was trying to kill David and David had an opportunity to take his life. He recognized that Saul was fulfilling a God ordained role. He was the Lord's anointed and David refused to take his life. We see that Jesus is this Messiah, He is the Messiah. Now, as we look at the genealogy, we're going to see that, from the deportation to the time of Christ, they're developed a sense of a future Messiah, or a future hope. And it was extremely important there in this time, because they were in captivity. Now, if we look at these, the genealogy as a whole, there's really two high points there. Abraham was a high point Jews would have appreciated that that figure, David was a high point. But this third segment of the deportation was certainly not a high points. It was a low point in their history. And it was at that time, that there really began to develop this sense or with increasing clarity of a future Messiah, a future one that would come like David, that would come and deliver, come and bring salvation, come and bring newness for the people.

Jeremy Sweets  12:54
There's words like this, and you could do a whole study on this and, and maybe Kevin will bring some of these things up. I'm sorry, if I'm stepping on your toes at all, Kevin, and Psalm two in verse seven, it would be a royal sun. In Isaiah nine, verses five through seven, he would be a wonderful counselor, Eternal Father. He would be mighty God, a Prince of Peace. Isaiah 55 refers to the Messiah as a suffering servant. In Jeremiah 23 And verse five, he would be the righteous branch, the stump would come about from being cut off, but there would be a branch that would rise up and come up and would provide new life also in Zechariah. 612 refers to the branch, a servant Shepherd and Ezekiel 34. A chosen Signet reign. Hey guy to a humble King, is that Zachariah chapter nine. As we look at the genealogy, we realized that there is a long period that was a low point for the nation of Israel. But it was out of that lowness that this message of hope was really and truly proclaimed, it was announced this Messiah, the book of the genealogy of Jesus, the Christ, the Messiah, we see that Jesus is the Messiah. You also notice that Jesus is the Son of David, the son of David, the son of David is an important concept in the Gospel of Matthew. David's name occurs 17 Times and The Son of David, I believe it occurs nine times. And it's more than any other book. The son of David refers to a messianic figure, one who would perpetuate or continue to sit on upon the throne of David, the covenant that was given today If we see you, when we talk about the Seventh Son of David, we're reminded of the covenant that God made with him in Second Samuel seven. And I'll just be reading a portion of the Covenant, starting in verse 12. When your days are fulfilled, and you lie down with your fathers, I will raise up your offspring after you, who shall come from your body, and I will establish His kingdom, he shall build a house for my name, and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever, I will be to him a father, and he shall be to Me a son, and your house and your kingdom shall be made sure forever before me, your throne shall be established forever. Now there is a sense in which Solomon certainly fits some of the things that were mentioned here, we see that he was certainly the son of David, he would sit upon his throne, he would certainly build his house, the temple of the Lord. But in a fuller and richer sense, we see that Jesus Christ is the true and the ultimate Son of David, his kingdom would be established, and it would be an eternal kingdom, he would be like a son, a son to the father, his kingdom would be forever, and he would build a house that would not be destroyed by the gates of hell. And so we see that Jesus Christ is this son of David, and that would have been very important, very significant to the Jewish audience, because they were looking for they were waiting for the Messiah, the Son of David, the one that would come in and, and bring renew, that would come and triumph over that which is evil. Notice also, as we look at the genealogy, there is an emphasis upon not only being the son of David, but the fact that David is a king. And so kingship is key in the book of Matthew, and the reference to David in verse six, says, and Jesse, the father became the father of David, the king, David, the king. And so we see that Jesus Christ is the Son of David, which has reflections upon being a Messiah, and reflections upon being the king.

Jeremy Sweets  17:25
We also see that Jesus is the son of Abraham. And so we step even further back into the history of Israel. Abraham was the father of the Israelite nation, and not only that nation, but other nations as well. God also promised nation that he would have an effect not only upon his descendants, but upon all the families of the earth, and glit. on Genesis chapter 12, verses two and three, we see that after God sent Moses or Abraham in into the land of Canaan, he gave him a promise, several promises. In fact, it says that I will make you a great nation, and I will bless you and make your name great, so that you will be a blessing. I will bless those who bless you and to him who Dishonored you I will curse and in you, all the families of the earth shall be blessed, shall be blessed. Now, I think that Matthew was written by and large to a Jewish audience, and they would appreciated this genealogy. In fact, that's what you find in many of the Jewish scripture, the Hebrew Scriptures, we see genealogies, and that would have meant a lot to them. Often, they would have had to prove their ancestry was involved in legal disputes over land that would have been involved in establishing who had the rightful claim to be the high priest, many things like this, they would have used the genealogy. And so this is in many ways a very Jewish Book. Messiah is a Jewish concept that came out of their, their their writings, it came from their prophets as the prophets announced to them what God was going to bring about. But notice when we harken back to Abraham, we are extending beyond the Jewish nation, to show that Jesus Christ is not just a Jewish Messiah, although he was a Jew, and he was Messiah. But the effect of his salvation would extend beyond the Jewish nation, to all people. Abraham would have an impact upon all people of the earth. And we see that in Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ would bring blessings for all the families of the earth, no one to be excluded. And so we see just really in Matthew one in verse one and as it's further given the details of the genealogie All these things about Jesus, He is the new Genesis, the last Adam, the Savior, the Messiah, the Son of David, and the son of Abraham. I'll even mentioned to maybe I'll mention this just for norm here. Messiah, David Abraham. And then he goes back almost in key allistic fashion of the genealogy to talk about Abraham, talk about David, and then the time when the Messiah would come about. And so we see this reference here to who is Jesus, he has all these things. He has all these things. Well, let's continue. And as we look at the birth of Jesus, I think there's one more, or at least one more fundamental point we can see about who Jesus is. And I believe we can see that he is the Son of God, the Son of God.

Jeremy Sweets  20:56
Not only was he the son of Abraham and the son of David, but the text makes it clear that Jesus is the Son of God. You know, in this country, sometimes we talk about winning the genetic lottery. Have you ever heard that term? We were born into a time of prosperity. Many of us live in a time of very fortunate circumstances, we were very blessed to be born to the parents, we were to the country were words, this time of great prosperity. We're fortunate. But when we think about Jesus, in His birth, he was not just fortunate. It was not blind chance that Jesus was born when he was, but rather it was the purposeful intention of God that Jesus would come into the world at this time. We know from Galatians chapter four, verses four and five. But when the fullness of time had come, God sent forth his Son, born of a woman, born under the law to redeem those who were under the wall so that we might receive adoption as sons. It was in God's time, that He sent Jesus Christ. And we can see the development of all of these people all of these generations as it happened from Abraham to David through the deportation, and it came to Jesus Christ. But as we go further into the birth narrative, we are shown very clearly, that it is God that brought this about. Notice, first of all, that the pregnancy came about not from a human father, but by the Holy Spirit. It says in verse 18, when his mother, Mary had been betrothed to Joseph, before they came together, she was found to be chopped with child from the Holy Spirit. God was the father of Jesus Christ and a used Mary, and used her body to bring about the Savior. And so we see that she was with child from the Holy Spirit. This was the Son of God. This was it says to fulfill the prophecy in Matthew chapter one and verse 23, Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear son, and they shall call his name, Emmanuel. This was something that was ordained beforehand. It was a fulfillment of Scripture hundreds of years before that this would happen. God brought this about, it was not blind chance. It was not an accident, but this was the will of God. Notice also that when Joseph determined to put her away for indecency, what he suspected was indecency. An angel Lord appeared to him and told him the significance of the pregnancy. Notice in verse 23, Behold, the virgin shall conceive, and bear son, and they shall call his name in manual, the manual, which means God with us, Jesus Christ would be the representative, but also the representation of God on earth. There are many people throughout time or throughout the history, and particularly of the Jews that would have been called the the Son of God. And that didn't mean that they were divine. But when we come to Jesus Christ, we see something different. He was not only a representative, as many before him would have been but he was the representation, the exact representation as it says in Hebrews chapter one, he was God in the flesh. God was with people in Jesus Christ. And so we see that Jesus is the Son of God, the Son of God from this text as well. Well, very clearly. So as we look at all that I think we can learn a lot about who Jesus is. And I think it's important to see that Matthew did a very good job of introducing his gospels, he points us to these facts. But notice a few other things. And that is there are several women mentioned in the genealogy of Jesus. In fact, there are five women that play a role in that genealogy, Tamar, Rahab, Ruth, Bathsheba, and Mary. Again, this would follow Jewish customs. And normally women were not mentioned in genealogies. It was the descent from father to son from father to son, and that's normally how genealogies were recorded. And so if women were mentioned, it was they were mentioned for a specific reason or a purpose.

Jeremy Sweets  25:55
I'm not sure I know exactly the reason or purpose that Matthew has in mind. But it's interesting to note a few of the characteristics that that we see about these, these women. They were often excluded. You can particularly see this about Tamar, who was excluded from what was rightfully hers, with with the son of Judah. Judah did not provide that to Tamar, women in general was excluded from these lists, and they were not part of the genealogies in a normal fashion. And so women often were excluded often, or sometimes they were mistreated as well. And so we see this as a group that these women were excluded. They were also foreigners. Now we know that Rahab who is a Canaanite and we know that Ruth who is a mole Vitesse, we know that they were foreigners. We also suspect that Tamar and Bathsheba were foreigners as well. Tradition tells us that they were foreigners, although we don't know for certain. We know that Bathsheba was married to to a Hittite. But they may have all been foreigners. We know that foreigners were at least represented from this list. And not only that, but we see immorality that is there. Three of the women are known for having sexual scandals, or some type of past Tamar, Rahab, and Bathsheba. And so we see all of these things included in the winter, in the genealogy of Jesus. So why am I pointing that out? Am I trying to bash women here? Is that what I'm doing? Certainly, certainly not. That is not the point. When I look at the genealogy of Jesus and notice that these women are included, I think it tells us something about what Jesus came to accomplish, what Jesus came to do. And that is when we see that these women were included in the ancestry of Jesus Christ, we also can see a part of the gospel what he would accomplish, Jesus came to call those that were excluded. Jesus brought foreigners into the fold, we've already noticed that it was not just a Jewish message, but a message for all people. And those that were in moral God used to bring about His will and His purpose. And God can think can continue to use those that are immoral, that have that past he can use those people in his service. So as we look at all of these things, we see that God does not divide people or exclude people based upon their foreign nationality, based upon their gender, or based upon these things. Galatians chapter three makes this point clear. There it says, For in Christ Jesus, you're all sons of God through faith. For as many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ, there is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free. There is no male and female for you're all in Christ Jesus. And if you're a Christ, then you are Abraham's all spring airs according to promise. I think these women were included for good reason. It shows us the gospel, and what would be accomplished through the gospel of Jesus Christ. So let me conclude with some lessons. What can we learn from a genealogy? Well, I think we can learn an awful lot from a genealogy. First of all, we can learn that the Old Testament is valuable. Look how many references we have in very the very first verse of the New Testament back to the Old Testament. We need the Old Testament. It provides a basis and a foundation for who we are as Christians. It is our hurts story. It tells us about the Messiah. It tells us about all that God has done. It was written for our learning for our instruction. It was the Bible that the the people of the New Testament used to point to Jesus Christ. I appreciate so much, really this congregation, I believe this congregation sees that value. I appreciate Kevin's class that he's going to be doing on Sunday mornings looking at Christ in the Old Testament, I listened to the the live stream this morning of the class, there are so many people making comments, making connections, finding an interest in the Old Testament, I would only ask that we would continue to study the Old Testament and continue to learn from it. Without a doubt, the New Testament is important. I don't want to diminish that. But the Old Testament is valuable. I think we've learned that from the genealogy.

Jeremy Sweets  30:54
Not only that, but we find that God is faithful, God is faithful. And there was a lot of things that I could have put there. And I didn't know exactly how to word this, God is faithful, we see that throughout time, we see that as God is the God of all history. History is like putting in the hands of God, he will mold it and fashion it according to his will, he will bring about his will. And we don't have that ability or anywhere close, do we, we can barely affect the generation with just a few people around us. But God affects all of human history. God is the one that can bring these things about. It is God that can look from the beginning and bring Jesus Christ about at the right time, sending His Son into the world to save all people. God is faithful, we see that God is gracious, is loving God solve the sin problem. He saw people turning their backs on him he saw the nation of Israel turning its back on Him. And He provided a plan or a way so that people might be able to address the same problem. He provided salvation to those that were enemies. And so we see that God is gracious. He used sinners. If you look through that list, we see some of those women that we mentioned, but also many of those kings were vile and evil kings, but God would use them to bring about his purposes, and his purposes would be accomplished. God is faithful. God is powerful. God is loving God is gracious. We also say that Jesus Christ is the Messiah. Jesus Christ is the Savior. Now the book of Matthew that will further unfold. But we find that in the very first verse, Who is Jesus, He's the Messiah. He is the Savior. He is the one that was talked about of old that would bring salvation to his people, to all people. Jesus Christ is the Messiah, and we need him. Because there is no other Messiah. There is no other salvation. There is no other way by which we might be saved, other than Jesus Christ, that's what God has given to us. And so we need to, to depend on Him and rely upon him because that is the plan. That is the good news that God has given to us. Jesus is the Messiah. We also see that salvation is for all Jesus Christ is the son of Abraham, who was given the promise that he would bless all families of the earth. Salvation is not restricted to the Jewish nation. Salvation is not restricted to the wealthy, or the educating. It's not restricted to America. Tennesseans Nashvillians it's not restricted period isn't. It's for all people. It is a message for all people. It's not a national message, in terms of being restricted there. But it is a message for all people. That's something we can get behind. It calls upon the fact that we all have a common humanity. It doesn't look at us as being individuals that are special or marked apart because of our gender, because of how much we know because we were born at this time. It is a message for all people. And I think that's important. We need to keep that in the back maybe in the front of our minds. The gospel is for all that needs to shape the way we think. It needs to shape the way we interact with others. It needs to shape our attitudes about other people. You know, in this climates, people are looked down upon for their politics, people are looked down upon for their poverty, they're looked down upon if they're an illegal alien, and you can go down the list. The gospel is for all it is for all people. Let us bear that message and tell that message to everyone that we can.

Jeremy Sweets  35:25
If you're here tonight, and you're not a Christian, the gospel message speaks to you. And it offers you something. In fact, we see at the conclusion of Matthew, that he issues or Jesus issues the Great Commission, the commission that is for all people, or it was to go to all people says in Matthew 28, verses 18, through 20, All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. Go therefore, and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and the Son of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I've commanded you. Behold, I am with you always to the end of the age. We see a few things from this passage. First of all, Jesus has all authority. And so he commands, if we are disciples, we are disciples of his, he is our king. Second, we see that Jesus gives the commission to go into all nations, underscoring that fact that the gospel is for all people. It's for everyone. And so everyone needs to hear this message. It also tells us that that message should be responded to, it requires or demands a response. And so those that would accept the gospel message will be baptized into the name of the Father, the Son, the Holy Spirit, and they will commit their lives to following the teachings of Jesus all of their days, and observing everything that He has given. It also tells us that Jesus is not merely a historical figure of the past. Jesus says, I will be with you always. And that promise stands today. Jesus Christ will be with you today. With me today, with his church today. If there's someone here, that's not a Christian, you have an opportunity to obey the very commission that Jesus gave, believing that Jesus is the Christ repenting of your sins, confessing that Jesus is the Christ and being baptized in the water for the forgiveness of your sins. You can have your sins washed away. And Jesus says that he'll be with you forever. And you can have that some nights. You can have that tonight. If you're here this evening and you are a Christian and not living as you should remember that you made a commitment to follow him all of your days. So make your life right. I know this congregation be happy to pray with you or for whatever your knee if you're subject to the invitation, please come as we stand and sing at this time.
