Thank you Jesse for those songs. If you want to be opening up to Colossians chapter three, that's where we're going to be studying, spending the rest of our time Colossians three.

Conrad Harkrider  00:26
When I was 10 years old, there was something really big that happened with our family. My dad got a new job. And that job was in a different city. And so we had the decision to make my parents, whether they were going to accept it and move to a new place, or stay where we were, at the time we were living in Denver, Colorado, where I had lived my entire life, but they decided that the opportunity was good enough. And so we moved down to San Antonio, Texas, and I can remember feeling extremely homesick. My parents tried to ease the transition by taking us to do all these fun things in the city. They were taking us around, and we're getting to see all the different areas, but it wasn't helping. Because I was longing for my home, I wanted to be back in a place that was familiar to me. I can remember telling my mom, I said, Mom, I miss, I miss my school. And she said, Well, you'll have a new school in Texas. And I said, Well, Mom, I miss. I miss my friends. She said, Well, you'll have new friends, you'll make new friends in Texas. I said, Mom, will I miss our house? And she said, Well, you'll have we'll have a new house in Texas. And finally I said, Mom, I missed the mountains. She said, Well, we'll have to get you a poster for that one. But having that feeling of wanting to go back to a place that is familiar to us, and have you ever had that feeling before? Maybe it was when you started college, you were in that unfamiliar place, you're unpacking your stuff, and you're wondering why or how am I going to make it here, soldiers are often deployed to foreign lands, and they're far away from their families and their loved ones. And they may have everything that they need all of their necessities provided for but their heart and their mind is in another place. They're longing to go back home. The Bible says that really that's how all Christians should feel about living in this world. As the Bible talks about us as being strangers, we are aliens, we are just temporary residents, and that this is not really our permanent home, but we are instead longing and desiring to be somewhere else. Our theme for 2019 has been raised with Christ. And this morning, I want to look at a passionate the passage from Colossians three, as we think about being raised with Christ, and how when that happens, it produces within us this longing, this desire to be with Christ raised me in Colossians chapter three, beginning in verse one. It says, if then you were raised with Christ, seek those things which are above where Christ is sitting at the right hand of God sets your mind on things above, not on things on the earth, For you died and your life is hidden with Christ in God. When Christ who is our life appears, then you also will appear with Him in glory. The book of Colossians is similar to many of Paul's other letters, it follows a similar format, and that is in the first part of the letter, Paul lays out a number of foundational Christian doctrines he he identifies these truths. And he goes through in detail he talks about things like Christ being the head over all things and how he delivered us from the power of darkness. But then, in the second half of the letter, chapters three and four, he goes into the sowhat.

Conrad Harkrider  04:36
All of these things are true, but what do they mean to us? What are they? What implication does it have for my life, and how we live today? And the first thing to notice in this section in chapter three is the references to the past, the present and the future. And you can see by the different tenses that Paul used uses that he refers to things that have occurred in the past, things that are now occurring in the present. And then he also speaks of things that are going to soon happen things in the future. Notice a few of these, in verse one, he says that we were raised with Christ. In verse three, he says, For you died, these are things that have already taken place in the life of the Christian. In the present. He says in verse one, that we are to seek those things which are above, in verse two, he says, to set your mind on things above. This defines us in the present, it talks about what what we are doing right now in our everyday lives. And then notice verse four, he refers to the future. He says, When Christ who is our life appears, then you also will appear with Him in glory, we're going to appear with Christ. That is the the hope, that's the expectation that every believer has to hold on to Christ brings significance to every aspect of our lives, and also to every phase, or every life, stage or chapter where we've been, where we are today, and then ultimately where we're headed. Also notice from these verses, that there is an emphasis on Christ, Christ, as mentioned four times in the first four verses of chapter three, in verse one, we are raised with Christ, he talks about where Christ is, and that we should be seeking Him or we should be longing to be with him. In verse three, he says, our life is hidden with Christ. And then in verse four, he makes this remarkable statement. He says that Christ is our life. I believe what Paul is trying to emphasize to the Colossians, and to us as well, is that it is all about Christ, that He is the center of our, our worship, he is the center or focus of our life, he deserves all of our admiration and praise. When I was in middle school, there was the shirts that had come out that were really popular, everybody was wearing them, it was on my list of things that I wanted for my birthday or other other presidents or whatever. And the shirt had these letters on the front, in big bold letters, it would say something like football is life. And on the pitch on, there'll be a picture of a giant football on the shirt. And underneath those big bold letters, there will be some tiny letters. That would say, the rest is just details. And of course, the rest. The the details was referring to other inferior sports, things like basketball and soccer, but also the other stuff that was not as important as football, things like going to school and studying for tests and homework. Those were the details, but football. That was important. That was the real deal. Football was life. In the book of Colossians, Paul says, Jesus Christ is life. He is the source of life, the author, the giver of life. In chapter one and verse 17. He says that He is before all things, and that in him all things consist. Without Christ, we wouldn't be here, but it's not that it's not just that everything was made through him. But Christ is our life and that he gives it meaning and significance and purpose. We live in him chapter two and verse six, and the life that we live is all about Him. Jesus Christ, his life. And we can also say that the rest is just details. And that is to say, where you went to school, and where you live, and what type of house you have, and where you work and how much money you have. And whatever else we may concern ourselves with in this life. Those are they're just details in comparison with Christ.

Conrad Harkrider  09:33
Well, let's look at a few other applications here from this text and verse one, he starts by saying if if you have been raised with Christ, this is what that means. This is what that looks like. Here are the implications he makes reference to this being raised in chapter two and verse 11. And he says in him Also you are circumcised with a circumcision made without hands by putting off the body of flesh, by the circumcision of Christ, having been buried with him in baptism, in which you also, in which you were also raised with Him through faith in the powerful working of God, who raised him from the dead. He says that we were buried with Christ, in baptism, when we go down into that water, what is happening, what process is occurring, it's not just getting wet. It's not just washing off dirt from our physical bodies. Baptism is not so that we can become part of a particular church. Baptism is not just a religious ritual that we go through when we get to a certain age. But rather, we are taking our sins, and that old way of living with all of its selfishness, and fleshly desires. And we are putting those things to death we are burying them in to the water is a statement of resolve. It signifies this turning point in our lives where we are putting our faith and our trust in God where we are depending and relying on him. And what the Lord does. In Colossians, chapter one and verse 14, he talks about how by the blood of Jesus, He washes away our sins, He raises us up to live in a new way. There is this total transformation, we are united together with Christ. That's what happens when we're buried. And in chapter three, he says, if that has occurred, if that dying to your old self and being raised up with Christ in this new life, if that has taken place, then now this is what your present state, this is what your life now looks like. Notice, first of all, in verse one, he says, if you're raised with Christ, seek those things which are above where Christ is sitting at the right hand of God, this longing to be with Christ produces within us a change in direction. He says, we are to seek those things that are above this speaks to our heart, our desire, our ambitions, our goals. What is it that we are striving and working towards? If you were to come up a list, with your top priorities, everything that you're trying to accomplish, or that you're working towards? What would be on that list? What are you trying to achieve in your life? What direction are you headed? In Genesis, chapter 11, the Bible tells us about a large building project that was underway. And all the people had come together and they were they had decided to build a city, a great city. And in that city, they wanted to build a tower, a marvelous and magnificent tower. And in Genesis, chapter 11, and verse four, it says, Come let us build ourselves a city and a tower with its top in the heavens. And let us make a name for ourselves, lest we be dispersed over the face of the whole earth. Building a tower is not wrong. Building a city is not wrong. But notice what their attitude was. Do you see their motivation, they wanted to make a name for themselves. They wanted to do something great. Here on this earth, they're trying to promote their own personal glory. And when God sees their pride and their arrogance, he comes down and he puts a permanent stop on their, on their building project. He confuses the languages and scatters them throughout the whole earth.

Conrad Harkrider  14:01
When we look at the list of what we're trying to accomplish in this life, is it solely focused on benefiting ourselves? We think about our path in life. We want to make good grades. So we can get into this school. We want to get into this school so we can get a degree. We want to get a degree so we can get this job. We want this job so we can make money and buy a house. We want a house so we can get other things and put in it. And it goes on and on and on. But where does the Lord fit in all of those plans? What direction are we pointed towards? Where have we oriented our life? Are we seeking the things above? And how can we seek the things above in the midst of all of the things that we have to do to live in this world? When we're raised with Christ, our ambition and desires should be pointed out towards heaven. We see this in the life of Priscilla, and Aquilla were introduced to them in Acts chapter 18. And Luke tells us that Priscilla and Aquilla were in Ephesus. And there was a man named Paulus who was speaking God's word, but he didn't have a full understanding. And so this couple takes him aside. And they explained to him the way of God more accurately. And they did that because they cared about other people. They cared about the Word of God, they cared about the kingdom and they wanted to help others. In Romans chapter 16, Paul tells us that they were his fellow workers, and that they risked their necks for his life. They put their lives on the line, they were invested in the work. They put themselves out there, they were willing to volunteer and help out when there was a need, even if it meant that there was some type of danger or risk to themselves. And then in First Corinthians chapter 16, Paul mentions that they are hosting the church in their house. They were gracious and hospitable. They open themselves up, because they knew that the work of God was important. And so they did what they could to help out. Were a quinoa and Priscilla. One thing I like about them is that they were ordinary Christians. We don't read about any sermons that they preached. We don't know of any special miraculous gifts. But yet they were working and serving the Lord, did they have a house? Apparently, so? Did they have a profession? Luke tells us that they were tentmakers. But that is not what their life consisted of. They were seeking the things above those things were just tools, and a greater purpose of serving the Lord. In Colossians, chapter three and verse 17, it says, And whatever you do, in word or deed, do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God, the Father through Him. Our actions, our words, everything that we do should be done in the name of the Lord, to the glory of the Lord. And so we need to ask ourselves when we're making a choice, and when we're investing our time, or money, or our interests or pursuits, is this in the direction of things above? Or am I focusing on here on the earth? Also, notice verse two. He says, Set your mind on things above, not on things of the earth. longing to be with Christ means verse two, that there is this change in mindsets. He says, we are to set our mind on things above, not only should our goals and our direction be pointed towards heaven, but our thoughts and our attitudes. And our daily mind should be centered there as well. In Colossians, chapter one and verse 21, he says, and you speaking about before coming to Christ, He says, You were once alienated, and enemies in your mind by wicked works. Yet now he has reconciled, we were once estranged from God, our minds were filled with evil thoughts.

Conrad Harkrider  18:33
I was reading a story about a NFL player named Demario. Davis. He's a linebacker for the New Orleans Saints. And in the story, he was talking about how he grew up in a really rough neighborhood. And there were a lot of bad influences around him. And the story, he said that the person that he looked up to the most was, quote, a guy who was selling drugs, chasing girls, and always trying to prove that he was the toughest guy around. And that's who he wanted to be like, that's who he wanted to follow and model himself after. And, of course, he did for a while, follow that path and ended up spending some time in jail. And it was at that time that a mentor came and started working with him. And helped him to see that this wasn't the path. This wasn't the life that he wanted for himself. And he started telling him about God, and how he needed to change his direction. He needed a new heart and the only person who could give that to him was the Lord. There was a viral story about Demario Davis recently in the news, because he was wearing this headband at some of the games. I don't know if you can see that. But it says, Man of God. I thought about wearing that to my workplace and see what would happen. He was actually fined by the NFL and you can read about what ended up happening. It's kind of a cool story. But what I'm interested in is how can a person go from wanting to follow a drug dealer as their model to openly professing faith in God, the only way that can happen is there's a change in mindset. It means that we no longer value and desire things that are fleshly and evil. The things that once enticed us the things that were once appealing to us that Oh, Lord, us now those things are repulsive. And we see them for for what they really are. And we peel back all of the glamour and, and the lust, and we see it for something that harms our bodies and our minds, and can ultimately damage our soul. Instead of being captivated by sin, when we're raised with Christ, we need to fill our minds with things that are pure, and godly, and righteous and good. Setting our minds fixing our minds on things above. This is not just doesn't just have to do with evil and impure thoughts. Of course, if we have those things, we need to put them to death. But sometimes this is just about being too busy, too occupied with the things in this world. You know, as well as I do that this is a busy time of the year, we have deadlines that are going on at work, school finals are starting to pick up, we got to take care of the house, we're setting up decorations, we're buying gifts for everyone, and they're in their dog. And then we've got all these kids activities, and we throw on several hours of watching football, and then we fit in our Netflix series, and some social media and all of a sudden, we say to ourselves, I have no time, I have no time left over for doing things that are important. There are 24 hours in the day, all of us are given the same number of minutes, we may not have the same amount of energy. I feel like my kids have about five times the storehouse of energy that I do. But we the point is we all have the same amount of time. And the question is, how are we using that time? How are we using it? In Colossians chapter four and verse five, Paul says walk in wisdom toward those who are outside, Redeeming the time making the most or the best use of our time. And so longing to be with Christ means we we set aside time to think about to fill our minds with things that are above and really it comes down to choices. We have choices, do I spend this time on my phone? Or do I spend it with my family? Do I spend this time watching another episode? Or do I spend it reading God's word? Do I spend this time listening to music or to a book or something that's gonna fill my heart in my mind up with worldly thoughts? Or do I take that time to pray and reflect and meditate on God's word? Martha was upset with her sister.

Conrad Harkrider  23:31
She looked at the situation and she said she's not helping I have all this work to do and she's, she's not contributing. But Jesus said to her and Luke chapter 10 And verse 41. But the Lord answered her Martha, Martha, you are anxious and troubled about many things. But one thing is necessary. Mary has chosen the good portion which will not be taken away from her. Life can be extremely busy and chaotic at times, but we can't allow those things are scheduled to distract us to take away from that one thing that is necessary. longing to be with Christ. Also, notice verse three. He says, For you died and your life is hidden with Christ in God. In longing to be with Christ. There is a confidence and security because we have this life in Christ. That gives us a sense of assurance that gives us peace. It gives us hope. Notice the contrast here he says that you have died. But the next few words he talks about your life. Christ in Christ, we now have life and that life is protected. It's hidden in Christ in Galatians chapter two and verse 20. Paul talks about how Christ lives in me. But this is kind of the inverse So instead of Christ living in us, this is say our life is hidden in Christ. It's with Christ. And what I think this is saying is that it's talking about this intimate, special relationship that we have, with Christ with God through Jesus Christ. And knowing that, that knowledge of this relationship produces a sense of comfort, a sense of hope, and peace. You know, in this life, there are all kinds of rejection that we can face. We may feel to rejection from a group of people, we might be rejected at work, we don't, we're not capable or able to get a certain job, we feel rejection from maybe our neighborhood, or people in our community. And that hurts those things they hurt. But in Christ, what we see is there is this acceptance, regardless of what we've done in our past life, regardless of the talents or abilities we believe we have, in Christ, we are welcomed into the family of God, and that produces a sense of confidence, and security. And finally, notice in verse four, he says, When Christ who is our life appears, then you also will appear with Him, in glory, in longing to be with Christ, there is a hope for the future, there is this hope for what is coming up ahead. Because of what Jesus did at the cross, we have forgiveness from our sins, but it doesn't just stop there. It doesn't just give us peace, in this life, by the power of God, he was raised from the dead. And that gives us assurance that one day we too, will be raised, Christ is going to return to the earth, and we will be raised up in glory with him. I appreciate the songs that Jesse led for us. But how often do we think about heaven? Maybe when we are in a worship assembly like this, and we're singing about it and, and praying about it. But outside of these walls? How often do we think about heaven? Sometimes I think about heaven when I'm on an airplane, if you get one of the window seats, and you can look out and you see those spectacular views, all of the clouds, and everything this you can see as far as the horizon, and then the turbulence hits and I started thinking about heaven for other reasons. But heaven, can you imagine what the throne room of God is going to look like? More beautiful than any sunrise or sunset that we've ever seen with our eyes. Heaven will be a place where there is no more sin is void of suffering, and hurt and sadness and sickness. It is a place where all of the faithful throughout time will be. You ever wonder what it would be like to sit with Joseph and David, and to talk with Ruth and Mary, and all those who have faithfully served God throughout time, being with them and praising God together as one.

Conrad Harkrider  28:33
All of God's people joining together. But what makes heaven so special, and so desired more than anything else is our desire and our longing to be with Christ to be with the Lord. Someone once said that a person who thinks about heaven and the streets of gold and the pearly gates, and doesn't talk about Christ is like the bride who tells about the crystal and the fine china and the tablecloths. But says nothing about the groom, about the one that she is about to spend the rest of her life with. Heaven is going to be wonderful because that's where the Lord is. And our desire should be to be with Christ. And when we spend our entire lives thinking about setting our minds on, and pursuing the things above departure from this earth, will just mean the fulfillment of our lifelong desires and dreams. It's why Paul could say in Philippians, chapter one and verse 21, For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain. Do you feel that longing for heaven and to be with the Lord? If not, maybe it's because we've allowed the world to have too much of our hearts. We're going to close with a song Time to encourage all of us to rededicate ourselves to the Lord, to think about the greatest treasures that we have in this life. And if you're not a child of God, we want to, we want to encourage you to think about your relationship with Christ. If there's something that we can do to encourage you in your walk with the Lord, please come down to the front as we stand in seeing
