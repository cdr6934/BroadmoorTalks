First Kings 18.

Conrad Harkrider  00:30
I recently learned about a group of researchers and archaeologists who have conducted several explorations over in Turkey on Mount Arafat. Mount Arafat is a towering snow capped mountain that sits at about 17,000 feet in elevation that's taller than any of the mountains in the Rocky Mountains. And they've gone over there as looking as a place to try and find some biblical artifacts. In Genesis, the Bible tells us that Noah and his family at the end of the flood that the ark came to rest in the mountains, of erat and so they have gone over there, and have conducted several digs on the top and sides of the mountain looking for remains of the ark. Now, they're not the first ones to do that people have been searching for the Ark for 1000s of years. But I want you just to think about the possibility. If you woke up tomorrow, and the headlines were a large wooden structure found a top mount erat. And after doing further analysis, and testing and dating and whatnot, on the the artifacts that they found, they determined that the age of that wood dated approximately around the time that that Noah and his family would have been on the ark. How would that impact you? Would that be a game changer for the world? I think it's normal for us to desire to have some type of physical proof that what we believe in is real, that it's validated. And sometimes we may wonder, Why does God have to be invisible? Why is it God, something that we can see, it's feasible to think that he would just be up in the sky. And when we go out in the morning, we look up and we Wave at him, and he waves back and then we go on about the rest of our day. Or what about if he could just communicate with us like he did with Samuel, when he called out to him in the middle of the night, and maybe God could give us personalized messages where he spoke directly to each one of us. But the fact is that, throughout human history, God has revealed himself to people, he has shown himself to mankind. And many of those accounts are recorded for us. In this book, we can read about what has happened in times past. So this morning, I want to look at an account from First Kings chapter 18, as we think about God revealing himself to man when God reveals Himself, and look at the type of response or the reaction or the outcome, that that should produce in us and in people when God reveals Himself. So read with me first Kings chapter 18. As Elijah meets the prophets of bale on Mount Carmel, First Kings 18, beginning in verse 20. It says, So Ahab sent for all the children of Israel and gathered the prophets together on Mount Carmel. And Elijah came to all the people and said, How long will you falter between two opinions? If the Lord is God, follow him. But if Baal, follow him, but the people answered him not a word that Elijah said to the people I alone am left a prophet of the Lord but bales prophets are 450 men. Therefore let them give us two bowls and let them choose one bowl for themselves. Cut it in pieces and lay it on the wood and put no fire under it. And I will prepare the other bowl and lay it on the wood but put no fire under it. Then you call on the name of your gods and I will call him The name of the Lord and the God who answers by fire. He is God. So all the people answered and said It is well spoken. Let's set the stage here in First Kings chapter 18, there has been a severe drought that has overtaken the land.

Conrad Harkrider  05:20
For over three years it has not rained. But it's not just the land that is parched, the spiritual condition of the people has dried up, Ahab The King is not a good person, he has led the children of Israel into idolatry, serving the bales and estrus that's now the national religion of for God's people. Ahab goes out to try and find some water, but instead of coming upon some springs, he finds the prophet Elijah. And Elijah says that he wants all of the people, the prophets of Baal Ahab, all the people to meet him at Mount Carmel, they come to the mountain and there is this challenge that is set before the people. Bail is considered the God of life, the god of fertility, the God of Rain, which is a ironic because there is this severe drought, apparently, the God of Rain is not doing his job. He's not. He's not holding up to his end of the bargain here. And so Elijah says that there should be a test is based on the real God or is the Lord the true God. And so he puts out this challenge before them that they would take two bowls. Elijah would take one the prophets of bale with the other they would prepare the the animal, put it onto the wood. And then they would call upon their God, and the God who answers by fire. He is the true God. Now, if you think about this, from the prophets of bales perspective, they are serving the God of Rain. And so thunder bolt of lightning seems like a pretty rational or a pretty realistic thing to ask for certainly bail sins, Thunderbolts all the time when the storms come. And so surely he can burn up this little pile of wood if they call and ask him to. And so they said this before the people verse 24, say they say that this is a good idea. This is well spoken, so that we can determine who the true and living God is. Notice the challenge that Elijah gives to the people in verse 21. It says, And Elijah came to all the people and said, How long will you falter between two opinions? If the Lord is God, then follow him. But if Baal, follow him. But the people answered him, not a word. You see, they have nothing to say at this, they have no response. And the first application that we can see from this account here is that when God reveals Himself to man, it should cause us to give or offer our full heart. These people are sitting on the fence, they are totally indecisive about which direction they should go. They are unwilling to make a decision, the ESV says that they are limping from one place to the next. They would come over to this side and serve bail for a time and then they would be back over here and serving the Lord. But there is no commitment. There is no decision that is made up in their minds. And Elijah tells them that they should choose, they should make a choice for themselves and either serve the Lord or serve the bills. What's sad about this is that God is trying to convince his own people that they should be serving Him. We think about God revealing himself to the children of Israel, time and time again. He brought them out of the land of Egypt. He appeared on the mountain in in smoke and fire when he came and brought the 10 commandments. He brought them into the land and gave them a place to live. And then again and again he delivers them out of the hands of their enemies. And yet they are still trying to figure out if they are going to serve the God of heaven or serve the bales. The problem with that is that God is not going to share our hearts with anything else. If we say that we believe that there is a God that He is the Lord, then that demands that we offer up our complete devotion and commitment to him.

Conrad Harkrider  10:16
Have you ever known a guy who has tried to date two different girls at the same time, and that worked out for him. I had a friend in college and one year for Valentine's Day, he sent the same text message to four different girls. Will you be my Valentine. And they were excited. They they were getting attention from this guy, they finally had a Valentine, they were hoping that this would maybe turn into some type of further relationship, they were gushing. Until they heard they were not the only ones, they got that message. And it was like this shock and surprise, you mean, you got the same thing. And so my friend went from having several options to zero options, as that usually is how that works out. But the Lord is not willing to share our affection with anything else. He wants it all he wants all of our hearts, all of our soul, our mind and our strength. There are so many things in this world that can be pulling out our hearts. And we can be like the people and Elijah's today where we are faltering. We're wavering between serving God and serving things of this world. It doesn't have to be another deity, maybe it's something like as simple as physical possessions. This time of year is really challenging. We think about finding things on sale and buying things that we want, and that we need. And we can kind of get into the trap where we're just thinking so much about stuff about worldly possessions, things that I want, and I make the list and I start, you know, thinking about when I'm going to get it and how much I'm going to pay and all this kind of stuff we can get wrapped up in the things of this world. The entire family comes into town, all of the people that are closest to us. And yet I'm over in the corner messing with my new gadget. I realized these things are not inherently wrong, that they can be used as tools for good but at what point do we spend so much of our attention and energy and focus on things that it would it could be said that that is my idol that has become my God. The Lord wants to be in that top position. He wants to be number one. He wants to be what I think about day in and day out what I dream about what I am anticipating what I'm looking forward to most in my life, not the new job, not the new house, not getting the new phone or tablet or whatever it may be. Because these things pale in comparison to the true God of Heaven, to think about seeing him spending eternity in Heaven with the Lord. So the challenge is for us to redirect our attention and our commitment and our focus back to God to center it on His ways, His purposes on his people being about his business, as opposed to making our priorities, all these other things that are around us. Are we limping between our service to Him and something else. When we fully see his presence in our lives when he reveals himself, that should motivate us to offer up our whole lives to give our whole heart to him. Well, let's continue with the reading. In verse 25. It says, Now Elijah said to the prophets of Bale, choose one of the bulls for yourselves and prepare it first for you are many and call on the name of your God but put no fire under it. So they took the ball which was given them and they prepared it and called on the name of bale from morning till evening from morning till noon, saying O Baal hear us, but there was no voice, no one answered. Then they leaked about the altar which they had made.

Conrad Harkrider  14:51
So it wasn't noon that Elijah mocked him saying cry aloud for he is a god. Either he is meditating or he is busy or he's on a journey or for him She is sleeping and must be awakened. So they cried aloud and cut themselves as was their custom with knives and Lance's until the blood gushed out on them. And when midday was passed, they prophesied until the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice. But there was no voice. No one answered, no one paid attention. Elijah tells the prophets of bale that they can go first they can have the first crack at at this challenge here, they have so many prophets 450, they have a whole cohort of men who have been designated ordained in the service and worship of Baal. So surely they can provoke a response from their God. They start early in the morning, they cry out bail, hear us trying to get his attention. And you see that they start to escalate their efforts. First, they start with a cry, and then they begin to make all kinds of commotion. They're leaping and dancing and jumping around the altar trying to get bail, to hear their petition. In about noon, after watching this for a couple of hours, Elijah, he starts to kind of poke fun at them, you have to appreciate the humor here. He says, you know, maybe this is not working because bail is just he's asleep. Or maybe he's gone on a journey or he's meditating or he's traveling somewhere, maybe you just need to say it a little bit louder, in order to get his attention. And so being provoked by Elijah, they start to bring it up to the next level. And the text says that they begin to cut themselves verse 28, not just a little paper cut. But they use swords and lances, and they are gushing with blood. This is horrific, this scene of these men who are trying to somehow get their God to take notice of them. But the text is very clear, it says but there was no fire, no voice, no answer. When you look at verse, Look back at verse 22, what it says that Elijah said to the people, I alone am left a prophet of the Lord. But bales prophets are 450 men. It's a simple point, but realize that when God reveals himself as he had done with Elijah, it should move us to stand for his cause. Elijah is heavily outnumbered. 450 prophets of bail versus the lone prophets of the Lord, the King and the Queen are serving bail. The whole nation has gone after bale. There are droves of prophets that are serving this God. And then there's Elijah. Do you ever feel like that? You ever feel like you're the only person who is trying to make the right decision? You go to the holiday party, and you're the only one that's not drinking alcohol. At school, you're the only person who hasn't seen that movie. You only you're the only one in that group who doesn't dress that way. It doesn't talk like that or doesn't partake in those activities. And we can start to feel pretty isolated as Elijah does here. Was he really the only one that was trying to serve God? In chapter 19 And verse 18, as God reveals himself in the mighty wind, and he comes and presents himself on the mountain to Elijah. He tells him in chapter 19, in verse 18, yet I will leave 7000 in Israel, all the knees that have not bowed to Baal and every mouth that has not kissed him. You see, there were others in Israel, that were still serving God, just as it is for us today, when we feel isolated and alone, like we're the only ones that are trying to keep up and do it this way. There are still others that are seeking after God. But sometimes it can feel like I'm by myself. You know what it takes

Conrad Harkrider  19:32
to serve God when everyone else is doing something different. That's called courage. It takes courage to go against the crowd, to stand up for what's right to be different in those moments. When everyone is saying, Yes, this is great. This is the way it should be done. This is so cool. This is what's in and we stand against it. That takes courage. And the question is, do we have the courage to be able to stand against the things that our culture is pushing that's promoting that saying this is okay. homosexuality has become something that is widely accepted. Abortion is now a right, sleeping with whoever, whenever you want that has become a standard, something that is not even questioned. And you look at the use of drugs and the rampant lust and the greed that exists in our society today. Everyone is pushing, just do what makes you feel good. When when God has revealed Himself to us, that should give us the courage to stand up for what's right. In Matthew chapter seven, in verse 13. It says, Enter through the narrow gate for the gate is wide, and the way is broad that leads to destruction. And there are many who enter through it, for the gate is small in the way is narrow that leads to life. And there are few who find it. Which path are we following? Which path are we walking on? Are we going on the path that everyone else is trudging down the path that is wide and easy. Jesus says that the way that leads to him is narrow and difficult, and there are few who find it. But we must be willing to be different than to be different from the rest of the world and stand for his purposes. And that's what we see in Elijah all by himself, standing for God on the mountain. Well, let's look back at verse 31st kings 18 And verse 30. After the prophets of bale have concluded their efforts, so they've kind of raved on into the late evening. Finally, Elijah brings the people to Himself, it says in verse 30, then Elijah said to all the people, come near to me, so all the people came near to him and he repaired the altar of the Lord that was broken down. And Elijah took 12 stones according to the number of the tribes of the sons of Jacob, to whom the word of the Lord had come saying, Israel shall be your name. Then with the stones, he built an altar in the name of the Lord. And he made a trench around the altar large enough to hold to see as of seed, and he put the wood in order and cut the bowl and pieces and laid it on the wood and said, fill for waterpots with water and pour it on the burnt sacrifice and on the wood. Then he said, do it a second time, and they did it a second time. Then he said, do it a third time, and they did it a third time. So the water ran all around the altar, and he also filled the trench with water. And it came to pass at the time of the offering of the evening sacrifice that Elijah the prophet came near and said, Lord God of Abraham, Isaac and Israel, let it be known this day that you are God and Israel and that I am your servant, and that I have done all these things at your word. Hear me, oh, Lord, hear me that this people may know that You are the Lord God and that you have turned their hearts back to you. Again.

Conrad Harkrider  23:25
When the evening sacrifice comes, Elijah brings all of the people to him. And he begins to repair the altar of the Lord. He takes 12 stones, one for each of the tribes of Israel. I wonder if he said the names as he picked the stones up Reuben, Simeon, Levi Judah to remind them of their heritage, where they had come from, he digs a trench around the altar. And he has them fill fill up for waterpots fool. And they pour it over the sacrifice and the wood and the stones. He has them do this three times. So that the 12 stones have now been doused 12 times with water. Elijah is certainly building the anticipation for what's about to happen here but he also wants them to know that this is no trick. This is no sleight of hand here. This is completely covered and saturated in water. Also notice how calm Elijah is. The prophets of Bale has spent all day jumping around cutting themselves making this huge commotion and Elijah very calmly and with with great discretion in verse 36. Look at what he says. He says Lord God of Abraham, Isaac and Israel, let it be known this day, that you are the God of Israel and that I am your servant, and that I have done all these things at your word. When we realize who God is, it should prompt us to follow His Word. Elijah is not acting based upon his own thoughts and opinions. He's not following what he thinks is best or what seems like a good thing to him. But instead, he has stayed faithful to the Word of the Lord. And this is a important point, that when we are worshiping and serving God, it's not enough just to be sincere. When the prophets of Baal were trying to get him to answer, no one could question their sincerity. They believed that bail would answer. And not only that, but they were willing to suffer physical harm, to go to great lengths to be under this great bodily injury to show their commitment. They were dedicated to the cause. There are many today who are dedicated to what they believe in. They will even give up their lives taking often taking the lives of others, but they believe in what they're following. But the problem is that it's not true. They are serving something that is false. And the lesson for us today is we can spend endless amounts of time and energy and money. We can cross land and see pursuing different activities. We can give our very lives for the cause. But if it's not done according to truth, then we're misguided. Without His Word, we are like blind people crawling around in the darkness. We're just left up to our own thoughts and ideas about how God should be worshipped where, how He wants us to live our lives, how this world is supposed to operate. And praise be to God that He has spoken to us that He has given us instruction and His Word and His will for us that he's revealed that to us. And the question is, are we going to follow it? Are we going to do what he's asked us to do? Or rely on our own feelings and judgment judgments? The man named Saul, who later became the Apostle Paul was zealously doing what he thought was right, persecuting Christians. And it wasn't until the Lord appeared to him on the road and, and he realized that he was actually fighting against God.

Conrad Harkrider  28:12
serving the Lord is more than just passion, or commitment or enthusiasm, enthusiasm, it has to be done according to his Word. And that's what we see in Elijah. He says, I have done all of this at your command. Well, let's look at the conclusion here. In verse 38, it says, the fire of the Lord fell and consumed the burnt sacrifice and the wood and the stones and the dust and it licked up the water that was in the trench. Now when all the people saw it, they fell on their faces, and they said, The Lord, He is God the Lord. He is God. And Elijah said, seize the prophets of bale. Do not let one of them escaped. So they seize them and Elijah brought them down to the brook Keshawn. And he executed them there. Elijah, as he finishes his prayer, fire from heaven comes down and consumes the sacrifice. But it's not just burning up on top of the pile there. It burns up the meat from the animal and burns up the wood and burns up the stones. It even licks up the water that's in the trench and burns the very dust on the ground. The answer from Heaven is total and complete. There was no doubt that God had sent this fire. Elijah then takes the prophets of bale and he executes them. They probably didn't do very good running away or they were bleeding and all cut up and had been mangled from the day but they're in ultimately is execution. For following this false God, and the final verdict from the people, they fall on their faces, and they say the Lord, He is God, the Lord, He is God. When God reveals Himself, it should cause us to trust that He hears and answers. Since God had revealed himself to Elijah, Elijah knew that he was there, that he would hear his prayer, and that ultimately he could answer with fire from heaven. If you contrast that with the response from bail in verse 29, it says, After calling on bail, there was no voice. No one answered, no one paid attention. Baal didn't show any regard. He didn't care that they were crying out, he didn't acknowledge them because he wasn't a real God. There was no answer. Is that how we feel about the Lord? Sometimes? We ask God for something, we plead with him to remove something from our lives. We say I'm really struggling with this. Or this is weighing me down. And we wait a couple of days, and then we wait a few weeks, and then we wait months, and it's still there. And we think to ourselves, why hasn't God heard me? We start to get frustrated or maybe even angry, and we think, does God not care? Doesn't he realize how difficult this is? In First John, chapter five and verse 14. It says, and this is the confidence that we have toward him that if we ask anything according to His will, He hears us. Do we have that confidence as children of God to know that he hears our prayers, when we pray to Him, that He knows our struggle, and our pain? When Abel was killed by his brother, Esau, the Bible tells us that His blood cried out from the ground. When the children of Israel were in Egypt under bondage and oppression, it says that their cries came up to the Lord. And in Revelation, chapter six, those who were killed for the Word of God and their testimony, they cried out how long Oh, Lord, before you will avenge, Yes, God is listening. He's there, he hears us. And that doesn't mean that he removes all suffering, that he doesn't allow bad things to happen or for us to go through some type of trial. But we can take comfort in knowing that we serve a God who is compassionate, and understanding, and who listens, when we pray.

Conrad Harkrider  33:13
Our view is limited. We see things from our perspective, we see things from the here and now this moment right here. God's view is looking over all of eternity. We see how this is impacting my life, God is looking at across all of humanity. Maybe there is some greater purpose as to why this happened. Maybe God can mold this and use it for some greater means. Or maybe this is just the result of living in a broken world. And its purpose is just to produce within me a greater sense of dependence on God and trust in His grace. The Lord is a God who not only hears but he answers our prayer. And we have to believe that he gives strength to those who are weary. He provides comfort when we're broken. He gives shelter and refuge from the storms of life. In Psalm 145, in verse 18, it says, The Lord is near to all who call on him, to all who call on Him in truth. He fulfills the desire of those who fear him. He also hears their cry and saves them

Conrad Harkrider  34:47
God has revealed himself to man it doesn't. Would the world change if they found Noah's Ark up on the mountain? Maybe for a few weeks, months? But people would ultimately question that, challenge it. Again and again, throughout human history God has made himself known. And the question is how do we respond? What is our response? When we realize that there is a God, and that he is the one who answers from heaven. We're going to close this morning with a song and we use it as an opportunity to encourage those who are here if there's something that we can do to help you grow in your faith, if you need to make some type of public statement, or confession or if there's, this is an opportunity to commit your life to the Lord to begin that brought that process in that journey. There's something we can do to help you in any way please come down to the front as we stand and seeing
