Good evening. It's good to see everyone here tonight, it's certainly good. We can gather together and worship our God, we've been concentrating on the theme this year of being raised with Christ. And being raised with Christ has many implications. That's really one facet of a relationship that we have with Christ. Appreciate very much the songs that were led. Tonight, it helped focus our attention on that relationship with Christ. In fact, that's what I'd like to talk with you for a few minutes about tonight. In the beginning, God created us in order to have a relationship with Him. If you look at the entire Bible, it's made of 66 books, but it tells a single story. And if you break that story down, it's a God wanting to have a relationship with us. Sin has broken that relationship and created a great strain and that relationship, but God has pursued us, he pursued Israel in the Old Testament pursued his people, and he sent his son Jesus Christ, and to live on this earth and to die on the cross as the ultimate expression of His love for all people. And why did he do that? We did that so that he could have a relationship with us. And so as we think about Jesus, and think about what he has done for us, we can't help but but have full gratitude for all those things. Jesus is our Savior, and he provides us that access to the Father. So if we're to know God, as God wants us to, then we will come to know Jesus Christ. So I'd like to talk tonight for a few moments about our relationship to Christ. So what does that relationship look like? Well, first of all, we are under Christ, we are under Christ. And that simply means that we are in submission to Christ, we all exist underneath his authority and power underneath his lordship. We know that God is King of the universe, and that Jesus Christ has been given all authority. But there is a question that exists today. And that is will you recognize as authority, or will you deny it? The Bible says in Ephesians, one verses 22, and 23. And he put all things under his feet and gave him his head over all things, the Church, which is His body, the fullness of Him who feels all in all, Christ is the head of the church, he is over all things, he is over the church and the church exists under him underneath his authority, underneath his power, and his mind, God has given him all authority. So we ask the question, what what is left out of that? Is there anything that is excluded from his power in his mind? And the answer is, there is nothing? Is there anything that the church must go to apart from Christ? Is there anyone or anything outside of Christ from which we need to derive our authority? The answer is no. We are under Christ underneath his authority. In Matthew 28, and verse 18, or excuse me, verse 20, he says, It is verse 18, All authority in heaven on earth has been given to me. He says, Jesus has been given all authority and is on that basis that he commands His disciples to go and teach all people. But here we see that Jesus has all authority. And so the first relationship that I want to talk about is the fact that we are under Christ. underneath his authority, we must recognize as Christ we must recognize Christ as Lord, and acknowledges thority in our life. In Romans 10, verse nine, it says, because if you confess with your mouth that Jesus is Lord, and believe in your heart, that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saying, notice that's more than a propositional truth. It is a statement of fact, Jesus is Lord, that is his position. But it's more than just saying that he holds that title that relates to our life, doesn't it? To say that Jesus is Lord is to confess that He is Lord of Milea that he is over everything that I do, that I will follow him in all ways and all things. And so we see this need to acknowledge Him as Lord and Romans 10 In verse 13. It goes on to say For everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be say, to call upon Him to depend upon him.

Jeremy Sweets  04:51
First Peter three in verse 15, the New American Standard Version says what sanctify Christ as Lord in your hearts, that means to set him apart, to sanctify him to give him a position of prominence of preeminence, to establish Him as Lord in your heart. Again, that tells us it's not just the propositional truth, although it is that but it's more than that. It dictates every, every piece of our life. In Philippians, two verses nine through 11, we see that one day all people will bow before and acknowledge Jesus is Christ. Therefore, there it says, Therefore, God has highly exalted him and bestowed on him the name that is above every name. So that the name of Jesus every knee should bow, in heaven and on earth, and under the earth, and every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God, the fall. Now, this tells us about a future state, and it tells us that ultimately, every single person in this ever live will bow their knee and confess that Jesus is Lord. Now that's not the reality of the way things are today, is it? Not everyone? Bounce their knee. Not everyone confesses, but right now everyone has that choice to make, you can choose to acknowledge His Lordship, or you can deny it. Now one day, you will, you will have to acknowledge it, you'll have no other choice. But now we have that choice to make. Will we acknowledge His Lordship. So the first relationship to Christ one talk about his being in submission to Him submitting our lie. I'm also talks about the fact that we are with Christ, we are with Christ. And we can see that in terms of loyalty, will we stand with him? Will we be with him? Are we on his side? Or are we against him? As I mentioned, living with Christ is a choice that we have to make, it does not happen automatically. You know, sometimes, things happen for us by default.

Jeremy Sweets  07:12
If you sign up for some service, they may have some, some settings or some things that come along just without doing anything. But that's not that's not the way it is when it comes to serving Christ. We can't serve Him by default, we must make the decision and make the choice. There is no default, that does not happen automatically. And there is no middle ground to you. In Matthew 12, and verse 30, it says, Whoever is not with me is against me. And whoever does not gather with me scatters. Notice what Jesus calls us to hear. He says he wants us to be with him to stand with him. And if we don't make that choice, and we've made the other choice, we're against him. And so we can't say that I'm gonna choose neither. That's not an option. We either stand with him or against him. So what he wants from us is that we would be with him. What he has promised us, His disciples is that he will always be with us. In Matthew 28 and verse 20. It says, Behold, I am with you always. So the end of the age. What are amazing statements that Jesus Christ has made to us and to all the softgels I'll be with you until the end of the age. Now I recognize he was talking to his apostles here, but clearly this extends, doesn't it to all believers, Jesus Christ is with us. There are a lot of people that feel alone and isolated. God has promised to be with them. Jesus Christ says, I am with you. I think back to the Old Testament of Elijah that felt like he was alone as one serving God, there was no one that stands with me. But here, Jesus Christ says, I am with you. So the question is, will we be with Christ while we show him our loyalty? Not only is with Christ and being with Christ, a statement of loyalty but it's also a statement of fellowship or participation, fellowship or participation. We have fellowship with Christ. And this is truly an amazing truth. In Hebrews two verse 11, it states for he who sanctifies and those who are sanctified all have one source. That is why he is not ashamed to call them brothers, saying I will tell of your name to my brothers in the midst of the congregation, I will sing your praise. Jesus Christ relates to us and he came to this earth in order to relate with us. He took on flesh And here the text says that he calls us brothers. He calls us brothers. He's a prince and a king. And we're his brother. We stand with him and have fellowship with the very Son of God. Not only that, but we see that that participation again extends into every facet of our life, and it's used in those terms of life and death. The Bible says that we participate with Christ in his life and death. In Romans chapter six and verse four to the Lord or latter part of that passage. It says, just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, so we too, might walk in newness of life. And notice that there it says that we are raised with Christ. Romans six and verse three, a passage right before says that we have been buried with Christ, we are with him, and where are we with him in his death, and His resurrection. We bear with him all things associated with his death and resurrection. And Galatians chapter two and verse 20, we see that this participation could be described as being crucified with Christ, at least that's how Paul would describe it. He says, I have been crucified with Christ, there's no longer I who live but Christ who lives in me, and the life I now live in the flesh, I live by faith in the Son of God who loved me, and gave himself for me, just as Christ was crucified and put to death on a cross. Paul says that I have been crucified with him, I had been put to death with him. And that means that I no longer live. Jesus died when he was on the cross. As far as his earthly life goes, he no longer lived on the earth in that way. He was put to death. And so it is for us. Paul says, I've been crucified with Christ and it is no longer I who live but Christ who lives in me.

Jeremy Sweets  12:12
I'm no longer calling the shots, directing the action, I'm no longer the one that gets to do what he wants, fulfills my own desires. But rather I serve Jesus Christ, I follow after him. I participate with him so much so that here the text says that it is Christ who lives in me, he lives through me through how I act and how I live, the choices I make, we can display the life of Christ, so that people can see Christ in us. In Colossians three, in verse one, it says there that if then you have been raised with Christ, seek the things that are above where Christ is seated at the right hand of God, to have fellowship with grace with Christ and participate with him, or criers, that we would pursue him and pursue things that are spiritual in nature, we would set our mind or establish our mind on the things of God and what He desires rather than on simply what we want and what we desire. If we'd been raised with Him, if we participate with him, and have that fellowship with Him, that demands something of our life, that we would give up all things and serve Him, that our minds would be focused not on the things of this life, the physical thing, but on spiritual thing. And that doesn't mean we escape the reality of here. But it means that we see our present reality in terms of what God has done for us. And so that doesn't mean we go and hide from the realities that we have to face the life that we live here. But it does mean that when we live our life we understand that God has overall things we understand that God created all things that we are underneath him and our minds are fixed on that which is spiritual. A mind that is fixed on what is physical says that this is all there is. This is all there is. Mize will eat, drink and be merry for tomorrow we die when become the food of worms. A life that is physical says that's all there is. But the spiritually minded person says, No, this life has meaning. And we need to live in service to God because there is something more and there is someone more. So yes, we have fellowship with Christ. I really appreciate the the theme that we've had this years we've thought about being raised with Him. It's not just that God has raised Although certainly he has, but it's a beautiful picture to say that we've been raised with Christ, we are with him in this journey. He is the one that we follow after, and he is the one that we participate with. He is the model that we follow. And as we, as we serve Him, He is with us. He is with us. So we see in our relationship to Christ that we are with him and that demands both our loyalty and and involves our participation as well.

Jeremy Sweets  15:33
We also see that we are in Christ, we have a union with Christ, to be in Christ is to be in union with Him. Notice if you would in Ephesians, chapter one, verses three through 14 Ephesians, one three through 14. So a little bit longer reading, I'm gonna read this whole passage. And you'll notice that 10 times at least 10 times while on my account, it says in him or in Christ, or in the Beloved, some form of that, that we are in Him. And it says that all spiritual blessings are in Christ. So notice this passage with me Ephesians one starting in verse three, blessed to be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us in Christ, with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places, even as they chose us in Him before the foundation of the world, that we should be holy and blameless before him. In love, He predestined us for adoption to himself, his sons through Jesus Christ, according to the purpose of His will, to the praise of His glorious grace with which He has blessed us in the Beloved. In Him, we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of His grace, which He lavished upon us and all wisdom and insights, making known to us the mystery of his will, according to His purpose, which he set forth in Christ as a plan for the fullness of time to unite all things in him things in heaven, and things on the earth. Verse 11, In Him we have obtained and inheritance, having been predestined according to the purpose of him who walks works all things according to the counsel of his will, so that we who were the first to hope in Christ might be to the praise of his glory. In Him, you also when you heard the word of truth, the gospel of your salvation and believed in him, were sealed with the promised Holy Spirit, who is the guarantee of our inheritance until we acquire possession of it to the pray to the praise of his glory. Notice that the first statement there tells us what's involved with this. every spiritual blessing is in Christ. In Christ, when we are in union with Christ, we can think about Christ as a place of safety, a place of blessings. And if we are in Him, we have access to all the things that he offers. If we are outside of Christ, we don't have access to those things. So what does he say that we have access to what is every spiritual blessing when he goes on to say what those blessings are, first of all, we have been chosen in Him before the foundation of the world to be holy and blameless. He chose the type of person that we are to be. It also says that He predestined us for adoption through Jesus Christ, we can be adopted. Jesus Christ calls us his brother, and we can be adopted because of Christ. We have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of our sins, and so we can be saved from our sins because of his blood. We see that God set forth his purpose in Christ to unite all things in him. We are all to come back and be united with Him that is God's purpose, so that we might ultimately have fellowship with Him. In Him, it says, we have an inheritance, we have something to look forward to. We have something that has been left for us, and in him we have been sealed with the Holy Spirit until we attain it. We have been given a promise, a promise. And so we see that all these things are found were in Christ. Is there any advantage to being in Christ? Absolutely. Absolutely. There is safety in Christ. You know when there is a storm coming? There is danger outside we tell everyone wants to get inside. The weather people get on the TV and they say this storm is coming. You need to get inside seek safety seek shelter. That's what we have in Jesus Christ. In Romans eight and verse one, it says, Therefore, there is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.

Jeremy Sweets  20:13
Outside of Christ, it's a dangerous place just like that store. dangerous things can happen outside of Christ, but it is in Christ that we find a place of safety and security. When we are in Him. We have access to the safety that he provides and all the blessings that He provides. What a great blessing that is to be able to be in Christ. Well, we've talked about being in Christ with Christ and under Christ and submission to Him. And I think those are the main relationships that I think of. I know there are other prepositions that are used to talk about that relationship to him. But let me close with talking about how we get into Christ. We've talked about the blessings of being in Christ. But now the question resides, and that is, how do we get into Christ? Well, the Bible says that we are baptized into Christ. In Romans six, in verse three, it says, Do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ, Jesus were baptized into his death, we are baptized into we we come into a relationship with Him through our baptism Galatians, three verses 26. And 27 says, For your all sons of God, through faith in Christ Jesus, for all of you who are baptized into Christ, have closed yourselves with Christ. And the New Testament, we see that the gospel was proclaimed, it was proclaimed to others so that they might accept Jesus Christ as their Savior. And how did they do that? And what did they do? Well, it was a process, they believe the message, they said, I believe this so much, that I'm going to change my life and repent of all the things that I've been doing. I'm going to turn away from sin and turn to you, I'll confess that Jesus is the Christ and be baptized into Christ. After they were baptized, what did they do? They rejoiced. They were glad they felt the weight of sin, as it had been removed, and they rejoice. You see, they understood that they were baptized into that Christ that was proclaimed. And the same opportunity exists today. We also can be baptized into Jesus Christ. You know, the use of this word into Christ is also found in one other place that I found, and that's in Ephesians, four, we can think about the fact that we are baptized into Christ, but I appreciate what Ephesians four adds to this. In verse 15, it says, rather speaking the truth in love, we are to grow up in every way into him, who is the head into Christ, from whom the whole body joined and held together by every joint with which it is equipped, when each part is working properly, makes the body grow so that it builds itself up in love. Yes, we are baptized into Christ as we begin our relationship with Him in earnest at that time. But there's also a sense in which we grow into him. There is a process of becoming more and more like him, becoming more united with Him as we grow. And so I appreciate that added picture of growth into Christ into Christ. That's the lesson tonight as we think about our relationship to Christ. But I want to just close by asking a few questions. The first one is, is your life fully under Jesus lordship? Now this has been a general lesson about about our relationship to him. But I want us to think specifically, I can't answer the questions for you about how that looks in your life. But are you fully under Jesus lordship? Have you fully submitted to him? Or is there something in your life that you're holding back? Is there something in your life who says I'll give him everything but this but my pet sin or I'll give him everything but but my hobby? It takes plot priority, I'll give him everything but that's a dangerous place to be in. Is there something in your life that you have held back from submitting to Jesus? Are you working with Jesus? Is your life completely filled with working alongside Jesus? If Jesus were to come back in the flesh again, I understand that he's not going to do that.

Jeremy Sweets  24:56
But if he were to come back in the flesh again, and go with you throughout your day, would it change what you did? Would it change how you act? Would it change how you talk? Would it change what you thought about? You say we are called to work and walk with Jesus in this line. And it may help you to think about if Jesus is right there, because he might not physically be there. But as we saw in Matthew 28, Jesus is with us. And so we need to have the understanding that what we do now, it should be with Jesus in accord with his will. So, are you working with Jesus living with Jesus? Thirdly, do you find your identity in Jesus? Are you in Jesus Christ? And is that who you are? Does that define who you are? Bible says that we can be in Christ and have access to all these tremendous blessings. In this life, it also means we'll have access to suffering and persecution, doesn't it? Are we in Christ? Do we find our identity in him? So much so that we would be willing even to suffer with him? Do you find your identity in Jesus? And then also at ask, have you been baptized into Christ Jesus? If you're here to not and here tonight, and you're not a Christian, you have an opportunity to obey the gospel message, believing that Jesus is the Christ repenting of your sins, confessing Jesus as the Christ and being baptized in the water for the forgiveness of your sin. Have you done that? I promise you, if you will do that your sins will be washed away, and you can rejoice and will rejoice with you. That's a beautiful thing. If you're here tonight, and you are a Christian, but you're not living as you should, you're not honoring the commitment you made at your baptism. And that is, you promised that you would give God your life and all of your life forever, for as long as you live. So if you're not honoring that commitment, you also need to make changes. There's anyone subject to the invitation at this time. Please come as we stand and sing
