Good morning if you have your Bibles and want to open up to Matthew the first chapter of Matthew chapter one.

Conrad Harkrider  00:27
Couple of weeks ago, we were celebrating my father in law's birthday and we went over to the Opryland area. If you're not familiar with Nashville, that's a really popular tourist area. It's got a lot of shops and it's home to the grand old Opry. They have the Gaylord Opryland hotel, and resort if you've never been there, it's like a little miniature city. It's enormous inside and around Christmas time, they put up this impressive display of lights. And this time of year, I really enjoy looking at lights that other people have set up. And so we made our way over to the hotel, it was cold outside, we were bundled up, and we got out to the front of the hotel. And we just stood there and were amazed to see all of the trees draped and covered in these lights. They have some of the trees that were literally every branch has a light fixed to it. And there's a towering Christmas tree, that standing there out front. And we must have stood there for 30 to 45 seconds before we headed back inside. Now we were bundled up, and we braved the weather. But after looking at all the lights, I noticed that in the middle of the trees there, there was a manger scene that was set up. They had Mary and Joseph and Baby Jesus. And then there was the shepherds and all the animals and everything. And there was a loudspeaker that they had playing a voice recording. It was a man's voice. And he was telling the story of the birth of Jesus. But not just telling the story. But he was reading from the Gospel of Luke Luke chapter two. And I just stood there listening to that. And more than being impressed with those lights, I was impressed by what I was hearing. Because here I am with my family, we're in this public place at one of the most popular hotels in the city. And the Word of God is being blared over the loud speaker. I don't know about you, but I have a lot of conflicting thoughts about this time of year. This is a time when people are thinking about talking about discussing the birth of Jesus. And of course, the reason this hotel would put a manger scene out front is because the the Christmas holidays approaching and they felt obviously feel like that is appealing or catering towards their guests. But this time of year can create some tension and varying thoughts within within us. And I've been thinking about this in terms of extremes. And so I liked it for us to think about the birth of Jesus this morning. And this idea of what is it that is unique or special about Jesus coming? When I think about the Christmas holiday, I think about that in terms of extremes. So this idea of CEOs and birthday cakes. If you heard the term of a CEO, not the leader of a company, but a CEO that stands for Christmas and Easter only. That is some people see Christmas as the highest and holiest day of the Christian calendar, so to speak. And sometimes you only see people on those certain days, they may never come to church, but they make a point to be there on Christmas. I also recently heard about some people who are getting together for a Christmas party and they wanted to have a birthday cake there. And on the cake, they put the words Happy birthday Jesus, and they were going to eat the cake and celebrate the birth of Christ. You don't have to be a New Testament scholar or an expert in the Bible to know that that's not something that the apostles and early disciples were doing. And so you have on the one side we feel like the birth of Christ has been commercialized, it's been tampered with. It's been sort of created into this thing that it was never intended to be. But then there's another extreme. And that is where we can sort of feel like that the birth of Jesus is something that we're timid about, almost like we're ashamed to even talk about it, because we don't want to be perceived in the wrong way.

I was with a group of young people, when I was in high school, and we were going to a nursing home where one of our members was staying. And we were singing some songs. And there was a group of people that were residents there at the nursing home that had come to listen. And one of the brothers that was with us, he asked if he could lead a song. And so he called out the number and we flipped in our books, and I looked down at the page. And I got to the song, and the song was, oh, come let us adore him. And the first thing that popped into my mind was, why are we singing the song? You know, people are gonna think that we're putting on some pageant out here that we're, this is the Christmas show, and that's what we're, we're here to do. And then later, I thought about it. And it was, it was a really weird thought that I had felt uncomfortable about singing a song about the birth of Jesus. And so you have these extremes. And so what are we to do with this? Well, here are some truths. The thing is, the Bible doesn't say anything about December 25, being the day that Jesus was born, that that particular date is not based on historical events or accuracy, from everything that we can tell. That day was selected because it coincided with other events, that winter solstice, there were pagan holidays during that time of year. And so there were some who felt like when people were converting to Christianity, it would be useful or helpful to have a so called Christian version of many of those festivals. And so they started to celebrate the birth of Christ around this time. Also, we don't read of any early Christians celebrating the birth of Jesus, the Apostles, the disciples, the New Testament writers, they don't say anything about giving special significance or placing importance on the birth of Christ. When the gospel was first preached, and the church was being established, we see that the emphasis was on the death, the burial, the resurrection of Jesus, that was the message that they were trying to get out. In Acts chapter 20, and verse seven, the disciples came together on the first day of the week to break bread to remember the death of Christ. But we don't find them reflecting on and celebrating his birth. But also notice this truth that the birth of Jesus is one of the most significant events in all of human history. The Gospels, Matthew and Luke give emphasis towards it. They give us details and specifics about what happened and how this occurred. The birth of Jesus was the fulfillment of many of the prophecies that God had made to his people throughout the Old Testament. And without the birth of Jesus, there is no life. There is no ministry, there's no teaching, there are no miracles of Jesus. Without the birth of Jesus, there is no death, burial, and resurrection. So this is the starting point for God's salvation coming in to the world. And finally, there are a lot of people that are thinking about the birth of Jesus this time of year. And so it's important for us as God's people to have a clear understanding, a good perspective on what this event means. Why is it significant? Why is it important? What does God want us to take away from these events? And as we understand that for ourselves, God willing, it would allow us to then have conversations and talk to other people not to shy away from this amazing event, but rather give give the proper emphasis and importance to it. What I'd like to do this morning is look at a couple of passages from the Gospels, where we see someone Telling or talking about the birth of Jesus. And think about this idea of what is so unique about this man, this person Jesus, what is it that made him so special? Let's start in Matthew chapter one, beginning in verse 18. Matthew chapter one and verse 18.

Conrad Harkrider  10:25
It says, Now the birth of Jesus Christ was as follows. After his mother, Mary was betrothed to Joseph before they came together, she was found with child of the Holy Spirit, than Joseph, her husband being adjustment, and not wanting to make her a public example was minded to put her away secretly. But while he thought about these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in the dream, saying, Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take to you marry your wife, for that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit, and she will bring forth a son, and you shall call his name Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins. So all this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the Lord through the prophets, saying, Behold, the virgin shall be with child and bear a son, and they shall call his name Immanuel, which is translated God with us. Then Joseph being aroused from sleep did as the angel the Lord commanded him and took him, took to him his wife, and did not know her till she had brought forth her firstborn son. And he called his name, Jesus. Joseph and Mary are engaged to one another. And Joseph later learned some very devastating news, his wife to be is pregnant, and it is not his child. Joseph doesn't want to publicly humiliate her. And he's trying to figure out a way that he can dissolve this relationship that he can put her away quietly. This speaks to his character. Matthew tells us that he was adjust man. And we also see that Joseph is not rushing to action here. He's thinking about these things. He's contemplating them. And as he's doing this, the Lord sends an angel to him. And notice what it says in verse 20. While he thought about these things, behold, an angel of the Lord appeared to him in a dream, saying, Joseph, son of David, do not be afraid to take to you marry your wife, or that which is conceived in her is of the Holy Spirit, we see that Jesus is unique, first of all, because he was conceived by the Holy Spirit. This birth, this pregnancy is no ordinary pregnancy. There are a number of samples in the Scriptures where there were couples, there were ladies who were having trouble getting pregnant, think about Hannah, in that situation where she was being ridiculed and persecuted because of her inability to conceive. And the Lord answered her prayer and opened her womb and gave her Samuel. Or what about Sarah, Sarah was long past the age of bearing children. And the Lord visited her and gave her when she bore Isaac, there were some unlikely and seemingly impossible situations where women had conceived that were told about in the scriptures, but nothing, nothing like this. An on married virgin, becoming pregnant by the power of the Holy Spirit. I wondered if Mary tried to try to explain this to Joseph before he had the dream from the angel. You know,

Conrad Harkrider  13:58
Joseph, this is actually a blessing. The this is going to be a good thing for you and me, and the whole world. It was no wonder that Joseph needed an angel to explain this to him. Because there had never been anything like this in the history of the world. The conception of Jesus was more than just improbable. It was miraculous. In verse 23, Matthew quotes from the prophet Isaiah who wrote over 700 years prior to this, and he foretells a time when A virgin would conceive and they would call his name Immanuel, which is God which means God with us. Being conceived by the Holy Spirit is more than just having God's favor and His power and His blessings. But this child that was being in for that was being formed inside of Mary would actually be divine, both God and man, a human body with a heavenly being inside the disciples, they came to understand this, that this was God in the flesh as they walked with Jesus, as they saw all the things that he did. The teaching he taught as one with authority, the miracles that he performed, he raised people from the dead healed those who were blind he called the seas. He forgave the sins of other people. And it's why in Matthew chapter 16, when Jesus asked the disciples who do people say that I am, who to use say that I am? In Matthew chapter 16, number 16, Simon Peter applied, you are the Christ, the Son of the living God, the identity of Jesus is of critical importance. This is not just a story about a, an unlikely couple that is able to have this child that did some good in the world. But rather, this is about God, entering into humanity. Every person living today has to decide whether Jesus was just a man, a good teacher, a prominent influential Jew, or was he something more, because if he is who he claimed to be, if he is who Matthew and the other writers say he was, then that demands that we follow His Word that demands that we submit our will, to him, understanding the identity of Jesus, he's after Simon Peter makes this confession. He says upon this, upon this understanding of who I am, that's what his church would be built upon. Jesus was more than a baby lying in a manger. It was the God who lives outside of time and space, willingly placing himself into human history. In Philippians, chapter two, and verse six, it says, though he was in the form of God, he did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied himself by taking the form of a servant being born in the likeness of men. Jesus was unique because he was in the form of God. But He entered in to our world and was conceived by the Holy Spirit. Also notice, verse 21. In our text, it says, and she will bring forth a son, and you will call His name Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins. Jesus is unique because he came to save people from their sins. This is a difficult situation for Mary and Joseph to be placed into this news that they receive. But there was one thing that was taken care of, for them one thing that they didn't have to worry about, and that was what to call this new baby. Because the angel tells them that his name is to be Jesus. That name has meaning and significance, it means salvation, or God saves. It's the same name as the Hebrew name Joshua,

Conrad Harkrider  18:21
this child would share the name of that deliverer who brought the children of Israel into the promised land to inherit the promises that God had made to it to them, but his name highlights the very purpose for which he came to save. Jesus is the Lord he is a king. And if you think about what are most kings focused on what are those who have power and authority, and and reign rain, what are they minded to do? They come to rule they come to conquer, they come to gain territory and strength. But Jesus was not interested in expanding the physical borders of an earthly kingdom, nor was he trying to amass some great army to overthrow the Roman government. It's why he told Pilate and John chapter 18, and verse 36, My kingdom is not of this world. His kingdom was spiritual in nature. And his focus was not on himself but on others. He came to save people. There were two brothers who became disciples of Jesus, James and John, they were fishermen by trade. And the Lord gave them a nickname. He called them the Sons of Thunder. There's an account in Luke chapter nine when Jesus was headed towards Jerusalem and he was wanting to stop in one of the villages of the Samaritans but they wouldn't receive Him and After being turned away, James and John asked the Lord they said, Do you want us to call down fire from heaven and consume these people? They're thinking in their minds, they've messed with the wrong Messiah. They don't know who they're up against. And so they wanted to destroy the place. But Jesus rebuked them. In John chapter three, in verse 17, Jesus said, For God did not send His Son into the world to condemn the world. But in order that the world might be saved through Him, Jesus came to save people. There are a lot of people who do some saving. Today I'm thinking about police officers, firefighters, National Guard, those amazing videos that we watch where this helicopter comes, and it lowered down the cable and they hook it on to somebody and pull them out of some type of terrible situation. And we're grateful for people who are trained with those types of skills that have the courage and the ability to go into those hopeless situations and pull people out. But notice what makes Jesus different and unique from any other person in human history is that he has the ability to save people from their sin. The Jews were longing for a Messiah that would deliver them from the Romans. But Jesus brought an even greater deliverance. He allowed people to be released from their sin. What Jesus offers is for people to be freed from the spiritual bonds and shackles of sin. It's important for us to realize from the very beginning, His purpose, His mission, his focus, was to save people from their sins. Jesus didn't come to end poverty. Jesus didn't come to end violence and war and persecution. He came to save us from our greatest enemy and disease, from our own sins. Why do we need Jesus not to make our life better here in this world? Why do we need Jesus not so we can get a better job or have a nice family or to live in comfort in this world, but we need Jesus because he's the only one that can heal our broken lives, and give us that true peace and hope for our future. When Jesus was born, the angels sing glory to God peace on earth. That peace comes because there is a relationship that's restored. When we're forgiven of our sins, we can have peace with God through Christ. Also notice our second text from Luke chapter two. In Luke chapter two and verse 28, Mary and Joseph bring Jesus in to the temple, they're going to present him in the temple. And there's a man there named Simeon who comes and receives him and gives this blessing to him. Luke chapter two, and verse 28. It says,

Conrad Harkrider  23:19
and it had been revealed to him by the Holy Spirit that He would not see death before he had seen the Lord's Christ. So it came by the Spirit into the temple. And when the parents brought in the child Jesus to do for him according to the custom of the law, he took him up in his arms and bless God and said, Lord, now You are letting your servant depart in peace, according to your word. For my eyes have seen your salvation, which you have prepared for the face of all peoples, a light to bring revelation to the Gentiles and the glory of your people Israel, and Joseph and his mother marveled at the things which were spoken of him. Then Simeon bless them and said to marry his mother, Behold, this child is destined for the fall and rising of many in Israel, and for a sign which will be spoken against. Yes, a sword will pierce through your own soul also, that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed. In verse 32, Simeon says that Jesus is unique because he is a light to the Gentiles. He is a light to the Gentiles is an interesting exchange between Joseph and Mary. They bring their child into the temple, this devout man, Simeon takes him in his arms. And he says that this child is going to be a blessing not only to the nation of Israel, but also to the entire world. In verse 31, he says that this has been prepared for the fate before the face of all peoples. Jesus was born to Jewish parents. He was brought up as a Jew he lived as Life as a Jew, but from the very beginning, his ministry and his purpose in coming was not just for the Jewish nation, but rather for all people, he would be a light and a hope, and good news for all men on earth from every nation. You know, in ancient times, there were many gods there were numerous gods that people worshiped. And they had gods for specific areas of life, and specific types of things. There was the god of the hills and the God of the valley, there was the god of the sea, and the God of the harvest, there was the god of the rain, and the God of love. But the God of the Bible is not limited to a specific type or area of life, not to a geographic region, he is the God of all creation. And when he sent his Son into the world, it was for the benefits and the blessing of all nations, and people. In Matthew chapter one, there's a genealogy that's given a family tree of this baby Jesus. And Matthew tells us, and gives us some interesting names in that list. He mentioned five different women, it wasn't common to have women listed in a genealogy, but Tamar Rahab, Ruth, the wife of Uriah, Bathsheba, and Mary are all mentioned in this list. And what's even more interesting about this is these women in the backgrounds that they came from, many of them have very clouded and shady past in history. And we know several of them were not even part of the nation of Israel. Rahab was a harlot from Jericho. Ruth was a Moabite, Bathsheba committed adultery with the king of Israel, and possibly was a Gentile, she was married to a Hittite. I think one of the reasons that Matthew includes them, is to show that Jesus came to save all kinds of people. He came to save people who were brought up reading the law of Moses. But he also came to save those who had no concept of who the true God really was. Those who for their entire lives had lived far apart from God and His ways. And so Matthew emphasizes that this would be a savior for all people. People today still think in terms of, of geography, they think of Jesus being the sort of the religion of the West Christianity. And then in the Middle East, you have Islam and Muhammad and then the Far East, you have Hindus and Confucian Confucianism. And we think in terms of, well, these different areas have they're different. They're, they're different beliefs.

Conrad Harkrider  28:10
But what makes Jesus unique is that he came as a light for the entire world. In John chapter three and verse 16. It says, For God so loved, not a specific region. For God so loved not a specific country or type of people or those who speak a certain languages. He says, For God so loved the world, that He gave His only Son that whoever believes in Him should not perish, but have eternal life. This story about Jesus is intended for all people today. And finally, notice verse 35. Luke chapter two and verse 35. In talking about what's going to happen to Mary, and the implications of this child, he says, yes, a sword will pierce through your own soul also, that the thoughts of many hearts may be revealed. Jesus is unique because he reveals the hearts he reveals the thoughts of many. Simeon is warning Mary and Joseph, that this son is going to be a controversial figure, that there are going to be many who rise and fall on account of Him. Many will be divided. Jesus himself said that brother would be put against brother, that children and their parents would be set at odds because of the things that he was teaching his message. His words produced a reaction. People either accepted the things that he said or they turned away. And we see this in the gospels often when people heard the word of Jesus, they were drawn to him. They wanted to hear more they clung to him, they followed him. And they wanted to be with him. And what the gospel show us is that many times those people were the outcasts of society, the tax collectors, the sinners, the prostitutes, those who were rejected by the religious authorities, but yet they were the ones who responded the Word of God, the message of the gospel, it revealed their hearts. And they wanted to know more, and they wanted to submit themselves and be with the Lord. But on the other side, you have those who when they heard Jesus, they rejected him. Even when they saw the miracles and the things that they were doing, they tried to attribute it to something else. They said, he's doing these things by the rule or by the power of the devil. And these were the religious elite. The scribes, the Pharisees, the experts in the law, those who saw themselves as righteous they didn't have a need for the Lord. Their hearts were revealed. This is the reason Jesus spoke in parables it was to separate the hearts. Those who didn't understand it didn't want to understand. were left in the dark. But those who truly desired to understand and know the meaning of these things, they were persistent, they continue to ask and seek the Lord. And so it is today it's true that Jesus exposes our true motives. His teaching shows, who we really are. When we read the Sermon on the Mount, we, we come face to face with our selfishness, with our lust with our greed with our evil desires. And in order to be right with God, we have to acknowledge those things and be willing to humbly ask God to forgive us. Jesus offers two paths, two choices to people. And ultimately, the Bible tells us that one day, every thought every, every word will be exposed, and we will be judged on account of the things that we have done in this life. And in Luke chapter eight and verse 17. It says, For nothing is hidden that will not be made manifest, nor is anything secret that will not be known and come to light.

Conrad Harkrider  32:30
Jesus came to save the world. But salvation is only extended to those who are willing to accept his message, repent of their sins, to put away their former way of living and submit themselves in trusting obedience to the Lord. We're going to close with an invitation song this morning and an opportunity for us to think about the importance, the significance of the life of Jesus. The fact that he was born into this world was an amazing event. But it wasn't just the birth of Jesus, it was the life and the ministry of Christ, that brought true light to the world. If you have a need this morning, and there's something that we can do to encourage you in your walk in your service to God if you need to put on Christ and baptism. You can make any of those needs known and come down to the front as together we stand and sing
