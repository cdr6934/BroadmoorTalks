If you want to open up your Bibles to the Old Testament, the book of Exodus chapter 18, Exodus 18.

I read recently that it's estimated that US companies spend about $60 billion a year on consulting services that is hiring another company to come in and provide guidance or insight. They usually ask firms that have specialized knowledge and things like a mergers and acquisitions or cybersecurity or how to cut costs. But they're willing to pay these very expensive high rates 200 to $700 an hour for consultants to come in and give them this feedback and direction with my kids. I feel like I'm constantly giving feedback and direction, although I'm the one who's paying $200 an hour. But the business environment is so competitive. And companies are willing to go to great lengths in order to stay relevant. And to stay in the race and it becomes pricey, but not all advice is expensive. Sometimes we cringe at the idea of someone saying can I give you some advice? Can I can I tell you something and we we sort of pause and say okay, they say you need to cut your hair or I don't like that shirt, or you need to clean your car. And at that point, we're thinking Have you talked to my mother because this is starting to sound very similar. But there is value in in receiving counsel isn't there in Proverbs chapter 11, verse 14, it says, where there is no guidance of people falls, but in the abundance of counselors, there is safety there is benefit in receiving and listening to wise counsel and advice. And this morning, I like to look at an account from the book of Exodus. When the children of Israel are camped before Mount Sinai, and Moses, his father in law, Jethro comes and offers him some advice. Read with me in Exodus 18, beginning in verse five.

Conrad Harkrider  02:36
It says in Jethro Moses, his father in law came with his sons and his wife to Moses in the wilderness where he was in camped at the mountain of God. Now he had said to Moses, I, your father in law, Jethro, I'm coming to you with your wife and her two sons with her. So Moses went out to meet his father in law bowed down and kissed him. And they asked each other about their well being, and they went into the tent. And Moses told his father in law, all that the Lord had done to Pharaoh into the Egyptians for Israel sake, all the hardship that had come upon them on the way, and how the Lord had delivered them, than Jethro rejoiced for the good which the Lord had done for Israel, whom he had delivered out of the hand of the Egyptians and Jethro Blut. And Jethro said, Blessed be the Lord who has delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians, and out of the hand of Pharaoh, and who has delivered the people from under the hand of the Egyptians. Now I know that the Lord is greater than all gods, for in the very thing in which they behave proudly, he was above them. Then Jethro, Moses, his father in law took a bird offering and other sacrifices to offer to God. And Aaron came with all the elders of Israel to eat bread with Moses, his father in law before God. And so it was on the next day that Moses sat to judge the people. And the people stood before Moses from morning until evening. So when Moses his father in law saw all that he did for the people, he said, What is this thing that you are doing for the people? Why do you alone sit and all the people stand before you from morning until evening. And Moses said to his father in law, because the people come to me to inquire of God, when they have a difficulty, they come to me and I judge between one and another, and I make known the statutes of God and His laws. So Moses, his father in law said to him, the thing that you do is not good. Both you and these people who are with you will surely wear yourselves out for this thing is too much for you. You are not able to perform it by yourself. Listen now to my voice, I will give you counsel and God will be with you stand before God for the people so that they may bring the difficulty so that you may bring the difficulties to God. And you shall teach them the statutes and the laws and show them the way in which they must walk and the work they must do. Moreover, you shall select from all the P people able men such as fear God, men of truth, hating covetousness, and place them over them to be rulers of 1000s rulers of hundreds rulers of 50s and rulers of tins, and let them judge between the people at all times. And it will be that every great matter that they bring to you, but every small matter, they themselves shall judge. So it will be easier for you and they will bear the burden with you. If you do this thing, and God so commands you, then you will be able to endure and all this people will also go to their place in peace. So Moses heated the voice of his father in law, and did all that he said,

Conrad Harkrider  05:44
Israel has just been delivered out of Egyptian bondage. They've traveled through the wilderness, they've come to Mount Sinai, which is referred to in verse five as the mountain of God. We also read about the mountain of God and chapter three of Exodus, we read about that, when Moses is leading his herds around that side of the mountain, and he encounters the burning bush. But now the people are camped here and there's a special visitor that comes to meet with Moses, his father in law, and he's bringing his wife, Moses, his wife and his two children. At some point, we're not sure how all this happened. But Moses, his wife, and his two kids, they head back to their homeland, possibly because Moses didn't want them to accompany him back to confront one of the most powerful kings in all the earth. Maybe it was for their protection, but whatever the case, now they are coming back. And there is this anticipated reunion. Jethro is not just an ordinary sheep herder verse one of chapter 18 tells us that he was the priest of Midian. In fact, he comes to Moses, verse 12, says that they went, and he offers up burnt offerings and sacrifices to God. The last time we read about a burnt offering being offered up was back in Genesis 22, when Abraham offered up the RAM in place of his son, Isaac. So Jethro appears to hold this special place of distinction. Also, notice in verse 12, that they eat a meal together, they take bread, all of the elders come Aaron, and they eat before God. Notice what Moses tells him, in verse eight. He says, he talks about at the end of verse eight how the Lord had delivered them. And he says, he tells him all that the Lord had done. He recounts the incredible deliverance, all the mighty things that God had done the plagues that he had brought upon the Egyptians, how he rescued them from the hand of Pharaoh. After leaving Egypt, they had encountered some difficulties, they had been met with some circumstances that were very challenging. And yet at the end of verse eight, the Lord had delivered them. Moses and his testimony to his father in law stands in contrast to what the rest of the congregation of Israel were thinking about God during this time, because they seem to quickly forget the great power that God had displayed. And because of that, it resulted in them grumbling, and complaining, and chapter 16. They say, We don't have enough food. And so God says the manner in chapter 17, they say, we're going to die of thirst, and then God provides water from the rock. They didn't trust that God would provide. But here Moses says, we encountered hardship and God delivered us he took care of us. In verses 10 and 11. Jethro offers up a blessing to the Lord Blessed be the Lord who has delivered you out of the hand of the Egyptians. In verse 11. He says, Now, I know that the Lord is greater than all the gods, Jethro didn't see everything that had happened. He didn't witness the crossing of the Red Sea, there was no pictures, Moses can show him the clip or the video of everything that took place. But yet he believed based upon the testimony of eyewitnesses, that's similar to what we do today. We didn't see Jesus risen from the dead and yet we have solid faith, because of the account of the apostles and the other eyewitnesses who did see these things. After they worship together, and they go into the tent and catch up on recent events and and talk about various things. Jethro decides Stay a little bit longer. It's kind of like your mother and father in law. They come in for the weekend. And then Monday rolls around and they're still there, Jethro hangs around for a little bit, he's gonna watch how Moses goes about his work.

Conrad Harkrider  10:14
And he notices in verse 13, that Moses is judging the people from morning until evening. This is not just a couple of phone calls during the day, Moses is working from sun up to sundown, and the people just keep coming. In Exodus chapter 12, and verse 37, we're told that the number of people that came out of the land of Egypt was about 600,000 men on foot, and that puts the total congregation estimates around 2 million people. So they all this this huge group, this huge number, every time they have an issue or dispute, they are coming to one man, they're coming to Moses. Jethro sees this and he he says, What are you doing? Why are you doing this? And Moses basically says, well, when the people have a need, and they need to know what God thinks about it, they come to me and I inquire of the Lord, I tell them about the laws. And I judge between them. When I was in college, there was a friend who had this piece of property and we would go out there for various things. And one time, we went out to have a bonfire. And I was out there early, getting things set up and had this huge metal ring that we're going to use for a fire pit, but we wanted to move it from one side of the property to the other. And so me and another friend, were there first, and we decided that we could, we could handle this thing, we could lift it up, right, we were young. And we got up under this, this huge hunk of iron and must have been for 500 pounds, and we're straining, my back is about to go out, my legs are burning, and feel like I'm going to drop it and all of a sudden another guy walks up and I'm kind of expecting him to jump in there to save us, help us out. And he looks at us and he says why don't you just roll it over there. And we thought, well, I didn't think of that. That didn't even cross my mind. Sometimes from the outside, an outside perspective can see a situation more clearly. Right? The answer is so much. It's very obvious what should be done. And that's what we see with Jethro here in verse 17. He says the thing that you are doing is not good. Verse 18, he says you're gonna wear yourself out trying to go about this business, taking all the people all day long, it's not good for you, and it's not good for the people, you're not going to be able to keep this pace.

Conrad Harkrider  12:49
Then Jethro proceeds to give Moses some advice. And that's what I want to focus on for the rest of our time. This morning, notice verse 19. What he says it's advice for Moses. And it's also great advice for us. Today, Moses, he says to Moses in verse 19, listen now to my voice, I will give you counsel, and God will be with you. stand before God for the people so that you may bring the difficulties to God. And you shall teach them the statutes and the laws and show them the way in which they must walk. Jethro tells Moses that he needs to teach the statutes of God, not only should Moses be hearing the cases that come before him, and and judging between these conflicts, but he also needs to educate the people to guide them to instill knowledge within them. People need to understand the laws and the rules for themselves. It wasn't enough for Moses just to be the experts in the law, the children of Israel needed to have these things inside of their hearts. And that's important because if they understood and knew the law of God, they wouldn't have to rely on Moses to decide every dispute to constantly be telling them. They could. Jethro emphasizes the teaching, to help the people to know what Moses knows. And knowledge of God is is so critical. So important. You think about throughout history, the most of the population of the world has not had the ability to relate to read. And that meant that people were dependent upon someone else for knowledge for education. And in the church. That meant that people couldn't read the scriptures. The Bible was only translated a couple of languages. So people had to rely on someone else, to tell them about what God's Word had to say. And that created a lot of problems. There's a lot of Miss Information. Unfortunately, we don't live in a time where God's word is, in a language we don't understand the Bible has been translated in over 600 languages. We haven't at our fingertips. It's so close the word is so close to us. But the question is, do we rely on others for our knowledge and understanding of God's Word? Do we, we lean on the preacher, the elders, the teachers, mom and dad, the matriarch or patriarch of the family. Whenever we played Bible trivia, you always wanted pap on your team. It was like a guaranteed victory. Because he knew the word he had studied. He, he knew the scriptures backwards and forwards. I remember one time I told him, I said, I wish I could download all that knowledge that you have in your brain. And he looked at me really seriously. And he said, Where do you think I got this knowledge. I said, you downloaded it from someone else. Of course, not years of reading and meditating and teaching and talking with others, about God's word it needs to be in my heart.

Conrad Harkrider  16:06
And thinking about teaching statutes of God if we're in a position of influence over other people, if I'm a parent, or a grandparent, or an aunt or uncle or mentor or teacher, we need to be focused on imparting and sharing God's word. With younger generations. When you get together with kids, the kids in your family kids that are in your community or or at your school, asking them questions, getting them thinking about God's Word, the younger kids asking them Bible trivia what happened to Joseph, tell me the story of Joseph, tell me about the 10 lepers that came to Jesus, what, who went to prepare the body of Jesus for burial? Get them thinking about God's word as they get older, the lessons and the the implications will will go deeper. But let's make our conversations when we're with our family. Let's make it more than about presence and technology and sports and food, but keep the Word of God front and center on our minds. Also, notice what he says in verse 21. Exodus 1821. Moreover, you shall select from all the people able men, such as fear God, men of truth, hating covetousness, and place them, them to be rulers over 1000s and hundreds and 10s. He tells Moses that he needs to look for capable men, he needs to search among the congregation identify men who are qualified and able, these are men who will be going to be placed in positions of leadership, they're going to be given responsibility. And did you notice the qualities that Jethro emphasizes, it's not that they're supposed to be tall and good with a sword, or that they need to be wealthy, and they come from a respected family, or these need to be men who are educated, and they're very intellectual. They're smart. No, he says that we need men who fear God. Men who have a respect for the Lord, they honor and revere him in their life. In their conduct, they submit their will and their desires to him, they lift up the Lord, and not themselves. He says they need to be men of truth, they speak the truth, they don't approve of things that are false. They don't hide or conceal things. They are honest and transparent. If they tell you something, if they say, I think this is a good idea, or I support you in this, then you know that that is genuine, that they are being real, and what they say they are trustworthy. They can be counted on if they give. If you give them a task, or ask them to do something, you can depend upon them, you know, that they're going to follow through. And finally, there are men that hate covetousness. Not only are they unwilling to take a bribe or to be paid off, but they have an absolute disdain for this type of behavior. They hate greed. They're strongly opposed to dishonest gain, or whether that's taking money from someone charging too much being deceitful about money or about how much something costs. They hate covetousness and these are the qualities that Jethro advises Moses to seek out in these men they were needed back then for service and they are needed today. Men who stand with integrity they don't have a price they do the right thing. for the right reasons men who have character. Character is not something that develops overnight. We go to bed one night we wake up next morning with great integrity and character. It happens over time. It's a process and his parents said and grandparents are we? Are we emphasizing the qualities and the characteristics that God places great significance or great emphasis on? are we raising kids that hate covetousness? That hate dishonest gain?

Conrad Harkrider  20:18
Are we focused on just on good grades? Are we teaching them about respect for authority? Is it all about winning the game? Or do we emphasize hard work and humility and unselfishness? Do we spend too much time worrying about their appearance and external things are? Are we teaching them about kindness, and compassion and service? Jethro tells Moses, you need men who are capable, capable for service. Also, look at verse 22. He says, let them judge between the people at all times, then it will be that every great matter that they shall bring to you. But every small matter they, they themselves shall judge so it will be easier for you for they will bear the burden with you. Jethro tells Moses that you need to share the work, allow these capable men to bear the burden with you. This seems similar to a judicial system where you have lower courts and then higher courts, and it goes up all the way to the Supreme Court. And the smaller matters can be handled on a local level and things that are more difficult or complicated, they work their way up the system. And this will allow Moses to have to hear less cases and reduce the burden that is on him, share the work, lighten the load, it's not always an easy thing to do. We tell ourselves if I want something done right, then I'm just gonna have to do it. myself. I remember helping my grandmother with watering the plants. And she showed me what I needed to do, she took me out there. And she said, these are the ones that need watering. And this is how much water you're supposed to put in there. And she showed me how to hold the hose and how to turn it off. And then she went back in the house and I went out there and I watered the plants. And I watered the patio furniture and I watered the side of the house. Because those needed watering too. Sometimes we delegate a task to someone, and they do it a little differently. They make mistakes. But that shouldn't prevent us from handing things off, maybe it just takes some additional time to teach them. Maybe it means that we need to have more patience to work with them to train them because in the long run, it's better for us. And for them. As my wife I know how to water plants now. In Acts chapter six were told about a situation that came up in the early church with the some of the widows who were being neglected in the daily distribution. And when the problem came to the attention of the apostles, you know what they did? They said, Guys, we need to come together, we just need to start working some overtime, we need to stay late. We need to work weekends, we just need to get it done. No, that's not what they did. They said this is an important work. But we need to find some men who can have charge over it. And they appointed the seven men who were capable, capable men so that they could oversee that part of the ministry and they could focus their efforts on something else. In the body of Christ, there should be a sharing and collaboration. We don't want 80% of the work being done by five or 10 people. And that can be common with elders or preachers or other workers in the church where they end up getting asked to do just about everything, somebody needs a ride from the airport, call the preacher, he can take care of it. We have so many people who have a mind and a heart to serve. But let me encourage you to share that work. Share that work. Ask someone to come with you encourage a young person to help you we have 50 plus kids of this congregation. I know some of them are still in diapers and whatnot. But in a few years, we should have 50 plus helpers, people who can share in the work. I think about the times that I've served in the past that hasn't usually been because I came up with a great idea and said I'm gonna go and implement this. More often it is an older Christian who sees a need and says Come with me. Go visit this person. Take on this this teaching, whatever it may be, because when every part does it share it causes growth of the body. Ephesians 416. Finally, notice verse 24. It says emoted Moses heeded the voice of his father in law and did all that he said is the most important part of the of the account here. Jethro offers up all this advice. But Moses listens to wise counsel. Think about The relationship here the father in law is mentioned seven or eight times in this text, it just keeps saying that father in law father in law, this would have been a unique situation here, the relationship with the father in law is not always the easiest one to take guidance and counsel. And in addition to that Moses is in a pretty prominent position, right? He's just up ended this powerful king and Pharaoh, he's been given all of this power, he can turn his staff into a snake and he can park the waters of the Red Sea. And he's done all of these plagues. And it wouldn't have been out of the out of question for him to say, look, Jethro, that's, that's a nice thought. But I've got this covered, right, I know what I'm doing here, the people need to come to me. Moses wasn't interested in trying to hold the power or become the king of the people or the dictator. But instead, he wanted to do what was right. And he had a soft and receptive heart. Also, it's interesting that God doesn't just call down to Moses and say, you need to change the way you're, you're judging the people, right? This perspective, this advice comes from another man, in this case, his father in law. Do we realize that God uses godly men and women today to provide guidance and counsel, they are often older, sometimes they're younger, but they come to us. And they may see something that we're doing a correction that we need to make some area of weakness or maybe immaturity that we're exhibiting. And they bring that to us, we need to be receptive. None of us know exactly how we're supposed to walk how we're supposed to live in this world. And that's the benefit of the Body of Christ. We have brothers and sisters who are older, who have walked through things who have lived through things and they can share that perspective, and that Godly counsel, in Proverbs chapter 12, and verse 15, it says the way of a fool is right in his own eyes, but a wise man listens to advice.

Conrad Harkrider  27:10
Even Moses, a man who spoke with God face to face as a man speaks to his own friend. Even he was willing to hear the counsel of someone else. And so for us today, we need to think about do we have people around us that offer guidance? Do we have a mentor? Do we have somebody that can, we can bounce things off of that can give us that feedback? It doesn't always have to come from someone we're close to, but we need to be receptive and open to counsel. Well, this advice holds true for us today. We need to learn, to teach, look, share and listen. Is our heart open and willing to change? Whether it's a brother and sister or whether our heart is touched by the things that have been brought to us from the Word of God? Are we willing to receive the instruction and the guidance that comes from God and from his people? If there's something that we can do to encourage you and your walk with Christ, we offer an extended invitation please come down to the front and make your needs known as we stand and sing
