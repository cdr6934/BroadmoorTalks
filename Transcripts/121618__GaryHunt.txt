is a blessing as it always is. And to be able to come together and see one another face to face, and worship and praise the Lord and enter into this time together where we can offer praise and be edified by his word. And remember his son, and his sacrifice. We're thankful for your continued help and for your prayers and encouragement, and support as we labor in the Gospel. And we are blessed that we continue to see people even in the darkest of areas, and by dark, I mean spiritually dark, who are eager to seek and know the truth. We have to ya why I say young as far as the faith is concerned, sisters in Christ in Brooklyn, and two in the Philippines that have young sisters in Christ that have been brought to the Lord this year by the power of the gospel. And we are thankful. And it just shows that under whatever conditions there may be, it is still the gospel that is God's power to save it is not us. It is not us. It is the gospel, the gospel of his grace. But we pay if I continue talking about all of the what I would talk about, then the lesson would not be taught. So I want to call your attention to a brief lesson tonight. That is taken from Colossians chapter four and verse 12, and 13, which we'll read in just few moments. And in that passage, we read about someone who always Labor's earnestly for you in his prayers. And that's what we have in mind for tonight's lesson. If we are not careful, the habit of saying prayers becomes just an empty ritual. To which little time is given it doesn't doesn't mean too much. Also, prayer is often seen as a desperate act, that is an act of last resort when nothing else can be done, especially in cases of sickness or in cases of great disaster. Therefore, prayer becomes just relegated to a task that it doesn't take much time. And it's not associated with earnest labor with strenuous effort. But in the Word of God, we read differently about prayer. In the scriptures, prayer is revealed as a continuous, fervent, fervent labor. It's a strenuous labor, as strenuous as any activity that we do, as a matter of faith. It is to be done on behalf of others as well not only in regard to sickness, but in regard to spiritual maturity. Time and Effort is to be placed in praying for each other. Because there's a loving, merciful, powerful, gracious God, that is waiting to answer our prayers and to do more than we could ever imagine that he would do. Like all aspects of our Christian life, prayer is an agonizing struggle not agonizing, because we hate it, but agonizing because that is the intensity of effort that we must put forth in prayer if we are to gain from it. If we are to gain the blessings of God from it, it will become an agony, a strong strenuous effort that we make. What could this man do for the people that he loved that he had brought to Christ, being hundreds of miles away? And under house arrest in Rome with the apostle Paul, what could he possibly do to help his beloved brethren in the city of Colossi?

Unknown Speaker  04:43
Well, we read about the man Epaphras the brother in Christ Colossians four and verse 12 Colossians four and verse 12 Epaphras, who is one of your number a bond slave of Jesus Christ? Christ sends you his greetings always laboring earnestly for you in his prayers, that you may stay you may stand perfect and fully assured in all the will of God. For I testify for him that he has a deep concern for you and for all those who are in Laodicea and her propolis he said he labors earnestly for you in his prayers, even hundreds of miles away, not able to see you not able to encourage you, not able to build you up face to face not able to serve in your lives face to face, he Labor's earnestly for you in his prayers. He agonizes for you continually in his prayers. And fact that word if we looked at word translated labor earnestly laboring earnestly, if that word is looked up, then you will read the same thing that I'm reading from Mr. Thayer the word Agon. agonizer. May me and you can guess that's where we get our words agony. agonize, and Mr. Thayer defined it thusly, to enter a contest, contend in the gymnastic games to contend with an adversary has to fight metaphorically to contend struggle with difficulties and dangers, to endeavor with strenuous zeal, to strive to obtain something? Do we usually think of that type of effort when it comes to prayer? I don't. I don't, I haven't. But this man put forth that type of effort, this brother in Christ, put forth that type of effort in prayer toward the Colossians and those in the surrounding cities that had come to Christ, praying for their spiritual maturity, that they might be brought made complete in Christ, that they might not fall away from the faith that they might grow stronger in faith, filled with the knowledge of God and fruitful in His service. Who is this man Epaphras he was a Colossians, one of your number, and Colossians four and verse 12. He was one of their number and it is he as we alluded to, that had brought them first the gospel that he had brought the Gospel of Christ to Colossi. Colossians one and verse seven. And Colossians one and verse seven, just as you learned hid the gospel from a papyrus, our beloved fellow bond servant, who is a faithful servant of Christ on our behalf, and he also informed us of your love in the Spirit. He was the one who brought the Gospel there and saw many converts to Christ, whatever the number was, and the church was established there. And Philemon verse 23 Philemon verse 23, Epaphras, my fellow prisoner in Christ Jesus great shoe, he was a prisoner with the apostle Paul in Rome under house arrest, waiting, while awaiting the sentence, whether they would be released or executed, at least in Paul's case. And he was suffering because he dared to be a Christian. He dared to stand up and preach the gospel openly be a Christian openly seek to spread the gospel to idolaters and Jews alike.

Unknown Speaker  09:19
And for that he was imprisoned with the Apostle Paul not only did a path for his labor strenuously agonizingly for the Colossians in his prayer, but Paul had not even met any of these brethren except for a path Epaphras he had not been to Colossi and yet he labored strenuously also, for them in his prayers being under house arrest, what could he do for these Christians? Colossians one and verse nine Colossians one and verse nine. For this reason also, Paul says, since the day we heard of it of your conversion to Christ, we have not ceased to pray for you. We have not ceased to pray for you and to ask that you may be filled with the knowledge of his will and all spiritual wisdom and understanding.

Unknown Speaker  10:23
Do you ever pray that for your brethren that is a prayer. Not just have some knowledge to be filled with all knowledge and understanding

Unknown Speaker  10:39
and wisdom, so that you will walk in a manner worthy of the Lord to please Him, and all respects bearing fruit and every good work, and increasing in the knowledge of God, not only filled with the knowledge of God, but continuing to increase in the knowledge of God strengthened with all power, according to his glorious might for the attaining of all steadfastness and patience, joyously giving thanks to the Father who has qualified us to share in the inheritance of the saints in light. For he rescued us from the domain of darkness, and transferred us to the kingdom of his beloved Son, in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins. That is a wonderful prayer, is it not? But it's something that he kept doing. It's not just something that oh, yeah, that's a wonderful prayer Brother, how last just a few verses, is that what you got out of it? He said he did not cease to make these prayers. It was a continual habitual effort on the Apostle Paul's behalf, who had never seen these people, never seen these brethren, but love them, but loves them and wanted them to continue in the faith, whether he ever saw them or not, whether he could ever meet them or not on this side of heaven. He wanted them to continue to be strengthened by the gospel and grow in the grace and knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ. And so he sent a letter back to them, the Colossian letter, the Colossian letter to them and to be shared with the Church at Laodicea. And her rappeler sent around about hey, not only prayed for those whom he did not had never met, but he taught them by writing this letter to the Colossians one and verse 28 Colossians one and verse 28, right. We've proclaim Him Paul said, Christ, we proclaim Him admonishing every man and teaching every man with all wisdom, so that we may present every man complete in Christ. For this purpose, also I labor striving. If we looked at the word striving, it would be the same Greek word and Colossians four and verse 12. It would be the word agonizing, agonizing according to His power, which mightily works within me. Paul said, my goal is not just to bring people to be baptized into Christ. My growth goal is to bring people to be completed in Christ by maturing in the faith and being fruitful, and every good work of Christ. And that is not only for those who have I have met, but for those who I have never seen, and so he taught, labored in teaching not only praying but teaching them to bring them to maturity by this letter. Colossians two and verse one, continue, for I want you to know how greatest struggle I have on your behalf and for those who are at Laodicea. And for all those who have not personally seen my face, that their hearts may be encouraged having been knit together in love, and attaining the all the wealth that comes from the full assurance of understanding resulting in a true knowledge of God's mystery that is Christ Himself.

Unknown Speaker  14:50
Christ Himself, in whom are hidden all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge as say this that no one will delude you with persuasive arguments for even though I'm absent in body. Nevertheless, I'm with you in spirit, rejoicing to see your good discipline, and the stability of your faith in Christ. Therefore, as you have received Christ, Jesus the Lord, so walk in Him, live in him, walk in him, according to the Gospel, having been firmly rooted and now being built up in him and established in your faith, just as you were instructed, and overflowing with gratitude. He not only prayed earnestly for them, but he taught earnestly writing the letter and sending it to them so that they might be built up and matured even more in the faith. But what do we learn from this? What do we learn? We learn that our Christian life, including prayer, is a continual labor. It takes great effort, agonizing effort, not because we hate it, but because we love it. We love it. And we want to put all of our effort into it. Jesus said in Luke chapter 13, and verse 24, Luke chapter 1313, and verse 24. Strive. Is it that word again? Yes, agonize to enter through the narrow gate, the narrow door for many I tell you will seek to enter and will NOT be able. It's that word again. Is it not? Yes. Yes, labor earnestly, agonize strive to serve Me Jesus said, Put a great strenuous effort in serving me. That's what he said. Then we find the apostle Paul, First Timothy four in verse seven. First Timothy four in verse seven, the apostle Paul but have nothing to do he says to Timothy with worldly fables, First Timothy four, seven, fit only for old women. On the other hand, discipline yourself. The old King James says, exercise yourself for the purpose of godliness of pleasing God above all, for a bodily discipline bodily exercises only have little profit, but godliness pleasing God above all is profitable for all things, since it holds promise for the present life and also for the life to come. No gym membership is gonna give you eternal life. No bodily exercise is gonna give us eternal life. It is the spiritual exercise. learning and applying the gospel in our daily lives, including praying that is going to grant us eternal life. Verse nine of Chapter Four First Timothy, it is a trust worthy statement. deserving full acceptance, for it is for this we labor and Agathe eyes. Strive, same word. As we read in the beginning, we labor and we strive we agonize, because we have fixed our hope on the living God, who is the Savior of all men, especially of believers, especially of believers. So the last words that are written by the Apostle Paul, Second Timothy, chapter four in verse six, if history is true, before he would be executed in some fashion by the Romans. Paul said I'm ready to depart. I'm ready to leave this life and go to the next.

Unknown Speaker  19:50
Second Timothy four in verse six for I am already being poured out as a drink offering and the time of my departure my Death has come. I have fought the good fight. I have agonized, the good fight. I have finished the course. I have kept the faith. In the future there is laid up for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord, the righteous judge will award to me on that day and not only to me, but to all who have loved His appearing. Paul said, I've agonized in the good fight of faith. I've fought spiritually.

Unknown Speaker  20:41
Has it been a struggle? Yes. But is it worth it all? Yes. And then we come back to prayer. Then we come back to prayer. Not only is our whole Christian life and agonizing but joy, your struggle, but prayer would be included in that, especially praying for one another.

Unknown Speaker  21:09
There is an interesting passage, but long before Paul wrote the Colossian letter, he wrote the letter to the Romans. And at the end, near the end of the Roman letter, and Romans 15, and verse 30. Romans 15 And verse 30, and somebody who has far greater opportunity I did this long ago and a lesson but some eager individual who would like to explore it or any Christian for that matter. Listen to these verses and see how these verses parallel acts. Chapters 21 to the end of the of X. Paul says in verse 30, Romans 15. Now I urge you, brethren, by our Lord Jesus Christ, and by the love of the Spirit to agonize together with me. Same word, as labor earnestly strive, agonize, together with me in your prayers, in your prayers to God for me, that I may be rescued for those who are disobedient in Judea. That would be x 21, would it not? A you double check that and that my service for Jerusalem may prove acceptable to the saints that would be x 21. Then what else does he say? So that I may come to you enjoy by the will of God that would be coming to Rome, would it not? And that I may find refreshing rest in your company. Now the God of peace, be with you all. Amen. That in that tell us the happenings of acts 21 through 28. And how Paul believed that all of that was not only a result of God working in those events, but the prayers of the saints on his behalf, that these things might take place. How did he finally come to Rome? He came as a prisoner of Caesar, protected from the Jews but facing jeopardy of the Roman twisted justice, to put it mildly. Did he find refreshing company among the Roman saints, even under house arrest, he was freely able to see the saints because they allowed him to do so isn't that wonderful? agonize with me in your prayers, they mean something. They mean something. Sometimes, I wonder, trying to be in Philippines at the same time if my body could stand it, which is another story but sometimes I don't know if my body can stand New York I it's hard to figure out where my body can stand. I don't know if anybody feels that way or not, at times. But that reminds us that flesh and blood does not inherit the kingdom of God. So we're not bothered as much by that. But we wondered what can we do for brethren so far away who we love, who we agonize over and we, if we're not careful become anxious about make that agony, a prayer. Not only a one time prayer, but a habitual prayer, not not a small prayer, but a big prayer about that they may overcome the temptations of Satan that they may be filled more with the knowledge of Christ and be fruitful in his service be strengthened by his gospel so that they can be more light and salt in the world making a big, big prayer and continue. And then I think about is it just the saints far away that I'm to be agonizing over in my prayer? Or what about the saints in my local congregation?

Unknown Speaker  25:53
What about them? What about them? Don't you think that we ought to agonize in prayer over one another? And don't you think

Unknown Speaker  26:10
that the Lord is more powerful than we are? To bring about spiritual maturity and others if we depend more upon him, rather than just depending on ourselves and our abilities? We need to agonize over each other elders for the flock, flock for the elders flock about the flock. Parents regarding children, children regarding parents, spouses, about spouses. There's a lot of praying to be done isn't there? There is a lot of praying to be done. And the gracious powerful God will hear and will answer in his own time. And the mysterious, powerful gospel mysterious because we don't understand how the Word of God grows. We understand that it's the power to save and changes. But none of us understand how it grows. And when I say mysterious, that's what I mean. The mysterious, powerful gospel as it grows and changes is what is a wonder to behold. James chapter five and verse 14, as we begin to draw to a close, James five and verse 14, is anyone among you sick, then he must call for the elders and of the church, and they are to pray over him, anointing him with all in the name of the Lord. And the prayer offered in faith will restore the one who is sick, and the Lord will raise him up. And if he has committed sins, they will be forgiven him. But then he says, verse 16, therefore confess your sins to one another, and pray for one another, so that you may be healed. The effective prayer of a righteous man can accomplish much. That's because God can do all things, all things that are good God can and will do. And so I'll leave you with this and leave myself with the same challenge. Do we labor in prayer as we would any other part of our Christian life? Or do we just labor in our teaching? Is that where all the labor is? Is that we're all of it is in our teaching or another pursuits? Or do we labor also as strenuously in our prayers for one another? Do we work for and pray for the maturing of one another in Christ? A lot of church difficulties would be overcome. If we take that to heart and pray for the spiritual maturity of one another continually, a lot of things would be overcome. If that be the case, prayer is a great but agonizing work of faith. It's deserving our attention, our time and our effort, and a gracious, loving, merciful, powerful God. He'll answer if we humble ourselves by laboring earnestly in prayer, He will answer in his time to His glory, by his glorious power of the gospel, working In us working and those for whom we pray, working in us, as we pray for others. There's a lot of labor to be done. And we're thankful that the Lord gives us that opportunity. Let us spend more time and effort in prayer. And let us watch the Lord's hand at work, doing all things for good to those who love God. You're here tonight and not a child of God, we would encourage you to turn your life over to the Lord Jesus, it's his you know, already, I don't know if you recognize it took me a long time to recognize it. But your life is his already all souls are mine. As EQAO says God is the Father of spirits where God's creation created in His image. We belong to Him in the absolute sense, but he wants us to be saved and turn away from those things that are destroying our lives and separating us from him. Those sins, and He sent Jesus to die for our sins so that we might be saved and raised Him from the dead, and seated Him at His right hand ruling over Heaven and Earth where he is now.

Unknown Speaker  31:33
Don't fight against Jesus. That's a losing battle. Love Jesus, because He loves you. He loves all and wants all to be saved if you're willing to trust in Jesus, believing in him enough to repent of your sins and confess his name before men as the Son of God and be baptized, immersed in water for forgiveness of sins tonight, then all there would be so much rejoicing not only here, but in heaven as well over a lost soul being brought back from the brink of eternal destruction. Why not do that tonight before it's too late and those of us who are Christians, Let us repent and pray, confess our sins to God. Pray for forgiveness that we might be brought back by his grace through His cleansing blood. That we may begin to grow and begin to labor in the Christian life and cooking including praying for others as well. You're here tonight and subject to that gospel invitation. We encourage you to come once you come as we stand and as we sing Let us stand
