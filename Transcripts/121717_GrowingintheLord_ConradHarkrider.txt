If you'd like to turn in your Bibles to First Peter chapter two

Conrad Harkrider  00:17
that's where we're going to start tonight. First Peter chapter two.

Conrad Harkrider  00:26
When I was young man, probably around my freshman year of high school, I started to become very keenly aware of how tall I was. And that was partly because of, of sports, it's a advantage if you're, if you're tall for basketball, football, and pretty much, you know, every sport, there's some benefits of, of being tall. And then there was also this girl thing, I don't know, just being the shortest person in the grade was kind of a challenge, you know, having to look up to all the girls that you were interested in. But I started tracking this. And because I wanted to see how much progress I was making, my dad was six to my brother, around six foot, I had an uncle that was over six foot. So I felt like my chances of being tall were were pretty good. And at the time, I was around five, five or so. So it was started to measure my progress. So every day, I would, at night, stand up against the wall, and I had a little push pin that I would stick in the wall behind me. And then the next day, I'd do the same thing. And usually the hole would be right about exactly where it was the day before. And so my older brother, he kind of jokingly said, he said, Well, why don't you give it a week or two, you know, give it a little time and see if that makes any difference. And so I did, I waited a couple of weeks and same thing, the hole was not moving up or down. And so at the end of the day, I didn't ever make it to six foot. As you can see, I topped out at five nine and was still able to find a girl that likes me. So that was a success. But tonight, I want to talk to you about growth. And although God does care about our physical growth, and he wants us to be whole and complete, there is this aspect of spiritual growth that is mentioned throughout the scriptures. And that ultimately should be our our focus, the thing that we place emphasis on how are we maturing and growing spiritually. And I thought we'd start in First Peter chapter two. In verse one, Peter talks about this idea of growth. First Peter chapter two and verse one. He says, Therefore, laying aside all malice, all deceit, hypocrisy, envy, and evil speaking, As newborn babes, desire, the pure milk of the word, that you may grow there by if indeed you have tasted, that the Lord is gracious. Peter talks about he makes this comparison or this analogy to newborn babies. And most of us if not all of us have been around babies or seen babies and understand that process of how they have to be fed on a pretty routine, ongoing basis, when they're first born, it's about every three hours that they're expecting to be to get some of the milk that they need, and then it starts to spread out as as they mature, but that is vital for them, they can't survive without it. And in order for them to continue to progress and, and develop and gain the skills and abilities to grow to maturity, they have to have that mill computer says that for the Christian. The milk that we need, is the word he says that we would desire the pure milk of the word. So

Conrad Harkrider  04:23
just a couple of quick points here to start, first of all, see that growth is not something that happens by accident. This desiring or this partaking of the milk of the of the word, that's something that is an intentional action. It's something that we seek out. And it's it doesn't just happen by happens, stance or by chance. This is something that we have to take initiative on and make provisions for so that we can continue to partake of God's word. That's Also notice that growth is something that is essential for all Christians. When we think about growth, we might think of young children, babies and small children who are growing and then adolescence. And then at certain point, physically you stop growing, you're not going to get any taller, you may, your waist size may grow, but that you're not your stature is not going to increase. But for the Christian spiritual growth is something that should happen throughout our lifetimes. It's not just the new convert, or the young person that needs to grow. But this is something for elders and deacons, preachers and teachers, moms and dads, grandparents, spiritual growth is a journey that we go on throughout our lives. So we don't ever get to a point where we say, Okay, I've, I've hit the limit here in terms of my understanding, spiritual growth will continue to happen. And I want to just show you an example of someone who thought they had arrived at the end and Matthew chapter 26. Matthew chapter 26. In this is, when Jesus is telling his disciples about what is about to happen to him what he's going to go through Matthew 26, and verse 31. It says, Then Jesus said to them, all of you will be made to stumble because of me this night, for it is written, I will strike the shepherd and the sheep of the flock will be scattered. But after I've been raised, I will go before you to Galilee, Peter answered and said to him, even if all are made to stumble because of you, I will never be made to stumble. Now you can you can hear the confidence in his voice, he's almost saying, Lord, I'm, I'm capable, I'm strong enough to handle this. And almost like a, like a teenager that gets behind the wheel and says, I know what I'm doing. Or I can handle this, or, you know, I've got this. And Jesus just looks back at him, and just says, You're not ready, yet, you still have a ways to go. And Jesus understood what it was going to take to get Peter to the point where he would be ready to stand for the Lord. And so he says to him in verse 34, a surely I say to you that this night before the rooster crows, you will deny me three times. And then Peter goes on to affirm again, even if I have to die with you all, and not deny you, but think about Peter being able to stand up on the day of Pentecost, in front of all those people, both the believers as well as the critics of Jesus, and to deliver the gospel message. The church is just starting, and Peter is able to do that. And then he takes the gospel to the Gentiles, he goes, and he meets Cornelius, and he's the one that opens the door to those people, and how he becomes such an instrumental parts of the kingdom of God's work at the beginning of the church. And yet here, we just see a point in his life where he thought he was further along than he really was. So I think the lesson for us is just to remember that we're not as strong as we may think we are, when we're dealing with temptation, or we put ourselves into a relationship or another situation where we think I can handle this, this is going to be okay. We may need to step back and say, you know, where am I truly at? Is it my as far along as I might think I am, and just be humble about that and continue to try to, to grow and mature in our faith.

Conrad Harkrider  09:05
So another verse that I wanted to look at in regards to thinking about growth for everyone is John chapter 15. And verse one, it says, I am the true vine, this is Jesus speaking. And my Father is the vinedresser every branch in Me that does not bear fruit he takes away and every branch that he that does bear fruit, he prunes, that it may bear more fruit. Already you are clean, because of the word that I have spoken to you abide in Me and I in you, as the branch cannot bear fruit by itself unless it unless it abides in the vine, neither can you unless you abide in me. So Jesus really divides this into two groups here. He says in verse two, that there are the branches that bear fruit, and then the ones that do not bear fruit. And it's interesting that Jesus and the Father actually make provisions for those who are bearing fruit and growing, he says that they're proved that the vinedresser actually comes in and enables them or helps them to be able to grow even more. But the ones who are not growing or progressing, they're they're cut off, they're taken away. And then notice in verse four, he says that you cannot bear fruit by yourself, that's so important for us to remember that, that growth and progress happen in Christ, we have to be connected to Jesus, in order for us to truly mature and grow up in the Lord. So growth is something that is for every Christian, and it's something that's essential for us as we think about our relationship to the Lord. So I want to spend the rest of our time talking about how we grow, right, if we agree that spiritual growth is important, and that it's a necessary part of our walk, then how do we do that? And there is a verse in Ezra chapter seven, in verse 10, that I think out, outlines this really well if you want to turn there to the book of Ezra. If you're like me, you've got to save the books to get there because that's not a book we always turn to. So right after, after Chronicles. But Ezra chapter seven, in verse 10, look at what it says about this, this prophet of God. It says, For Ezra had prepared his heart to seek the law of the Lord, and to do it, and to teach statutes and ordinances in Israel.

Conrad Harkrider  11:51
That's the three point sermon right there, he had prepared his heart, to seek the law of the Lord and to do it, and then to teach statutes and ordinances. So first of all, we see that he had prepared his heart to seek the law of the Lord. Some translations say that he was studying the law, which I think is appropriate. It means that he was the idea is diligently inquiring, he was questioning he was asking, he was searching the Word of God. And that is a foundational point for our growth. It is the bedrock of our faith that we would be invested in God's law in God's Word. In Romans chapter 10, and verse 17. It says that faith comes by here. So then faith comes from hearing and hearing through the word of Christ. We can't develop a faith without God's word without the words of Christ, that's where it has to, has to start. So this is a bedrock or a foundation for our faith. When you think about the Bible, and our connection to it, instead of just seeing it as a book of rules and regulations, we should really look at scripture more as the these are the letters, these are the words that our father has left us. And if we want to learn about our Father, if we want to know about Him, if we want to develop a sense of his, who he is and what his character is like then then we have to start here. There was a story in the news recently about this girl in believe she was from Tennessee, but her father had passed away when she was 16 years old. And he had made provisions he had had a cancer of some kind. And so he was he was sick for a while. But he had made arrangements for flowers to be delivered to her every year on her birthday. And when she turned 1718, she would get this bouquet with a card from that her dad had written. And on her 21st birthday, he sent a letter to her, it was longer than just the cards the cards would say, I love you, or I care about you or whatnot. And then the honor 21st birthday, the last year that he was going to send something he sent a full letter. Now I want you to think about if your father had passed away, and you got a letter from him, what would you do with that? Would you just read it once and then put it in the drawer? No, you'd be reading that thing over and over, you probably show your friends you'd show your family members. This young lady posted it on Instagram. And so that's how ABC News and everybody else picked it up, but it was all over the place. And the point is when we view this as communication from our father, it changes the way we see it, we want to read it, and learn it and study it and know it so that we can know about him. So we can develop that, that connection, that relationship to him. In Second Timothy chapter two, and verse 15, Paul says, do your best to present yourself to God as one approved a worker who has no need to be ashamed, rightly handling the word of truth. When we're wanting to work and serve in God's kingdom, we don't want to be ashamed or overstepping our place. We have to develop our senses to be able to rightly handle God's word. And that comes through through studying. And I'll say that, you know, we get a lot of great Bible instruction, when we're here together. I think the the teachers in the back do a tremendous job, the people who teach in the auditorium who present lessons, there's some great insights and information that's given from God's word when we're together, but just a couple of hours a week is not enough. It's not. That's a small portion of the diet. But we need to be regularly ongoing, consuming and partaking of God's word to build up that strength so that we can do what what Paul talks about here, being able to rightly divide the Word of Truth.

Conrad Harkrider  16:38
In recent years, I've really haven't done much cooking. Thankfully, I watch a lot of cooking, being done, but I don't actually I'm not actually the one behind the skillet there. But when I was in college, I did put my hand out at a few recipes and make some attempts. And I'll tell you that there are certain recipes that you cannot get by with just adding the grip the ingredients at will, right you if you double the garlic powder, it's not tasting good. Okay, so what do you have to do with that recipe? You don't have it memorized by heart. I mean, you may have made the dish a few times, but you still have to go back, you're you're referring back to what it says. And in the same way the Bible serves as as kind of a guide for us. As we start to encounter different areas of life or different situations or circumstances, we constantly go back to God's word, it helps us to keep us on track, keep us on the path, so that we're not getting misguided or, or we start to stray off into into something else we can stay following the path that God has set before us. Also think about the Bible as being a map or a guide for us. You know, now that we have our smartphones, we're kind of spoiled with. We don't even think twice about where we're going, we just get in the car, I have no idea I'm about to drive 10 hours, and I don't know where I'm going and just listen to the phone Take me there. But you see, you have to you have to get out the map, you have to plan out your course, you have to follow the different markers along the map and in the same way the Bible serves is that roadmap for our life, it gives us that direction, you know, where where should I be? What should my focus be, at this point in my life? When I get into that relationship, that marriage? What is that supposed to look like? How am I supposed to be treating that person? You know, as a father, what, what should be my primary focus? Or? Or what should I be putting emphasis on? You know, how should I be interacting with my family? The Bible helps to serve as that that guide and that direction. In Deuteronomy, chapter six, and verse six. It says, in these words that I command you today shall be on your heart, you shall teach them diligently to your children, and shall talk of them when you sit in your house. And when you walk by the way, and when you lie down, and when you rise. Now notice when the word these words that he had given to them, where were they supposed to be on their heart inside of them? And then when were they supposed to be teaching them to their children? What times of the day, he pretty much covers every aspect. You are talking about them when you sitting in your house when you're walking by the way when you're lying down when you're rising up. I mean, he gives a few actual places but the point is all the time everywhere at all points. This should be something that is constantly on our minds where we're teaching our kids and for us today that would be you know, when you're waiting in line when you're driving in the car when you're sitting down for Dinner. There are so many opportunities for us where we have downtime where we'd be talking about God's word talking about the world, teaching our children doesn't have to just be something that's formal at a set time of the day. It can be something that is more organic that we do along the way.

Conrad Harkrider  20:18
So putting emphasis on the word of God seeing it as more than just a book of suggestions, and rules. Psalm chapter 19, and verse eight, it says, The precepts of the Lord are right, rejoicing the heart, that commandment of the Lord is pure, and lightning, the eyes the fear of the Lord is clean and during forever, the rules of the Lord are true and righteous all together, More to be desired are they than gold, even much fine gold, sweeter also than honey and the drippings of the hood of the honeycomb. Moreover, by them, your servant is Ward and in keeping them, there is great reward. And notice all the things all the ways that he describes God's word, it's, it rejoices the heart, it's pure, it enlightens your the eyes, it's clean, it's righteous, it's better than gold, the most valuable asset that you could own in this life. And he says, God's word is, should be valued above that. And so as Ezra did we seek the law of the Lord for these reasons, because it can provide so much value to us because it is such a precious asset and and gift that God has given to us. Well, once the foundation of knowledge has been said that we have sought after God's Word, to seek to understand it. Then Ezra chapter seven and verse 10, says that the next thing would be to do it. He says that, in spiritual growth cannot and will not occur if we don't apply the things that we read in the Word of God. It may seem like a simple point to say, well, he read God's word, and then he did it. But that's so critical for us. How often do we hear things about having a humble attitude or being content or being generous or thinking about our brothers and sisters, and we hear those things, but then the actual practice of carrying them out is is a lot harder. It's way more challenging. In James chapter one, in verse 22, James says, Be doers of the word and not hearers only deceiving yourselves, for if anyone is a hearer of the word and not a doer. He's like a man who looks intently at his natural face in the mirror, for he looks at himself and goes away and at once he forgets what he was like. But the one who looks into the perfect law, the law of liberty, and perseveres, being no here, who forgets but a doer who acts, he will be blessed in his doing. And I want you to notice what he says in verse 20, to be doers of the word and not hearers only deceiving yourselves, how do we deceive ourselves when we just hear the word, but we don't actually act upon it. And I think one possibility, or one thing that he might be saying here is that religion and service to God is more than just listening and hearing and taking in these positive messages. It's something that has to be applied. And if we're not doing those things, that we deceive ourselves, if it's not having an impact, and it's not making a change in my life. Then, as he says, Here, it's like, the man who goes in, he looks into the mirror, and he sees something smudged on his face, and he thinks, oh, I should clean that off. And then he walks away, he doesn't clean it off. He just goes the rest of the day with something on his chin. James says, when you look and you see that reflection of yourself that should cause us to act. And take notice. Also in Luke chapter six, and verse 47, everyone who comes to me and hears my words and does them, I will show you what he is like. He is like a man building a house who dug deep and laid the foundation on the rock. And when a flood arose, and the stream broke against that house, he could and could not shake it because it had because it had been well built. Luke 647 through 49.

Conrad Harkrider  24:42
When we're building a house, how many of us we think about building our life we want the wise man's house, right? We want the house that is solid, it's firm, it's not going to move and when there's storms that come in life, whether that's some type of financial setback or a physical illness. Or if it's some type of tragedy or loss, we want the house that is stable, that doesn't just wash away. And notice what he says that, notice what he says where that comes from everyone who comes to me and hears my words, and does them, the doer of his words, that's the one who has this house built on the solid foundation. When it comes to driving your car and filling it up with gas, I've found that there's really two different kinds of people. There's the person who, when they see the gauge, barely tick below halfway there at the gas station, back up to full, they go and fill it up. And then there's the person that waits until the gauge gets down to the end, and then they wait for the light to turn on. And then they calculate that there's 2.7 gallons of gas. So I've got about 25 miles, and some of the cars do that for you today. And then it's like they're rolling into the gas station, the fumes, they're running on fumes, they're in neutral, and they just make it down the hill pull in to fill up the car. Now that may seem like kind of a silly illustration, but when the indicator when that warning light comes on, spiritually from the Lord, what what's our reaction? When there is something in God's word that pops out and says, caution? Do we put on the brakes? Do we slow down? Do we take notice that these things are given to us for for our benefit, so that when we are traveling down the road, and we do come across God's Word that it will help guide us in the right way? Or is it something that we just we kind of put to the side we what we wash it away and try not to pay attention to it? In Romans chapter two, and verse 21. It says, you then who teach others? Do you not teach yourself while you preach against stealing? Do you steal? You say that you must not commit adultery? Do you commit adultery? You are poor idols? Do you rob temples, you boast in the dishonor in the law, dishonor God by breaking the law. For as it is written, the name of God is blasphemed among the Gentiles, because of you. And Paul's point is, is that as God's people as Christians, it's, it can be easy for us to affirm all of these things, you know, people should not be stealing and committing adultery and lying and, and doing all these things that God forbids. And yet we can find ourselves doing the exact same things. And what a shame that verse 24, would be said about us that God's name is blasphemed among the Gentiles. Right? Maybe that's in regards to generosity or caring about other people, or whatever it may be. But does the world put us to shame when it comes to what God has asked us to do. So it's important for us to look at our own lives and make sure that as Ezra was doing, he had prepared his heart to seek the law and to do it. And then finally, the last step from Ezra 710 is to teach others, it says to teach statutes and ordinances. Now notice, these first two steps are critical to get to this third one, if you haven't sought the law and done it yourself, then your teaching is not going to be very effective. Those first two have to come in order. But this is the final step in the process. And in Hebrews chapter five and verse 11.

Conrad Harkrider  29:08
It says about this, we have much to say, and it is hard to explain since you have become dull of hearing. For though by this time you ought to be teachers, you need someone to teach you again the basic principles of the oracles of God. You need milk and not solid food for everyone who lives on milk is unskilled in the word of righteousness and see as a child, but solid food is for the mature for those who have their powers of discernment trained by constant practice to distinguish good from evil. You see the spiritual growth that's happening here, that we would move from milk to solid food, that we would train our senses and be able to discern good from evil. And he says that you ought to be the ones who are teaching by this point, and yet you need someone to come and teach you so Teaching others that's a that's a part of the progression for the Christian. It's not just for elders and preachers and Bible class teachers, this is something that all Christians would be able to get to the point where they would be able to instruct another in God's ways that happens in various avenues. We'll look at an example here in just a second. Look at a well it's here on the screen Acts chapter 18. And verse 24. This is a Paulus who goes and he's he's standing up and preaching it says, now a Jew named Paul is a native of Alexandria came to Ephesus. He was an eloquent man competent in the Scriptures. He had been instructed in the way of the Lord and being fervent in spirit, he spoke and taught accurately the things concerning Jesus. Though he knew only the baptism of John, he began to speak boldly in the synagogue. And when Priscilla and Aquila heard him, they took him aside and explained to him the way of God more accurately. Now, who are the teachers in this passage? Is that the one like a Paulus, who is standing up and, and teaching and preaching in front of people? Or is it Aquila and Priscilla, who see this happening and they take him aside and explain to him the way of God more accurately? You see, teaching happens in lots of different settings. But the point is that each of these individuals were using their gifts and abilities to be able to minister and serve in this capacity in in instructing others. So we're will have teachers that can stand up and speak and then we might have some, like Priscilla and Aquila that work more behind the scenes. Another example, when you think about the Christian teaching, look at Luke chapter eight. Luke chapter eight, and this is the the man who is demon possessed. After he has been healed, he wants to stay with Jesus. And look what Jesus tells him. And in Luke chapter eight and verse 39, he says, return to your own house, and tell what great things God has done for you. And he went his way and proclaimed throughout the whole city. What great things Jesus had done for him. Can you do that? Can you tell the people in your life, what great things that God has done for you. Don't Don't put so much pressure on yourself about being able to teach the Word of God. But just think about it more in terms of telling other people what God has done for you how God has changed your life. And we start to have that those conversations with extended family members, with grandchildren with nieces and nephews, but telling people what God has done. For me, the influence and the impact on the kingdom, if if we're all doing that is tremendous. It kind of goes back to Deuteronomy, chapter six, about how, if you're a parent, you're a teacher. If you're a grandparent, then you're probably a teacher. If you're an aunt or an uncle, I've had some great teachers that were in that position. But look around and see the opportunities that are in your life to be able to help administer in this way. And then, finally, Psalm 40 And verse eight, I want to conclude with this verse. And we think about growing spiritually, all ultimately we want to get to the point where we can. This is the type of attitude that we have. He says, I delight to do your will, oh my god, your law is within my heart. I have told the glad news of deliverance in the great congregation Behold, I

Conrad Harkrider  34:07
have not restrained my lips. As you know, Lord, I have not hidden your deliverance within my heart I have spoken of your faithfulness and your salvation. I have not concealed your steadfast love and your faithfulness from the great congregation. When we seek the law of the Lord, when we do it, then this it becomes our delight. It just flows out of us. We start to tell others about God's deliverance and his steadfast love and what he's done for us. And then, ultimately others will see God's glory through us. Well, where are you tonight? All of us are in one of two positions. We are either growing and maturing spiritually or we are declining, we are starting to wither and Maybe it's helpful to think about where I was three years ago or five years ago and my more excited and enthusiastic about serving God today than I was five years ago. Or do when I look back on the years of my life do I think to myself, you know, I was I was probably more energized than and so maybe this is a an opportunity as we start a new year 2018 For us to recommit or rededicate ourselves to the Lord. Well, I hope those things have been helpful to you. We're going to extend an invitation as we close tonight, if there's something that we can do to encourage you and your walk with Christ, if you need to make a confession or ask for prayers. If we can help in any way please come down to the front as we stand and sing
