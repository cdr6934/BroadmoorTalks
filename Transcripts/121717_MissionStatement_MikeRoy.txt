It's always such a privilege and an honor to come before God to worship Him to praise Him, to remind ourselves of ourselves of His greatness is in our continued dependence upon him. And so it's a, it always thrills my soul as we come together and worship together. And remember what Jesus has done for us to then focus on His Word as we seek to become more and more like our Savior. Thank you, Carl, for the songs that you lead this morning, it'll hopefully tie in with some things that want to talk with you about this morning. Over the last couple of years at Broadmoor, we've had themes for the congregation, I guess, about two years ago, it was be a brighter, light, great idea. And not just to let your light shine but be a brighter light make a difference in the world. I think those things are so powerful. This past year has been the idea of Kingdom citizens that we are citizens of God's kingdom, we submit our will, to the will of God to His rule. And I think this helps us to be intentional in our living as we have a theme that we can be thinking about on a regular basis. But this morning, I want to ask you a question. Have you ever thought of developing a personal mission statement for yourself? And I want you to think about that. With me this morning. In some ways that could be similar to a congregational theme. But this is very personal. For you personally, for me, personally, what is your mission? And what can you think about on a daily basis, those things are very powerful in a lot of ways. And so I want you to think about that this morning. And I'm going to be talking about the idea of developing a mission statement for 2018. And it may be different for every one of us, most likely it will be you might have multiple mission statements. But I want us to think about that. Because understanding that we are, we are created by God to be mission minded people were created with a purpose to glorify Him to raise children, if we're in a marriage situation to glorify God, He made us so that we can be a light in a dark world that we can attract others to God's kingdom. And I want to suggest to us this morning, as we think about this challenge of developing a mission statement for your own personal life, that's what I'm talking about. But by doing that, you might save somebody's soul from hell. You might save your own soul. So this is part of the character, the fiber of how we have been made. God made us with a mission mentality. And you see it in the sports field, people get out there, they train, they exercise, they do all the stuff, they can be the best athlete possible. We do it academically we strive to, to learn a particular field and excel in that. And so I just want us to think about that. This morning. As this year is coming to a close about the possibility I'm saying write this down, don't just think about it, write this down, put it in your in your notebook, put it on your iPad, or your tablet, or wherever you use, about the idea of developing a mission statement. For this new year, it makes a difference. It makes a difference in how you live, it makes you live with greatest sense of purpose. It helps you to focus on the things that God wants us to be doing in our lives. And so I want us to think about that. This morning, as we see one year coming nearly too close. And we're on the verge of a new year. So the first question I want to raise is this question. Does the Bible show us examples of men and women who live with a strong sense of mission? While you think about Moses, you think about Abraham, you think about Peter, you think about Paul, it surely does. At every turn of the page, we see people who have a strong sense of mission. And so when he asked that question, does the Bible show us men and women who had these mission statements? Maybe it wasn't called that but that's what they had. It surely is true very quickly. Here are some mission statements from the Apostle Paul. He said, I'm not ashamed of the gospel, Romans chapter one. Same couple of verses. I'm a debtor, to all men to preach the gospel. For me to live is Christ and to die is gain. That's a mission.

Mike Roy  04:42
You said I'm pressing toward the goal to win the prize of the upward column in Christ Jesus. Then it says in Philippians, chapter four, I've learned the secret of being content. So here's just a few samples. We'll actually look at a couple of those and some others as well. But I want to suggest very clearly in Scripture, we see men and women, godly men and women who live their lives with a clear sense of mission and purpose. And this is just one example. So let's put together seven examples. And it could be a lot more to talk about, but seven is the complete number in the Bible, perfect number. So hopefully this will be a perfect sermon. Or far from that. But I have a perfect source to preach from. But let's talk about that. The first one I want us to think about is Philippians, chapter four. I'll have the scriptures up on the screen. I'll be reading from the ESV. And Paul talks in this context over here about his contentment. Now he's in prison. I remind my mother this all the time, she faces her challenges. And we all do. Paul's writing from prison, nada, the Hyatt Hotel in downtown Birmingham, Atlanta. And this is what he said, I rejoiced in the Lord greatly that now at length you have revived your concern for me, you are indeed concerned for me, but you had no opportunity. Not that I'm speaking of being in need, for I have learned in whatever situation I am to be content, I know how to be brought low, and I know how to abound. In any and every circumstance, I have learned the secret of facing plenty and hunger, abundance and need, I can do all things through Him who strengthens me, it was kind of you to share my my trouble or my affliction. The numeric and Standard Version says. So you know, as Paul talks about learning the secret of facing plenty and hunger, and facing abundance and need, but he makes that statement. I have learned in whatever situation I am to be content, not gonna ask you to raise your hand this morning. But how many of us would say that could say that? Could this be a mission statement for you in 2018? I thought about saying and suggesting I'm going to be content every day of my life in 2018. That's just almost too hard to do that. So I suggest I am. I am. My suggestion is I am learning to be content in every situation, if you get a lot of money in the bank, or if you don't have much at all, if you get great health or if your health is failing. So there's so many issues to be thinking about. And so it's a challenge for us to, to possibly consider that for yourself. I'm gonna give several. And you might want to write these all down for your mission for 2018. Because obviously, we need to be putting into practice these biblical principles. But Can Can you do that? Could you say that Paul's in prison, I have learned in whatever circumstance I find myself, I am content. That's hard. That's a hard thing to say and to do. And again, realizing where Paul's writing from. But with that effect, if you wrote that down, you started your day, January 1 2018. I am determined I am learning that I will learn to be content this day. And every day we that affects your outlook, your attitude, your perspective on life. Would that help us with the comparison game? My house is not like brother so and so's My house is not like the neighbor down the street. We just finished up a job ahead of work yesterday. For a house down in Brentwood and governor's club. You could fit three of my houses in his house. But would that help with this comparison game? I think it would. Would it help us overcome our struggle with a materialistic mindset? We just can't seem to keep up with the neighbors, the friends, whoever it may be. And it was amazing to think about the Apostle Paul considered his thought that Paul, the apostle Paul was truly content with nothing. You know, you can get to heaven with nothing, no money in the bank. You can meet me face some challenges. But Paul was content having nothing, whether he was well fed or if he was facing hunger, and great adversity. Paul was content with what God had given him. So that's the question, Are you content? Will you be content? Are you willing to learn to be content? It's a tall task that we have to work on every day. I still remember years ago, Shannon's down in Jamaica with several other young people. David Tennant was down two years ago visited the Christian lady of someone who would have had obeyed the gospel at some point. Live in a little

Mike Roy  09:30
shack, literally, literally a little shack, maybe a straw roof, and we don't do those kinds of roofs with with my company but a straw roof and she had a sign on her wall. That said is Philippians 419 and my God will supply all my needs in Jesus Christ. Wow. He or she is living in poverty. She said My God is going to take care of me I'm content to live in this little bitty shack on the small poverty island of Jamaica. So, it's a challenge for 2018. If you had that mission statement with that change how you live your life. Let's look at another possible mission statement that we could develop. And this is in reference to Enoch, a man who walked with God that says in Genesis, chapter five, verse 21, that Enoch lived 65 years and became the father of Methuselah. Then Enoch walked with God, 300 years after he became the father of Methuselah, and he had other sons and daughters. So all the days of Enoch were 365 years, Enoch walked with God, and he was not for God took him. So again, what a challenging mission stay What about in 2018, you wake up on January 1, and you say, I'm going to walk with God every day? Would that change how you live your life, your confidence, your optimism, your hope, your zeal, your excitement, how you love your wife, your children, teaching your neighbors and friends? Surely it would even walk with God in a time when people were not doing that. And he's stuck out in his culture? And so how do you do that? How do we walk with God everyday? Well, obviously, it's very, I think, very plainly, we pray to God everyday use that blessing of prayer. And then also we listen to God every day. So prayer, is God listening to us? listening or reading His word and meditating on his word, is God speaking to us, we need to listen to God. And that's what I think characterize Enix life. Did you notice the text over here, so Enoch walked with God, I can do that. I'm not going to be perfect, I'm gonna fall short. But I can do that. And setting that as a mission statement. Again, wake up in the morning and say, I'm gonna walk with God today that will help you in your trials help us in our temptations that we face. But did you notice what the text says that Enoch walked with God and he was not for God took him? Why? Why did God take him? The text isn't saved. But I think after walking with God every day for 300 years, I think God may have said something like Enoch, you know, you're actually closer to my home than yours. Why don't you just come home with me, and God took him, he didn't die. Wow. You think if we walk with God, every day, we'd be more concerned about heaven and the earth. But we live in a culture where it's hard to keep our focus on spiritual thing. So that's, again, a challenge to set this as a mission state statement, I'm going to walk with God everyday inducted Noah did, again, they were living in a culture where people were not walking with God. So let's look at a few others. From Romans, chapter one, verses 16 and 17. Paul says, I'm not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power of God for salvation to everyone who believes, to the Jew first and also to the Greek. For in it the righteousness of God is revealed from faith to faith, as it is written, The righteous shall live by faith. Look at verse 16. Paul says, For I'm not ashamed of the gospel, was this a mission statement for Paul? I think it was, I don't think it's called a mission statement, any version, but this was his life's mission. He said, I'm not afraid. I'm not afraid of who I am. As a Christian, I am not embarrassed to be a Christian. I'm not ashamed of the gospel. He lived his life every day like that. And so we need to maybe challenge ourselves with that type of

Mike Roy  13:48
have a mission and a focus statement in our lives. And I think too often, even as Christians, were somewhat embarrassed about our faith, and maybe especially the narrowness of God's word and the narrowness of Jesus teaching. And so we're afraid to maybe speak up and speak out, as we should let our light shine. And again, when you look at the apostle Paul, that this was part of his core belief. He said, I'm not ashamed of the gospel. It is narrow. You can't get to heaven any other way, except through the blood of Christ. And that may offend a lot of people on this earth. But Paul says, I'm not ashamed of that. That's the only way to get to heaven. And he was unafraid to speak. That that message, we sometimes sing that song, I'm not ashamed to own my Lord nor to defend his cause. Let's live by that song. Let's look at some other mission statements about Abraham. And Hebrews chapter 11, verses eight through 10. It says, By faith Abraham when he was called, obeyed by going out to a place which he was, which he was To receive foreign inheritance, and he went out not knowing where he was going. By faith, he lived as an alien in the land of promise, as in a foreign land, dwelling in tents with Isaac and Jacob, fellow heirs of the same promise. Look at verse 10. For he was looking for the city, which has foundations whose architect and builder is God, this is an American Standard Version. So Abraham had a mission statement, he woke up every day with this, and said, I'm looking for the City of God, I'm marching towards that heavenly city, we sometimes sing that song I'm marching towards, to Zion. So this Abraham was a man think about this way back, leaving early counties, when God calls him from that place. He was a man looking for the City of God, a city built designed by God himself, and Texas, it when he was called to go to the promised land, he obeyed God. It said that he went out not knowing where he was going, how do you convince your wife or your nephew and a whole entourage of people that he had with him? That you guys all follow me? I'm taking you to this place that God told me Oh, where are you going? Abraham? Well, I'm not really sure. But God's gonna lead the way. How did Abraham do that? Abraham led his family out of Earth, the counties by faith, the same way that we would do that today? Did you notice in this text also that Abraham and Sarah, and later on, I think with Isaac, and Jacob, and all those with him, they lived his life, in tents in a tent, that did not bother Abraham. Did that bother Sarah, that she lived her whole life? Apparently, in a tent? It's fun to do that for a weekend, and not for the whole your whole life? And why didn't that bother Abraham and Sarah, because they were on their way to a city that was built by God himself with the streets and made of pure gold? Have you ever walked in a neighborhood with the streets are made of gold? No, I don't think you have.

Mike Roy  17:11
But in heaven, that's what it's made of a pure of as glorious. It's beyond our wildest imagination. It's a city where the tree of life is blooming every day. And there's no night there's no death, there's no more morning, and there are no tents in heaven. It's a permanent place, like we talked about in our class this morning, with Ruth and Naomi wants to provide her a permanent place of safety in this relationship. And again, so I'm saying that Abraham was on a mission. He wasn't just thinking about Canaan, he was thinking about heaven. So the question is, are we like minded? Are we going to have the same mission minded focus that that Abraham had, I think it'd be well to do that if we woke up every morning. And we say to ourselves, I'm looking today for the City of God, I want to go to heaven, more than anything else, certainly make a difference in our lives. Let's look at a few other mission statements in Matthew chapter five and briggen kind of focus on verse 13. Jesus said, You are the salt of the earth. But if salt has lost its taste, how shall its saltiness be restored? It is no longer good for anything except to be thrown out and trampled under people's feet. Verse 14, was our theme for last year. But this again, I'm thinking in terms of a personal mission statement, Jesus said that you are the salt of the earth. And I want you to think about that. If you woke up every morning with that and said, that statement, I am the salt of the earth, how would that change how we live our lives? It's one thing, especially in terms of a congregational theme, if we say, we are the salt of the earth, which is true, but in a sense, that kind of relieves me of any personal responsibility. Well, I said, if I'm not really being as salty as I should, brother Byers, or John or Dave, or somebody else is going to be, you know, make a difference in the world around us. But the statement Jesus is wanting us to think about is I am the salt of the earth. That's me. That's my example. And, again, the implication we'll be talking about this mode wheeling in our class on Wednesday, from the Sermon on the Mount, but the world is corrupt. This is governed by sin and darkness and blackness and evil in all types of moral corruption. And whose job is it this to stem the tide of evil, Jesus said, It is my job, your job, I can hope that maybe as a church collectively, you can make a big difference in this area. But he's not really just talking about that. He's somewhat personal responsibility. And so we do that by Are example by speaking up and speaking out. I remember years ago, Curtis took a bunch of us to a predators game in Nashville. And you know, when you go to a hockey game or football game, the people they are not always the nicest people around, they're flooded with drinking, getting drunk or are drunk, obnoxious, all that type of thing. And you hear all these things behind you. And, and I don't remember what this guy was saying. But it was, it was offensive. And I remember Jeremy sweets got up and talked to this guy and said, Excuse me, sir, you know, your speech offends me or my family. I don't remember exactly what he said. But he was being the salt. I don't think the guy was cursing after that. But that's what God calls on us to do. And I remember when I obeyed the gospel many years ago, and the guy who taught me the gospel out in California was in the Navy, and people would come into the barracks or like the dorm, and they've used God's name in faint and vain and he would say, What did God ever do to you? Why are you using his name like that? And I used to find myself saying the same thing as I get older. I may not say it like I should. But that's what salt does. Salt stems the tide of evil, it curbs evil. So what if you woke up, and that's your mission, I am the salt of the earth.

Mike Roy  21:18
It's not brother, so and so sister, so So I am the salt of the earth. And if I'm not acting as salt, we'll talk about that Wednesday night. It says I'm good for nothing. Salt, that salt when it loosens its saltiness. So again, some challenging thing for us to think about. Let's look at a few other mission statements that we can develop personally in our lives. Romans chapter one, in verses 14 and 15, Paul says, look into language, he said, I am under obligation both to Greeks and to barbarians, both to the wise and to the foolish. So I am eager to preach the gospel to you also who are in Rome, the contemporary English version, put it this way. And this one, I'm going to going to give the suggestion of the a mission statement. So that doesn't matter if people are civilized and educated, or if they are uncivilized and uneducated. I must tell the good news to everyone. Was this Paul's mission statement? Sure was. I don't think he maybe wrote it out like that. But this, so this was Paul's mindset. I don't care if they got a Harvard degree. Or if they dropped out of elementary school. If they get lost in money, or they're destitute, he said, I must tell the good news to everybody. Judgment Day is coming, brethren. And we need to remind ourselves of that, it may be by speaking up and being a brighter light and acting as a kingdom citizen, that we might not convert somebody, but look at the consequences of the chance that you might save somebody from eternity in hell. So Paul was driven every day of his life with a mindset I must tell others about the good, I must tell the good news to everyone. And again, it's a it's a reminder for us to think about that as a mission statement. And I want you to think about this analogy. So if if people are dying with different illnesses and you have the you have the the the antidote, you have the anti venom, you get the cure for a medical illness, and your neighbor is dying. With a deadly disease. You have the you have the the cure. Is it okay not to go and tell him? I've got some medicine for your friend, please take this. What would you think if we didn't give the medicine to him or offer it to him? That's not very nice, not very thoughtful. That's terrible. If we have medicine, our neighbors dying, all you got to do is given the medicine. So the same thing is true. We're dealing with with sin, which is the deadly disease. And we have the remedy for sin, brethren, is faith in Jesus Christ. It's obedience to the gospel of Jesus Christ. And so, again, having a mission statement helps us when we say You know what, I have to tell the good news, they may not like it. They might may not like me, that doesn't matter. Paul says in first Corinthians chapter four, verse three, when a verse that I've been thinking about, Paul said, but it makes little difference to me what other people think about me or even if I'm before a court, that I don't even judge myself, God judges me. He said, I care very little. I care very little about what people think about me in terms of, they're evaluating me by my salvation. My justification comes from God. And so again, as a reminder, this was His mission. This was his personal mission statement. I must tell the good news to everybody. Let's look at it If mother, maybe one more example this morning, and flipping is chapter one, verses 21 through 24, there's so many that we can talk about. But again, we're focusing our idea on developing a personal mission statement in your life. And it may involve several missions. But Philippians chapter one, verse 21, through 24, Paul said this, For to me to live as Christ, and to die is gain. If I am to live in the flesh, that means fruitful labor for me, yet, which I shall choose, I cannot tell, I am hard pressed between the two. Then he says this, my desire is to depart and be with Christ, I want to go home, I want to go home, he said, for that is far better. But to remain in the flesh is more necessary on your account. Could that be your mission statement and mission and you wake up in the morning and you say, I'm ready to leave this world I want to go to be with my father in heaven. Let me think about this, and you think about this with me? What if God said to everyone, anyone here, you can go to heaven today? Tell your wife, your children, goodbye.

Mike Roy  26:21
Tell your friends. You're gonna gonna leave? If God said you can go to heaven today? Would you take it? Or do you walk away? Say no, I'm not not says too many things I've got to do. I know what Paul would say. I'm ready to go. But it's maybe better for me to stay and teach the gospel. That's what I'm gonna do. But think about that. If God gave you that offer, the truth is God doesn't work that way. He doesn't give us that offer. That he doesn't tell us when we're going to die. Because he wants us to be ready every day, to be thinking about the home that he's preparing for us. This glorious beyond all comparison. But he wants us to have a burning, passionate hunger in our heart a longing as Paul says in the book of Romans that are groaning. Sometimes you groan for heaven. And we will talk about in Matthew chapter five hungering and thirsting after righteousness. So this was Paul, excuse me. Again, this was Paul's mission statement, My desire is to depart and be with Christ, could you write that down in index card for the new year, a daily mission, I want to go, I want to execute. I want to, I'm ready to leave, I want I want to go to be home with my father in heaven. And so these are just a few to think about. But they're very practical. And so as we wrap up the lesson this morning, the question that I leave with you is this question what will be your mission statement for 2018. You could say, Excuse me, I am learning to be content in every situation. That's a tall task. I'm going to walk with God every day. I am not ashamed of the gospel, I am looking for the City of God. I am the salt of the earth, I must tell the good news to everyone. And I want to leave this world to be with Christ. Those are powerful mission statements. And so as we think about our lives, and making a difference in the world that we live in developing this type of mission statement can make a big difference in our life we can see in Scripture certainly made a big difference in Abraham's life. And in all these characters, Jacob and Isaac and David and Daniel, Nepal and Peter and all of them. We need to be be thinking about that because it'll certainly make a difference in how we live our lives. It may be that you're here this morning and you're not ready to go to be with God. Maybe heaven obeyed the gospel of Christ. What preaching is all about is lovingly sharing the good news that Jesus loves you he loves all of us. He suffered and died for your sins. What he wants from us is loving obedience. He wants us to God wants us to believe that Jesus is the Messiah. He wants us to be willing to, to repent of our sins, to confess our faith in Him. And He ordered us he charged us to be baptized, immersed in water to have your sins forgiven. If you do that you can be part of God's family have the HOPE of eternal glory. But if you say no to God, there's not another chance you may not get another chance. So if you're you know that you need to obey the gospel. Take advantage of this opportunity. It may be that you just need to praise the Congregation for strength in facing your life on a daily basis. If there's anything that we can help you with. You need the President's congregation we invite you to come while we stand and sing this invitation song
