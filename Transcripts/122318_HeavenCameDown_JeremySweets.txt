Good morning. Certainly good to see everyone here today. It's a little bit rainy, cloudy outside. But it's a beautiful day, isn't it? It's a beautiful day because we can come here and worship our God, we can reflect upon him, and what he has done for us, we can partake of the Lord's Supper and remember the sacrifice of our Lord Jesus Christ. We do have many visitors here this morning. We're glad you're with us. You're our honored guest. We gather on a weekly basis. And we do that to give glory and honor to God, our Father, and we're glad that you're here with us as we worship are gone. In 1987, in October of 1987 18 month old Jessica McClure fell into a well, and many people from the town of Midland, Texas where that happened descended upon that well, in fact, there were rescue workers that came from many other places as well. And after 56 hours of drilling, when the outcome seems uncertain, in many ways, over two days, they drilled they were finally able to bring baby Jessica up from that well, and that scene played out on national television. Many people remember that I was nine years old, but I still remember watching some of that on on the television. And so that baby was brought up that baby was rescued from the well. Well, in a similar fashion and John chapter one, we see that Jesus Christ descended, in order to rescue us, I say similar, I mean, similar in the fact that there was a descent and a rescue. Certainly the scope is not similar. Baby Jessica was one baby in need that was rescued. And we're certainly thankful for that. But Jesus Christ came in order to save the world. John, one is a tremendously foundational passage, you might say, really, I don't want to overstate the case. But I don't think I am when I say the foundational text of Scripture. It establishes so many fundamental truths for us to look at and consider. John writes on a very elementary basis as far as a reading level, but the truths that he portrays are profound and deep. And I believe we can see that as we look at John one, verses one through 18. There we see the prologue of John, and we're going to be talking this moment, this morning about the fact that Heaven came down, Heaven came down. I'll be covering most of this passage. But let me begin by reading the first three verses. In the beginning was the Word and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with, with God, all things were made through Him and without Him was not anything made. That was May. One commentator made this point Jay J. Ramsay Michaels, and his commentary that all of the Gospels begin with a beginning. They have that concept where a looked at Matthew chapter one, I believe that was a week or two ago. And there we see the book of the genealogy of Jesus Christ. And that reminds us of Genesis. And so we go back to the beginning of his genealogy, as it looks at Jesus as the son of Abraham and the son of David. And it traces that from Genesis, in the book of Mark, it states, this, the beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ. And so it is the beginning of that message of good news begins with John the Baptist as he announces and prepares the way for Jesus Christ. And it begins after that to talk about Jesus and His ministry.

Jeremy Sweets  04:07
The Book of Luke, Luke, wanted to make an orderly account, and he makes mention there and in Luke verses one and two, it talks about the events that were accomplished among us, just as those who from the beginning were eyewitnesses. And there he has referenced to the beginning of the gospel of Jesus Christ seeing his ministry in what he did that which was accomplished. But notice here in John, that the beginning stretches even further back as far as you could possibly go. The first words of Genesis are in the beginning God, God created God was there God was not a created being but in the beginning God was there and he created the heavens and the earth He created all things. God is eternal. He was before the beginning of time that God created for us. And so we look here in John chapter one. And we're reminded of that text in the beginning, in the beginning was the Word. And so when we first talked about heaven came down, John establishes this idea of heaven, and he begins in heaven. And he talks first of all of the word, in the beginning was the Word. The Greek word for word, is Lagace. And that's the word that John uses here. And then the original language that had reference to more than just letters that compose a word like we might think of, but it carried the idea of communication or a reason, a concept that was behind this truth. It was used in the settling of accounts, or the reasoning that was given the logic behind you might even see that English word that derived from Loggos. Lagace was an important Greek word in Greek philosophy as well. Eric Cletus use the term to describe the universal law or principle than inherently ordered the cosmos and regulated the phenomena. And that's a quote from a dictionary. The Universal Law, there's this principle, this Lagace, that originates all things. And John takes that even a step further. That's not just a principle, he begins to talk about the word, the Lagace, what is truly behind the beginning of all things, but it's more than a principle, as we'll see, as we move along. So he talks about the word and he says that in the beginning was the word just as we saw in Genesis chapter one and verse one, in the beginning, God, God was there God existed from the beginning, from all time so it is true of the word. In the beginning was the Word, the Word was there, the word is not a created being, the word is not temporal, the word did not come into existence. But rather the word was in the beginning, the word is eternal, the word is pre existent, if you can even use that word or that concept. Before time began, before God created, our mechanisms of time and all things, the word was there. Not only that, but we see that the word was distinct. Notice in John, these first three phrases are so packed full of teaching and truth. We see here that the word Jesus Christ, as we'll be, as we'll discover later, was in the beginning, he was eternal. And if something was in the beginning, it was either with God as we see, from Genesis one verse one God was there was either with God or it was God. Notice that John's gonna say, the word is both. In the beginning was the Word and the Word was with God. The word was a distinct here being, it was one that existed with God. But he goes on to say, not only was he with God, but he was God. It's hard to wrap our minds around the very nature of Jesus Christ, but we see in this text, that He is eternal, is distinct in some way, but yet he is the same. He is God. In the beginning was the Word. And the Word was with God. And the Word was God. John begins by talking about heaven, and the one that was in heaven. But not only that, we see in verse three says, In all things were made through Him and without Him was not anything made that was made. Jesus Christ was the creator of all things. He was not relegated to a part of creation, where a God the Father created all things. And Jesus had a little bit to do with creation in this corner of the world. He wasn't assigned some galaxy far away, but rather Jesus Christ created all things. There's nothing that you can talk about that exists apart from what Jesus Christ did. He created all things and He is the Creator. And so we see that heaven is what is under discussion.

Jeremy Sweets  09:43
But John goes on to say that heaven came down. Heaven came down. We can see this mentioned in verses nine through 11. It uses this language of coming or coming down in verse nine. It says this word was light This light was coming into the world. And verse 10, it says he was in the world, and the world was made through him. And again in verse 11, He came to His own. We often see God as separate. We know that He is holy and distinct, but God, that whole God came down, that Holy God came to earth, that Holy God came and dwelt among us. And that's exactly what we see in verse 14, which this last part of the prologue in verses one through 18 provides really a summary of what we've already stated. We've already seen that the word came down. But notice how it states it in verse 14, it says, And the Word became flesh, the Word became flesh, it was embody it put on flesh. Notice that the Lagace, as we mentioned before, was a term in Greek philosophy that was this principle, this some kind of force behind all creation. But here John says, No, the word took on flesh. The word was not just some principle, but a being that stepped into our world, and took on flesh, he was not just some kind of principle, or moving fours, know the Lagace, which was eternal, preexistent, God took on flesh. You could meditate on that statement, for hours, and days, and weeks and years, and never fully come to grips with what God has done. It's a profound statement, and certainly, any words I could offer with would not really even scratched the surface of the depth of meaning of what God has done, God, embodied flesh took on flesh became flesh. One Greek philosophy called Gnosticism believe that all things that were spiritual, were good. And all things that were physical, were bad, or evil. And this statement, the fact that the word heaven came down and took on flesh would have been repulsive and repugnant to them. To think that that which is spiritual could take on flesh now, because spiritual, they said, was good, and they couldn't take on flesh. But John says, No, the Word became flesh. And so he denies this concept of good spiritual and just because it is physical, it is evil. Now the word became flesh. And so Greeks would have been offended by the statement we see in First Corinthians chapter one and verse 18, as they sought after their wisdom, the cross would have been a stumbling block. And so we see that again, in the fact of who Jesus was. The Gentiles, we're not the only ones that would have been offended. For it says in verse 14, and the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us, and dwelt among us, the Jews would have found that second part of that phrase, that dwelling among us as something that reminded them of the tabernacle, the word means to dwell or take up residence or to pitch a tent or take up a dwelling, there have been the word that was used to refer in the Septuagint, to the tabernacle, that tips that was there. And so this would have immediately reminded the Jews of the Tabernacle of God, the presence of God. And here it says that God took on flesh and he tabernacle. Now you remember God's presence was manifest, or shone through the tabernacle, God was with his people, and he led his people on a pillar of fire in a cloud, we see that that pillar and that clouds surrounded the tabernacle when it was made. And it was the very glory of God, the presence of God that inhabited that tabernacle. So God's presence would be found in that tabernacle. And we also see that it was later found in the temple as well as God's presence filled the glory of the Lord filled the temple.

Jeremy Sweets  14:39
Now, here, John tells us that God's presence would be found in the man, Jesus Christ, the one that took on flesh, the glory of God, the presence of God, as it was shown in that pillar cloud that, that pillar of fire in that cloud In the tabernacle in the temple is now found and shown fully in Jesus Christ. God would dwell among his people. In Matthew chapter one and verse 23. It refers to math. First to Jesus, there is a manual, or God with us, Jesus Christ. tabernacled he was the presence of God among the people. He tabernacled dwelled among his people. Philippians two verses five through seven describes it this way, you have this mind among yourselves which is yours in Christ Jesus, who, though he was in the form of God did not count equality with God as a thing to be grasped, but emptied himself by taking the form of a servant, being born in the likeness of men. Heaven came down. Jesus Christ took on flesh became flesh, and we are so thankful that he did. John tells us this fundamental truth. So when that happened, what was the consequence of that? Or what did heaven brain? Well, John tells us many things that heaven brought, when it came down, first of all, glory. And John one and verse 14, says in the Word became flesh, and dwelt or tabernacled among us, and we have seen his glory. Notice, first of all, that flesh did not diminish the Savior. The Savior was not less, because he took on flesh. And this makes that point clear because they saw his glory, the glory of God, in Jesus Christ, he was not diminished in any way. But we also were reminded, again, as I mentioned, the tabernacle that was filled with the presence or the glory of God. Notice what it says in Exodus 14, verse 35, says the night Moses was not able to enter the 10th meeting, because the clouds settled on it and the glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle. Notice that the glory of the Lord is it filled the tabernacle, and it makes mention that Moses was not able to enter into it, he was not able to go because of the glory of the Lord, and how Great and Majestic it was, in Leviticus 26, a passage we looked at in our Bible class this morning that talked about the covenant there in verses 11 and 12. God says to his people, I will make my dwelling among you, and my soul shall not a poor you, and I will not walk among you and will be your God, and you shall be my people. And that was on condition of them following after the covenant, following after the commandments of the covenant. But God said, even there that I will dwell among you, and I will walk among you. We also see that the glory filled the temple. In First Chronicles seven in verses one and two, reminiscent of what happened with Moses. It says, As soon as Solomon finished his prayer, fire came down from heaven and consume the burn offering and sacrifices, and the glory of the Lord fill the temple. And the priests could not enter the house of the Lord because the glory of the Lord filled the Lord's house. Here we see that it says about the word that when the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us, We beheld or saw his glory. And that would make sense doesn't it? Glory has always been associated with God. Glory has always been seen in God. We also see that glory is an important concept in the book of John, that word glory appears 15 times and if you add, glorify or some form of that it occurs even more glory was displayed when Jesus performed the miracles. Notice in John chapter two and verse 11, when Jesus turned the water to one, this the first of his signs Jesus did at Cana in Galilee, and manifested His glory. When Jesus used the very power of God, to manipulate change,

Jeremy Sweets  19:30
that which is physical, he displayed glory, He manifested His glory. In John 11 and verse four, when Lazarus died, Jesus says this, or he said, this illness does not lead to death. It is for the glory of God so that the Son of God may be glorified through it. And we see again as we travel through the miracles of John, it was not only the changing of a substance that was the glory of God But here we take a step further into the this idea of the resurrection of life, displaying the glory of God. It was more than manipulating physical things, but rather it was bringing life to death, or from death. And so we see the glory of God display. The glory of God was displayed even in what the world despised in suffering, and pain and death, especially in suffering, pain, and death. In John 17, is Jesus prepared to leave to go to his father, he says, Father, the hour has come, glorify Your Son, that the Son may glorify You. He says in verses four and five, I glorified You on earth, having accomplished the work that you gave me to do. And now Father, glorify Me in your own presence, with the glory that I had with you before the world existence. You know, we talk about God in terms that that are really inadequate. Sometimes we use the word awesome. And that's very appropriate as we think about God, God is awesome, all inspiring, really, when you think about God, and being awesome, causes you really not to use that word with much of anything else. Only God truly is awesome. And we see His glory, and his lord was seen in the sun. And so we see that heaven brought the very glory of God, when it came. Not only that, but it brought the revelation of the Father and verse 18. No one has ever seen God, the only God who has at the father's side, he has made him known. Jesus Christ revealed, the father made Him known fully in a way that had not been revealed before the fullness and the depth as seen in Jesus Christ was greater than anything that appeared before. When Moses approach God on Mount Sinai, he made this request in Exodus 34. He said, please show me your glory. And God said, I will make all my goodness pass before you and proclaim before you my name the Lord, and I will be gracious to whom I will be gracious and will show mercy on whom I will show mercy. But he said, You cannot see my face for an A and shall not see me and live. Notice that Moses wants to see the glory of God, that glory came in a greater extent in Jesus Christ. But he goes on to say, and God goes on to tell him, you cannot see my face. You cannot be hold me. In Jesus Christ, He revealed, he made the father known. He could say that I and the Father are one as you look upon me, you look upon the father, yes, Jesus Christ refute revealed the character, the nature, the as Exodus 33 says, the goodness of God, unlike any other. Hebrews one three describes Jesus this way. He is the radiance of the glory of God and the exact imprint of his nature. And he upholds the universe by the Word of His power. Jesus Christ reveals the Father. He is the exact imprint. No, I think about a finger print, a fingerprint that is left as a mark, and they can use that fingerprint to identify the one that it came from. It is an exact match. And so we see of Jesus Christ that He is the exact match. The radiance of His glory, is the exact representation. Jesus came. And when he came, he revealed the father and what a glorious thing that is.

Jeremy Sweets  24:24
Jesus also brought life and light. And verse four, we see that it says there In him was life, and the life was the light of men. You know, we were already reminded from John one and verse one in the beginning. You'll remember what God did in the beginning. In the beginning, God said, Let there be light and there was light. You'll notice that that commandment came before the sun existed. God was the source of light God was the power behind light. And even when the sun came into existence, God was still the source of the power. But lest there be any confusion, God said, Let there be light, and there was light. Notice what he spoke, he spoke the word, and he used words, and he spoke to light into existence. God also brought life. He brought life to play, it's a brought life to the animals, and he brought life to human beings. In Genesis two and verse seven, it says, He breathed into the nostrils of Adam, the breath of life. God is the source of all life. And so we see that God is life, and God is light. As we grow through John, we see that light is an important concept. And it's not only what we see with our physical eyes, but it carries the idea of also what we come to understand. Light is something that is equated with true, the words of truth. And so as we see, in John, we see that this idea of being enlightened with the gospel message, being enlightened with the truth, now many people were blinded to that truth or turned a blind eye, we might say, to that truth. But notice that when Jesus Christ came, he brought light, he brought what was good, he taught what was needed, he presented a message of salvation. And that message was light. And it was life, life for those that were dying in their sins. When Heaven came down, life and liked, were brought. Not only that, but we see in verse 14, that there was grace and truth. The end of verse 14, it says, We have seen his glory, glory as of the only Son from the Father full of grace, and truth. In verses 16 and 17. It says, For from his fullness, we have all received grace upon grace, For the Law was given through Moses, grace and truth came through Jesus Christ. When Jesus Christ came, we saw that there was a notice how it uses that word, fullness, there was a full measure of grace and truth. It's not that grace and truth had never existed. But you see, to a greater degree to a greater extent, the fullness of this grace and truth. Notice what it says in verse 17. For the Law was given through Moses, grace and truth came through Jesus Christ, the law of Moses. Now the law of Moses. Again, the contrast is not saying that the law of Moses was devoid of grace and truth, and all of a sudden with Jesus Christ that appeared. Now the law was of great benefit to the Jews. It was a message of grace and truth, it brought for those people, the very mind of God, the character of God was displayed in the law. And so the people could see grace and truth in the law. But notice that the law of Moses was limited.

Jeremy Sweets  28:22
It was limited in scope. It was the covenant law for the Jewish people. It was not given to the Gentiles. And so it was limited to a group of people. But we already saw in John one, that the word came for all for all the world. And so the law of Moses was limited, but Jesus Christ would not be grace and truth would be fuller. And in its fullness, it was also limited in what it could accomplish. The law could identify sin and say, this is sin. This is a transgression against the Holy God, but it could not fully rectify the problem, or provide forgiveness of sin. But that would occur, that would be accomplished in Jesus Christ. And so the contrast is more of a greater degree, a greater extension that is found in Jesus Christ, grace and truth came through Jesus Christ, and praise God that it did. Heaven brought so much for us. These are just a few of the things that John mentions in this prologue. So how was heaven received? Well, how should have haven't been received? Haven't should have been received with a red carpet. No, if an earthly royal king came that throw a parade they'd have some You know, a big to do a big show a big welcome, welcome. Come here, see what we have to offer. That's what should have happened in a, you know, an even greater degree. For God, the King of all kings, the Lord of all lords who came to this earth, he should have been received with open arms, he should have been welcomed like none other. But notice that he was rejected. By and large, most people rejected Him, and they rejected him despite a number of things that that would lead us in the other direction that would lead us to say he should have been welcome. Notice, first of all, that he was rejected, despite having a witness, in verses six through eight. There it says there was a man sent from God whose name was John. He came as a witness to bear witness about the light that all might believe through him. He was not the light, but came to bear witness about the light, John prepared the way he announced, the Savior is coming. There is one greater than I am not here, but there is one greater, but yet the word was rejected. The word was also rejected. I used the word good intentions, but but God was seeking the good, or the benefit of those that he came to see in verse nine, says the true light, which gives light to everyone was coming into the world. This light, this truth was for the benefit of humanity, it was for their good. But despite that, it was rejected. It was rejected. We also see that this was coming from the very Creator of the universe, one of the oddest statements, I don't know if that's the right word to use. But in verse 10, it will make you scratch your head. He was in the world, and the world was made through him. Yet the world did not know Him. Jesus Christ was the creator of all things, not a segment, not a part, but of all things. Jesus Christ, the creator came into the very world that he had made, that he had designed with power and with law. And the world did not know Him. The creature did not know the Creator, and they rejected him. What a shame. That is. Not only that, but it says that He came to His own in verse 11. And his own people did not receive Him, we see that his own family, his own physical family did not fully grasp and understand who he was. And many of them rejected him in some sense. But I think this has reference even to the Jewish nation, his own people, those that were told beforehand, not just by the witness, John, but through the law, hundreds of years before, prepared the way for the Messiah, and Jesus Christ came to His own people.

Jeremy Sweets  33:18
And his own people rejected him. I don't mean to make light here, but even a mass murderer, his mother will accept. They will love that boy love that son. They say, I hate that he did this. But the own people of Jesus Christ rejected him. And so this rejection is shocking. It's shocking. Maybe it's shocking until we see our lives and those around us and how we have reacted to God, how we have resisted God in many ways. Well, when Heaven came down, by and large, there was rejection, but the gospel doesn't end there. In fact, we see in verses 12, through 13, heavens hope, I will mention that some people say verses 11 through 13, really is a microcosm or a short picture of all of the Gospel of John, this rejection is seen in Chapters one through 12. But in chapters 13 through the end 21, we see that there is a message to the remnant those that would accept Jesus Christ. And so we see that the hope is that people would accept the Savior. That's why Jesus Christ came in verses 12 and 13. It says, but to all who did receive Him who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God, who were born not of blood, nor of the will of the flesh, nor of the will of man, but of God. You know, the text says that his own people, the Jewish people largely rejected Jesus Since, remember that Jesus Christ came to preach a message not to one nation, he started there. But that was not the limited extent that he had always intended, he came to preach a message to all people. And it was not those that were born by flesh into the Jewish nation that would be saved, but rather it was those that were born again, born anew, as we see in John chapter three, those that had a nother births, another birth, those would become and have the right to become the very children of God. What a great thought that is, in the covenant language of the Old Testament, God would say that, that I will be your God and you will be My people, and what a comfort it is to be, to belong, to have home, to know a place where you belong, and God says that can be found in me. And we can be the very children of God. Notice how it says that is to occur, those that believe in Me, Jesus Christ, those that would trust in Jesus Christ, those that would deny myself and give all to Jesus Christ, those that would depend wholly and totally upon Jesus Christ. There is an opportunity to be a child of God. This message from John is still just as profound, just as true. And just as needed. Today, we can behold

Jeremy Sweets  36:46
Jesus Christ, coming down to the earth, not with our physical eyes. But as we read through the Scriptures, and the Gospel accounts, what has been recorded for us, we can see Jesus Christ come to your and we can also see the glory of God again, not with our physical eyes, like they did. But through the eyes of faith as we read what he did and understand the very power that he had. Yes, this message calls upon us to join those people that either reject or accept. The option is laid out for us today as well. Well, we stand in awe of our great God who sent Jesus Christ down to the earth for us, will we behold His glory? And as it says in verse 12, believe in Him, accept him receive him, or will we reject Him, despite all that he has done for us. In the song Heaven came down, the chorus says this, Heaven came down and glory filled my soul. When at the cross, the Savior made me whole. My sins were washed away, and my night was turned today, Heaven came down and glory filled my soul. That opportunity, that invitation comes from God today as well. You can believe that Jesus is the Christ, repent of your sins and turn away from a lifestyle of selfishness and sin and turn to a life of devotion and in service to God. confessing that Jesus is the Christ, being baptized in the water for the forgiveness of your sins so that you can be born again, born anew, so that you can commit your life fully and totally to him. If you've done that, you've begun your walk. And remember, you've committed your entire life. So if you're a Christian and not living as you should, you also need to make amends, the Gospel invitation stands open and available for any that would come. If you're able and willing, please come as we stand and sing at this time.
