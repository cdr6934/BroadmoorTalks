me evening right evening you will please open your Bibles to Matthew the second chapter Matthew Chapter Two lifeforce look at this passage tonight. Very wonderful passage in many ways. I'm trapped to this for a couple of reasons tonight one a couple weeks ago or so Jeremy spoke on Matthew chapter one. And he had agreed to work our way through the New Testament going one chapter at a time. So I thought the Romans would do that tonight. No, I was appreciated his study, I thought we might continue that in some ways, Matthew, Matthew chapter two, but also in our high school class. We were we're looking at Herod on Wednesday night and and within Matthew chapter two, we have one of the most infamous accounts concerning here. So So I thought we would use Matthew Chapter Two as the basis of our study, I think it's gonna be helpful to us. So if we begin by reading the chapter is a fairly lengthy reading. So please follow along in your Bibles as Irene and we will then discuss the text. After Jesus was born in Bethlehem with Judy, and the days of Herod the king, the whole wise man came from the east to Jerusalem, saying, Where is he who has been born king of the Jews? For we saw his star when it rose and have come to worship him? When Herod the king heard this, he was troubled, and all Jerusalem with him. assembling all the chief priests and scribes of the people, inquire to them where the Christ was to be born. They told him in Bethlehem of Judea, for so it is written by the prophet, and you will Bethlehem in the land of Judah are by no means least among the rulers of Judah. For from you shall come a ruler who will shepherd my people Israel, then heard some of the wise when secretly and ascertained from them what time the star had appeared. He said them to Bethlehem saying, Go and search diligently for the child and when you have found him bring me word that I have two may come and worship him. After listening to the king, they went on their way and behold a star that they have seen when it rose winter for them until it came to rest or over the place where the child was. And when they saw the star, they rejoiced exceedingly with great joy. And going into the house, they saw the child with his with marry his mother. And they fell down and worshipped him. Then opening their treasures, they offered him gifts, gold, and frankincense and myrrh. And being warned in a dream not to return to Herod. They did a part to their own country by another way. That when they had to part of behold, an angel, Lord appeared to Joseph in a dream and said, Rise, take the child and his mother and flee to Egypt. And remain there until I tell you for Herod is about to search for the child to destroy him. And he rose and took the child and his mother and his mother by night and departed to Egypt and remained there until the death of Herod. This was to fulfill what was the Lord is spoken by the prophet. Out of Egypt, I called my son inherited when he saw that he had been tricked by the wise men became furious. He sent and killed all the male children in Bethlehem, and in all their region who were two years old, or under, according to the time that he had ascertained from the wise man then was fulfilled what was spoken by the prophet Jeremiah, a voice was heard and Rama, weeping aloud limitation, Rachel weeping for children, she refused to be comforted, because they were no more.

Curtis Byers  06:31
When Herod died, behold, an angel Lord appeared in a dream to Joseph in Egypt. Same rise, take the child and his mother and go to the land of Israel, for those who sought the child's life, or dead, and He rose and took the child and his mother and went into the land of Israel. But when he had heard that Archelaus was raining over Judea in place of his father, Herod, he was afraid to go there. And being warned in a dream, he withdrew to the district of Galilee. And he went and lived in a city called Nazareth. So that what was spoken by the profits might be might be fulfilled, that he would be called a nazzer. When you look at any passage of Scripture, I think, you know, our obviously, our objective is to learn the major point, what is the lesson that God is trying to tell us? I think though, to get to that point, we first have to look at some of the details is sometimes easy for us, or maybe simpler, we think, to simply look for the main point and not worry about the details and go on our merry way. And then oftentimes can be properly maybe properly done. I do think that on many occasions, sometimes we need to look at the details. First, before we understand the big picture, we have to understand the little pictures. And maybe if we then come to a bigger picture, we will have the correct picture if we can make sure it's consistent with all that we have seen. So I suggest as we approach our Sunday night that we do that very thing that we've kind of started looking at some of the details, and then at the end of the lesson, we'll try to draw some major lessons that we can from this passage. The first thing I like to do when looking at a passage is to see if there's anything within the text that gives a clue as to how it is arranged. And as I was reading this text effect, I went back and looked at the latter part of chapter one, because chapter one and chapter two do form a unit. I definitely noticed that, you know, several paths, three passages started with a word now and now as a kind of a way to transition from one part to another. So I was curious if that was in the original or just in the translation or so forth. And using tools, but it wasn't exactly as I expected. There is a there is a phrase. Now behold, that's used on four different occasions to introduce a new thought throughout this section. It's not, it doesn't correspond with our English versions very well. But nonetheless, it gives us some structure. If you look back at chapter one and verse 20. The English Andrus is against this, but as he considered these things, behold, well, that's this phrase. Now behold, and then if you go to chapter two and verse one, you see a repeat it and repeat itself and 13 and 19. So if you take those indicators, I'm gonna be looking at Chapter Two though, Nichols indicators This suggests that maybe this chapter should be divided into three parts, as indicated by those. Now, as I look at the text that seems to be pretty good in several ways, because the text clearly also mentions with regard to Joseph, Mary and Jesus that he was in three different locations. He was born there in Bethlehem. But due to the circumstances, they fled Egypt, and later they came back to Nazareth. And those movements from one place to another coincides with the structure that seems that the author was using. In there are other characters in the story as they used to once you start looking at the characters who started noticing them. The wise men are clearly a major, or major characters in the story. And they too are doing a lot of traveling as from Joseph and Mary and Jesus are traveling throughout this narrative. So have the wise man they come from the east. I don't know exactly where that is. Perhaps, Babylon. Wise Man is a generic term, it can mean a lot of different things. It can mean anything from a magician to a sorcerer, or to even a teacher. It had a very broad range of meanings. And

Curtis Byers  10:59
astrology is another possible term and because they are going to be following a star, or many would think that these are astrologers. And astrology was very important in the eastern part of the of the world of this time, particularly, it's a Babylon, and Persian. So these wise men are coming from the east, they come to Jerusalem, and they come there to worship the King that they have foreseen through the star, and they're gonna then go to Bethlehem because of what they learn in Jerusalem, and then they're gonna go back home. So that all occurs fairly early within the chapter. We're also introduced to Herot. And then later, his son Herot is the king of the Jews. He is the king of Judea and all the surrounding territories have basically what we would call Palestine. He was a client of Rome, and he was under their control, but they had allowed him to rule there as king. And about this point in time, he had been ruling for about 30 years, he was a very able administrator. He was an excellent and builder, probably the greatest builder of the ancient worlds. One historian says that he was the richest man of the era. And that would even include the Caesars. He was the richest man of the era. But he's also very ruthless. And we see that ruthlessness within his story. He had 10 wives, his favorite wife, he strangled. She apparently, she thought she did something that he thought was against him. He learned later that she wasn't guilty of what he thought she was. He was kind of sorry that he had killed her. He had three supposed to have his favorite songs, he killed them to our third son all because he thought they may be a threat to him and a throne. He was he was easily move, to bring harm to another if he felt was in his best interests. So it's not this story. And what we read of hair in this account is not unbelievable, at all. In fact, it's quite believable, that when he thought that there was a king of the Jews who might challenge him one day for his throne. It's not surprising that therefore he would take action against that child and try to destroy him if possible. He dies. Not much longer after this apparently, he was succeeded by his son arc Elena's. That's kind of the region up there the the grew large green area is the territory that arc Ullaeus was given control of. After Herod died on Harris death, Rome divided the territory up into three major portions. And each of those portions a different son of Herod was given control of so Arca Laos was given control of the larger area, Judea and Samaria. Herod Antipas was given control of the area of above that up in Galilee, as well as this region over here in Paris Perea and then another son Philip was given an area up there even further north more than Syria. So the land was divided between those three songs and Arklay has had a major share in our class. It wasn't quite it wasn't near the administrator, or ruler that his father was. And so within a very short period of time relatively, he was deposed by Rome. His rule was taken away from him because he was incompetent. And this is when the proxy raters were given control over Judea. And so we know of a pilot we know of Felix and Festus who were Roman procurators, who were governors of that territory was art glass with the Pope. was.

Curtis Byers  15:06
But there are other characters within the story two or three occasions we read of angels if you go back to latter part of chapter one or a fourth occasion where an angel is mentioned. And each of these occasions an angel brings warning, and two, first or two occasions to Joseph. And also on another occasion to the wise man, the purpose of the warning was for them to be careful and to change their plans, so they could avoid the wrath of Herod. The other major character, I'll call it a character is the star of the show. And that brings attention to the to the wise man, the fact that another king, the true King of Israel, has been born the King of the Jews. So let's start. Let's start there, let's start talking about the wise man first focus upon what they saw, at the time that they became became interested in into intrusion. We're told that the star appeared in the east, that'd be a literal translation, English standard in most modern translations, usually an equivalent phrase as rising or an equity rose. Now, that is a very technical term or term for a particular moment in the life of a star along this path. Now, of course, if the Earth did not rotate, the stars would appear to be fixed, they would, would appear never to move. But because of the rotation of the Earth, the stars take a path. And they do the same path year after year after year. And there is a period of time during the year that they're visible to us. But then there's a period of time where they're not visible when the other side of the sun and the brightness of the sun shields them. But there is that point in time. They say that if you look into the east, and just right before the sun rises, that you can see stars at the rising. And that would be that wouldn't happen year after year after year, the same points for the same stars. So we were told that they saw a star at his rising and that was apparently for P for strong numbers, that's a very important point in time of the life of a star appears dark. So it'd be something they would be looking for. US we'd know what know for sure. You know, we know that they saw the star. And I have often assumed that the star guided them to Jerusalem. But the text really doesn't say that. When they saw the star at his rising, they apparently understood that there was going to be a king of the Jews that was going to be born. And so the text simply says they went to Jerusalem, whether the star led them to true Islam or not, it doesn't say. But it does say that once they were in Jerusalem, and they were looking for Jesus. They were when they were told by Herod, that he would be in Bethlehem there Herod didn't know that you might think that here and lived among the Jews for 30 years, and he would have picked up on a few things. But he had not picked up on the fact that there was going to be a keen forewarned in Bethlehem, the Jewish people knew that. But as they begin to lose their travel to Bethlehem, the text does saying that the star went before them. And then as stood over the place where the child was. So this star apparently had the ability to give directions, the normally a star you will see come up in the east, and it would travel to the west. When they're in Jerusalem, they're going to be traveling south down to Bethlehem. And so that star is going to direct them to the South was not a path of a normal star. So that kind of gives rise to the question and you know, what was the star that they saw? Well, it could have been a star. But nobody thinks is a star. Because there's nothing dramatic about a star. A star does the same thing. Every year his path is predictable. There's there's nothing that would give attention to one star versus another star. And so it doesn't would not go along a path that would be that compatible could be but not necessarily that compatible with the text. So nobody really thinks it was a star.

Curtis Byers  19:42
It could be a meteor, but probably non meteors are short lived. I mean they have their brightness because they enter into the Earth's atmosphere and they quickly disintegrate. So certainly not long enough to allow time for the Weizmann to travel from the east all the way to Jerusalem. So not immediate were mining mining means somebody suggested a conjunction of planets, there was a strong drummer David Hughes, I believe his name a few years back, he came to the conclusion that there was a conjunction of planets that they saw. As his Herod died, we believe the best estimate we haven't missed death is in the springtime of four BC, we'd be looking for something that occurred within one two or three years before that. And it was a conjunction of planets, three planets, I don't remember which three, there were three planet conjunction was pretty unique. That occurred in seven BC and he thought that was what they saw. Well, that's the conjunction to planets. Now, the bottom one there is that's the moon the other two, if you can see those small dots, those are planets, the one on the top is Mercury and the one on on below that is Venus. Venus looks brighter because it'd be closer to Earth or mercury is. So that would be a conjunction, no construction of planets are relatively rare. They, you know, they'd happen but not every day. And they are in astronomical terms, and certainly an astrological terms there are significant, they are pretenders of some event. So it may be a conjunction, particularly as a triple conjunction. Now, I had a hard time finding the triple conjunction photograph. But if you can see that, that's to the left, there is Jupiter and Venus is the bright one there in the middle, and down below that is Mars. To me, that would just look like three stars. But again, if you're, if you're into the business, of looking at the sky and trying to discern things, triple conjunction to planets would be significant. And there was one that possibly could have been during the timeframe. Somebody suggested a nova or a supernova. NOVA is a star but as a dying star, and right before it dies before it burns out, it gets significantly brighter. And because of that, it becomes noticeable and becomes apparent and draws attention. And there was a supernova and there's one astronomer who says that he thinks there was a supernova, or at least a nova in five BC, and that would fit the timeframe. And so he thinks that's the star. And it will look something like that. Now this was taken with a with a camera. This is a nova that was taken with a camera. This is supernova Excuse me. There may have been a zoom lens, I'm not sure there may be some filters, I'm not sure. But you can get them since and it's something that you will see is definitely a very bright object in the sky. And it would draw attention. The problem is both the conjunction of planets and then over the supernovas, how, how do they give direction, particularly conjunction of planets, they occur for a period of time and quickly they separate from one another. A supernova is simply a star. And so the same limitations that have any star would have it to would have in terms of given directions. So some don't think of Nova or supernova as the best estimate. And they think perhaps a common is now been a couple of different suggestions. That's one astronomer thinks that that five BC event really wasn't a nova, he thinks it was a common instead. And then there's another actually a Bible scholar who kind of became an astronomer who's just recently wrote on this, he thinks there was a common in six BCE, again, these fall within the timeframes that won't be the veins of economy. When we think of an economy we normally think of something like that, right? So that just kind of traveling across the sky that has a tail. But commas oftentimes also take paths that look like this, where they're coming downward to the earth, and because of because of the way that their orbit is with respect to the Earth orbit. And if you're looking for something in the sky, that has the potential to point to a particular spot, because it says the text says that as they were traveling to Baphomet, to Bethlehem to the star, but before the Hilton stood over the place where the where the child was so calm, it actually could act like a pointer to a point on the earth, again, as viewed from a particular location. Right. If you're in a different location, it would act like it's pointing somewhere else.

Curtis Byers  24:41
If you don't like that, maybe it's just a miraculous star. Maybe it was just a special star that God made for this purpose. And that could be I mean, God can do anything. But I would have to ask the question, Why would God go to the trouble of providing a miraculous star when he could have simply told Have them where they go. There's angels galore in this in this passage. So the gold Lord, can it use an angel? In fact, something people think even an angel is what is being referred to here that what instead of a star, there's a Bible scholar Allison, who just recently wrote that he thinks is an angel. Now, he's motivated, because many of the early Christians in the second, third and fourth centuries when they were writing about this event, they thought it was an angel that was being referred to here in this text. And so he took that tack. I don't know. I applaud the effort, though. Because we take the text seriously, it means something, right? It means something. And for an astronomer, or for anybody to spend years studying this, and these men have, they obviously take the text very seriously, to try to discern what the text is saying. It many, many times people are rewarded for their efforts, when they take the text seriously, I'm not competent to say which of those could be. But if as a comment that's makes perfectly good sense. Clearly is still God's hand is involved, no matter how it was done, because of the timing of it, and so forth and so on. But then that raises the question, what did the wise men understand? What was it that they understood when they saw the star edits rising? Or when it rose? They came to Jerusalem, they said they were searching for the King of the Jews. Does that mean that they were searching for the Messiah? Or were they just simply were searching for a political ruler, like Herot. In fact, maybe why they were in Jerusalem is that they knew Herod was the heir. And maybe they were looking for some descendant of his who might be the future king, I don't know. The text doesn't say explicitly. Now, the next first does say that they came to worship him. The only dilemma there is that the word worship understand is a more general word. And it oftentimes only means to give homage to now there's a difference between worshiping and giving homage to wouldn't be agreeing to worship implies that the one you are worshiping is divine. To give homage to one another is simply to say that they are superior, that they have some sort of rule or standing above you. So some translations, translators, ami, some translations, translated as worship. If we ask that question, you know, you might say, how do the wise men gain that understanding? Wasn't through their astrological skills that they discerned it? Was a through some sort of divine revelation, an angel, or perhaps even somehow Old Testament passages perhaps could bring into light? I'm not sure. Or is it a combination? Of course, the textures doesn't tell us, right? The textures doesn't tell us that. And so I'm a little bit hesitant, and I'm going to resist the temptation of offering any opinions, because I really just don't know and text doesn't say. But it does tell us something right, it does tell us that this was a, in some sense, a universally proclaimed event. If wise men from the ease to come and understand that something spectacular was happening, they King of the Jews was born. And that's that's pretty significant, I think. And it's, it's inefficient for this story. Because you look at the Texas one more thing that's interesting about the text. And that is, each of the four major events within the text. There is a corresponding Old Testament scripture that is cited as saying to be fulfilled, in the things that were then taking place. I want to spend a few minutes looking at these prophecies and seeing what you know what it means, and particularly to be fulfilled, because I've included in this list the four within our chapter two, but also gone back because the same thing is said, concerning the virgin birth of Jesus at the latter part of chapter one. And so I've included that in the list as well. In all five of these instances, the text says, that the Lord has spoken to the prophet or prophet has spoke. And for the cases, it says that the things that took place was to fulfill what was said by the prophet

Curtis Byers  29:44
that were fulfilled as an important word is a word we often come across as we read the New Testament. And I'd like to just think about that for a minute because I think oftentimes, when we think of the word fulfill and particularly in terms of a prophecy like this, we think of some old testament statements, some Old Testament statement that a prophet made. And then we go to the New Testament, we find where that was, which was said was to take place, in fact, does take place. And so we say that this New Testament event fulfills the Old Testament event. So it's kind of like a like this arrow, there's a pointer that points from the Old Testament event, to the New Testament event. And if you look at Sam, look at the second prophecy, in this list, the one concerning Bethlehem. This seems make a lot of sense. The text says there in chapter five, latter part four, so it is written by the prophet, and you will Bethlehem and lander Judah are by no means least among the rulers of Judah. For from you shall come a ruler who will shepherd my people, Israel. Now, this text is clear. It specifies a place where this future ruler is going to come from. And that place is Bethlehem. And when we come to the New Testament, and we read Matthew Morin and Matthew two, we read that Jesus is in Bethlehem. And so it looks like we can say that the prediction that was made in the Old Testament has been fulfilled by this occurrence, New Testament, that that's fine, that works. But I'm gonna suggest that we maybe look at the word fail and a little bit different light. And to do that I want to point to is use in three different passages and New Testament, all with respect to the idea of fulfilling a ministry, enrollments 15, Paul talks about his ministry and that he has fulfilled his ministry, and Colossians four, and Paul is talking to Archippus and tells him to fulfill his ministry. And then a second Timothy, Paul is talking to Timothy and tells him to fulfill his ministry. Now this is the same word, right? It's the same word. And clearly the idea, the idea of prediction, has nothing to do with any of these passages. It's not as if these things were predicted and they are simply doing what was predicted that doesn't make any sense of these texts. The word fulfill simply means to feel full, to complete. So I would suggest that you look at these particular passages think of the ministry as a charge as a mission that they have been given. And as they go about doing the things within their ministry, they are gradually filling full their ministry to the point where they have done everything you can say that they fulfill their ministry think of a series of vessels or containers, say water whatever. And you can pour a little bit in is partially full, we can pour a little bit more and when you have totally filled it, it has fulfilled its purpose. Right? It is totally full you cannot put anything more in it. It is complete, right it is complete. Now if we go back and look at this prophecy, I'm going to suggest that we can look at this a little bit different way because the prophets look what exactly what the Prophet said. Oh, Bethlehem and Linda Judah yard No. Oh, she Oh, and you bet the Hammond lander Jude are by no means least among the rules are from from you shall come a ruler who will shepherd my people Israel. The ruler that is foreseen in this passage is a ruler over Israel has a rule over Israel. For what do we see when we come to Matthew two. He has called the King of the Jews but who is bowing down to worship him. Gentiles. He's wise men are Gentiles. And they have come from afar, Gentiles who are far off, they have come and they are bowing down before Jesus.

Curtis Byers  34:21
So the New Testament occurrence is even fuller. Right? What we learned from the New Testament event is broader, is bigger than what we were to learn from the Old Testament prophet. So although the Old Testament prophet kind of gives us a glimpse into what's going to happen, the New Testament gives us a fuller a more complete picture. So I would suggest that we look at this image as opposed to simply error. Think of something that is small that grows until it is full. And I'm going to add one more thing to that I put a little circle around that because even as we read The Old Testament we have a sense that there's something missing. Right? If you read the Old Testament from the beginning to the end, when you get to the end, you got to you said this is this can't be all, there's got to be more. The promises that you read of in the Old Testament certainly don't seem like they have been fulfilled in the Old Testament. So there is a sense when we read the Old Testament of something larger, it's just that we're not told until we get to the New Testament. And then we can see the fullness of the what was intended for us to understand. So I like that symbol. So let's just get rid of that first one and put that one in his place. A filling full think of that when you think of fulfillment of prophecy, a filling full. Now let's see how that works with other of these statements as well. He goes back to the latter part of chapter one, where it talks about Jesus being born of a virgin, the text says, All this took place to fulfill what the Lord has spoken by the prophet, Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and Barisan. And they shall call his name Immanuel, which means God with us. The passage of Isaiah seven is obviously an important passage or one that has been studied a lot. And in that passage, the context is, is that the Lord is going to give King Ahaz assign Ahaz was one of the kings there and Judah, and he was going to be given a sign. Because he was concerned about two photos of his to the north, Israel, Israel and Syria, they, they had collaborate, collaborated, and we're going to go against him, and he has was scared. But the Lord said, through through, Isaiah gave him a sign in the sign was this that a woman, a virgin or a young woman, either way, was to, was to conceive and bear a son. And before that son would get old enough to know the difference between good and evil, these two foes would be conquered, that they would be no more. So that was to give assurance to King Ahaz, that the Lord was going to protect him, was going to provide protection for him, and the child was going to be the son of that protection. If you're going to read in chapter eight, you read of a child being born and actually a child appears to be born to to Isaiah and his wife. text goes on. Now, as people have tried to make sense of that, oftentimes, and I have, I have used this language myself, that I kind of take this as a case of double fulfillment. In a sense, the prophecy was fulfilled and almost right away, right, because there was going to be a child and the child was going to be of a sign. So it had to be a child within the lifetime of Ahaz. And it'd be something pretty quick. And we read in chapter eight of a child that was born, who apparently is the sign of that was going to be given to a hands. But when we read Matthew, one week also clearly say that Isaiah was not talking about just the child there, chapter eight, he's also talking about the Jesus who was being born of a virgin. So we would call this maybe a case of double fulfillment, or dual fulfillment. It's kind of like the case over in Second Samuel seven, where the Lord gives a promise to David, and he talks about his son. Well, clearly, some of the things that the Lord is talking about has to do with Solomon. But it's also equally clear that the things he's talking about has to do with Jesus. And so we might will say that that is a case of a dual fulfillment as well.

Curtis Byers  39:00
But I've come to believe that that's not correct way of thinking about this. I will go back to my original idea, the original thought, and really what we're reading what what was fulfilled in the New Testament was not just the prophetic statement itself, it was the entire event that occurred in the Old Testament, the prophecy and the giving of the birth of a child in that day and time. That whole event is fulfilled by Jesus being born of a virgin in the New Testament period. And by being fulfilled, I mean this. The sign that the Lord gave Ahaz was important to Ahaz it was important to his own protection, safety. But the sign that the Lord gives to the world Being born of a virgin, His Son, Jesus being born of a virgin, is a much bigger and broader and more grand lesson and event than what occurred in the Old Testament. What occurred in the Old Testament was, was a was a glimpse of what actually occurred and God's plan. And God designed it. So that this new test with fulfillment It was a feeling full of what was hinted at, in the Old Testament. And I think we could go on and look at the other ones, too. The first 15 were when the angel warns Joseph, the text goes on to say this was to fulfill what the Lord has spoken by the prophet out of Egypt. I called my son as a prophecy from a statement from Hosea. Right before that statement of back in Hosea 11. The text simply says stuff like when Israel was young, I loved him. So Israel is the sun is being spoken off in Hosea 11. Israel as a as a was being personified as a single sun, and the point that the Lord is making that he loved his son, Israel. Now, Hosea 11, is in a context, much later than when they came out of Egypt isn't a context where the where the northern tribes have been unfaithful, and they're going to be carried away into captivity. And the Lord is kind of thinking back, and remembering how much love he showed toward his son, and bringing them out of Egypt. But they would no longer listen to him. They no longer would do what he asked them to do. And so they're gonna have to go into their own exile, even though they were in exile, in a sense, in Egypt, they're gonna have to go into an exile again, because they have refused to reciprocate the love. Well, how does this New Testament event feel for that Old Testament? Well, God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son. God loved his son, but He loved the world too. And He gave His Son to bring all people out of exile, exile of sin, He gave His Son as a redeemer, to bring them out. Just like he brought his people out of Egypt. So his son was going to be bringing people out of exiles. That's a bigger, that has a broader that has a more complete picture. And as you read the New Testament accounts, you see the fullness of what it was hinted at, in the Old Testament passage. Some would call this would be an example of a type antitype type of comparison, and I don't have any problem with that language. That's scriptural language, where this where there's Old Testament event, as serves as a type for a New Testament event. Well, that's exactly what I'm trying to convey by this language and filling full the type gives us a glimpse, the antitype gives us the feeling full so I don't know if we even need to use the language and type banter type. If we just simply think of the New Testament event, giving us a full or more complete picture of what was taking place.

Curtis Byers  43:48
Verse 17, after Herod said, to have the children in Bethlehem, killed, the text says verse 17, and then it was fulfilled when was spoken by the prophet Jeremiah, a voice was heard of Rama weeping allow limitation, Rachel weeping for children. She refused to be comforted, because they are no more. This is from Jeremiah chapter 31. Not chapter should ring a bell. So we've studied Jeremiah fairly recently. This is the only verse in Jeremiah 31 That is at all sad or sorrowful because the rest of chapter 31 talks about how the Lord has or will bring his people back from from exile from captivity. Rama was the place if you remember Rama was the place where the Nebuchadnezzar and his people gathered all the captains together, before they took them back to Babylon. So Walmart was the place Rama was in Benjamin. Rachel was the mother of Benjamin in the car On text of Jeremiah 31. This refers to the fact that before the restoration, there has to be the deportation. And so they're going to be deported. So there's gonna be weeping. But it's not the weeping, that I think that we are to focus on. And even though there were young children who were slaughtered, there in Bethlehem, this is coupled with a passage where he says out of Egypt, I'm going to, I'm going to call my son, there is a restoration, there is a calling from exile, there is a return. And the glories of the return are going to far exceed any momentary weeping that can occur. Because when God blesses, he blesses fully. So again, I think we ought to think of this, you'd like to use the type Enter type language fine, or just a filling full of what we read in the Old Testament, you'd have to look at the context of what is said in the Old Testament. And from that learning the greater lesson that is being taught in New Testament. The last one in the list is not a specific quotation. In fact, there's nowhere in the Old Testament does is there anything that that's looks like that he will be called a Nazarene. That's not found in the Old Testament. In fact, that's the only one that refers to being spoken by the prophets. So apparently, he is trying, he's summarizing a theme that occurs. But even the theme is somewhat of a mystery, we really don't know exactly what is meant by this statement, the root word of a Nazarene could have two different meanings. One is as close as closely akin to the word Nasser right. And he was a Nazirite. And azurite was one who was dedicated, who is holy to God. So it could be a play on the word holy, and there he is going to be a Nazarene. But it's also very much akin to the word branch. And we know that Jesus was going to be the branch out of the chute of out of the stump of Israel. So it could be either one of those but really don't know. So I'm not going to speculate cuz I don't know the context. So I can't really give any idea of how this feels full, the Old Testament counterpart. But I do really believe that if we think about this concept of filling full that and how the New Testament fills the Old Testament full, I think we have a clearer understanding and much clearer than simply some sort of prediction model. There's two passages, I know my time is quickly going away. But the two passages were I think this helps us, for example, in Galatians, four, and is relevant to our study. But when the fullness of time had come, God sent forth his Son born of a woman born under law to redeem those who went along, so that we might receive adoption, the adoption signs, the word fullness, there's obviously in the same family, as the word fulfilled. And then a Mark 115, where it says, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God has a hand repent and believe in the gospel. What is it? How can time be fulfilled? Clearly not in some sort of prediction model, I don't think, but rather, God had a plan.

Curtis Byers  48:16
And that plan was being executed from the creation. And in a year, by year, decade, after decade, century, after century, God was bringing to fruition, his plan. And so by the time he comes to the coming of Christ, and the New Testament, time, has been fulfilled, all the events in time they've had been planned and purpose it in the mind of God had come to completion. And they had filled full, the time that God has set aside for these things to be accomplished. And so in the fullness of time, God sent His Son, the time has fulfilled, the kingdom of God is at hand. I think the ideal feeling full makes perfectly good sense of these passages as well. So what is the point of chapter one and two, I'm going to put them together their unit? Well, chapter one tells us who Jesus is. He's a son of Abraham. He's a son of David. He's a son of God. And Chapter Two answers the question, Well, if he's the son of David, how did he come from Nazareth? Now those were those were questions people were asking. Let me look at two passages real quick, and Matthew 12. There's it all people are amazed and says, Can this be the son of good son of David, he had performed a miracle. And they were just questioning can this be the son of David? But Matthew would answer yes. He is the son of David. He's the son of Davies, the son of Abraham. He's the Son of God, He is the Messiah, there was prophesied and in John seven There it says, Some, when they heard these words, said, this really is the Prophet and other says, this is the Christ. But some said is the Christ to come from Galilee? Has that Scripture said that the Christ goes to the offspring of David, and comes from Bethlehem, the village where David was. So there was a division among the people. There are people in that day questioning whether or not Jesus was in fact, the Messiah. And Matthew is writing his gospel to answer that question. He is, in fact, the Messiah. And he he was born in Bethlehem, and through a circumstances of events, all predicted by scripture, all foretold by scripture, I should say, not predicted rid of that word, all foretold by Scripture. He he ended up in Nazareth. So yes, the Messiah to come from Nazareth. So how would I summarize all this? I'm gonna start with Oh, in chapter three, I need one more chapter. Because you turn the page, and the very first what is the very first words in chapter three are where, where we have John the Baptist in the scene saying, repent, the kingdom of heaven is at hand. So if you take these three chapters together, I would suggest this statement is to summarize what Matthew was trying to convey to us, in the opening of his gospel. Jesus, the son of Abraham, and the son of David is the Messiah. He is also the son of God having been been gotten by the Holy Spirit, born in Bethlehem, worshiped by the Gentiles from afar off his kingdom was a universal kingdom, supplanting all earthly kingdoms, even at a Rome and the person of Herod the Great, who dies unsuccessful in his attempt to destroy the child King, fulfilling all scripture, God's through Jesus will once and for all time lead his people out of exile to exile, his sin and separation into the kingdom that has now arrived. I think that you probably could word it better than I can. But I think that in an essence, is the lesson that we're to learn from Matthew one and Matthew two is wrapped in Scripture. It's all wrapped in Scripture. Because God is the one who controls all things. God has planned all things from the beginning for the betterment of his people. And we can read the New Testament, how that Christ has fulfilled the Old Testament, and much more than just, you know, here and there doing things that were foretold, but bring meaning and significance to those events that were told in the Old Testament. I appreciate your patience with me. I've gone longer than I intended to but hopefully those are the study has been some benefit. I would encourage you to continue to read and study these things. Have any questions, of course, please ask. But we would want to offer this invitation because the Lord offers the invitation. The very one who came into the world to save sinners, has offered the invitation that there is a way out of

Curtis Byers  53:13
that through belief in the Son of God and obedience to Him. One can have an entrance into that kingdom that will forever stand and will never be destroyed. They're in here this evening who are subjected anyway to that invitation. We encourage you to come as we stayed in the scene.
