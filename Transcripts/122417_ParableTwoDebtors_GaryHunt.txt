I believe everything's in order. It's good to be here tonight. And it's always good to be with the church here. Every time I come, I see many who are remember, but many who have not met. And I'm always glad to see all. Flora and I are glad to be here. And we are thankful to God for your continued love, encouragement, prayers and support as we labor in faraway Brooklyn, New York. And we're thankful again for the opportunity to be in your mitts, and we miss greatly being around so many that have been in the kingdom for a while now and are continuing on and for those maybe who have just started in His service. Tonight, we want to focus for a few minutes on one of Jesus parables. Although it's not even called a parable, but it meets every characteristic of a parable. That is the parable of the two debtors that is found in Luke chapter seven. Those who are more grateful for God's mercy will be more loving toward God is the simple lesson of the parable. But it's a lesson that we need to continue to remind ourselves of, and take it to heart. Because when our faith becomes weak, and our labor becomes lacks, then it comes down really to a lack of appreciation for the gracious love that God has shown toward us. And we need to be reminded of that, because if we understand the grace that has been extended to us in Christ than our love should be ever growing and ever laboring in his service and ever joyous and really uncontainable, so to speak, that we can't do enough in his service because of the grace that He has given. A parable is an earthly story, as most of us realize that's designed to teach a spiritual lesson about the Kingdom of God based on a comparison of earthly things. And although many parables are directed to crowds, this particular parable was directed at an individual his name was Simon. Simon, like most Pharisees thought he knew everything and thought he was in very little need of God's mercy. And he looked down upon others who were not so privileged to be in the spiritual elite, where he found himself. So we can say that Simon was self righteous, trusting in his own obedience, not needing the mercy of God much if at all. And for some reason, he had invited Jesus to his house for dinner. The reason is not given. But if we're not careful, we can become like Simon and we can think lightly of our sins, we can begin to think that we're pretty good people. And if we need some of the blood of Christ to be forgiven, we may not need as much of Christ's blood as someone else who is so horrible in their setting. We can begin to think of levels of sin and levels of grace of mercy and we're much better off because we don't need as much mercy and grace as someone else. That was Simon. This attitude led him to be impenitent. Ungrateful and unloving toward God and others. He just was not a very humble individual. He was proud. And so this parable of the two debtors begins to expose the shortcoming of Simon and the

Unknown Speaker  05:00
wonderful, loving, obedient faith of the woman that Simon called the Center who interrupted the supper. So now we just have three things in mind, the background of the parable, the parable itself and a few applications that we can take home with us and hopefully remind ourselves day by day, why we get up and spend our lives in the Lord's service and we try to do so tirelessly and fruitfully and joyously realizing that we can never repay God and we should never think of repaying God in such a way as for the grace, the unmerited favor, that he has poured out and continues to pour out upon us through Jesus. Luke chapter seven and verse 36. And Luke chapter seven and verse 36. Now one of the Pharisees was requesting him to dine with him why? They hated Jesus. They thought Jesus was an imposter, a law breaker a blast famer had the reason is not given. But in spite of the character of Simon, Jesus went to the dinner. And he entered the Pharisees house, and he reclined at the table. And there was a woman in the city who was a sinner. And when she learned that he was reclining at the table, in the Pharisees house, she brought an alabaster vial of perfume. And standing behind him at his feet, weeping, she began to wet his feet with her tears. Now we pictured this woman coming into the dinner. And she just starts crying over Jesus, wetting his feet with tears and drying his feet with the her hair, anointing his feet with the perfume that she had brought, kissing his feet, not asking anybody anything for anything. And kept wiping them with her head with the hair of her head and kissing his feet, and anointing them with the perfume. Now, when the Pharisee, who had invited him saw this, he said to him self, If this man were a prophet, He would know who and what sort of person this woman is, who is touching him, that she is a center. That's what he would know. Simon said to himself, and Jesus answered him. Have you ever, as you read through the Scriptures, think to yourself that you would pay a handsome price if you could see the expressions on people's faces Jesus talked to and what expression Simon might have on his face when Jesus

Unknown Speaker  08:38
is answering what he said to himself. That would have been an expression I would imagine. Jesus said, Simon, I have something to say to you. And he replied, Say a teacher.

Unknown Speaker  08:57
And so Jesus speaks to him in verses 41 and 42 of Luke chapter seven, this short parable of the two debtors. a money lender had two debtors who owed one owed 500 denarii and the other 51 they were unable to repay, he graciously for gave them both. So which one of them will love him more? Now, that is the extent of the parable very simple, but very profound. One owed 50 days of normal, laboring wages and the other owed 500 days of such wages, a dinero per day, denarius per day. And Jesus said, which one will love the gracious lender more? They both had their debt forgiven by this gracious lender they both were unable to repay to repay.

Unknown Speaker  10:09
And then poor Simon puts his own neck in the noose, so to speak. Answering correctly the meaning of the parable but failing to see the application to himself. Simon answers correctly about the parable which one of these two debtors will love him more when they were able to unable to repay? Verse 43 Simon answered and said, I suppose the one whom he forgave more did he suppose or was that a grudging said submission sort of brushing it off any deflecting it from himself? What Jesus is saying. He knew the answer. The one who he forgave more would love him more the one who knew beyond a shadow of a doubt that there was no possible way that they could repay no hope of finding a way of repayment in any timely manner. And he said to him, you have judged correctly. So Simon, you've got the right answer, but you don't get the point as it relates to yourself. Because in contrast with the lesser debtors, Simon who failed to see his need for God's mercy, He knew everything and he knew he was pleasing to God on his own. The greater debtor was the believing penitent, forgiven, loving woman

Unknown Speaker  12:01
that Simon had said was the center. Yes, she was a senator, but so was Simon. So we're all of them at the dinner there, of accountable age. All of them.

Unknown Speaker  12:22
Luke 744, turning toward the woman, he said to Simon, so Simon got his own personal parable. Now he Jesus is going through the painful application. turning toward the woman, he said to Simon, do you see this woman I entered your house, you gave me no water, for my feet, the bare minimum of hospitality. But she has wet my feet with her hair with her tears, and wipe them with her hair. You gave me no kiss, the very bare minimum of courtesy, and hospitality. But she says the time that I came in has not ceased to kiss my feet. What a travesty on the part of this Simon, who fancied himself among the religious elite, but he didn't even know how to love his neighbor as himself and treat Jesus with common hospitality that he would treat others you did not anoint my head with all but she anointed My feet with perfume. For this reason, I say to you her sins which are many have been forgiven, for she loved much. But he who has forgiven little, loves little. In fact, Jesus is really saying he's not forgiving at all. Because he doesn't even respond to the grace of God doesn't think he needs the grace of God hardly at all. Then he said to her to the woman, Your sins have been forgiven one of the three times that Jesus directly forgave sins on the earth, Luke five and Luke 23. The other two places. The man who was brought through the roof of the house by his comrades, the lame man and then the thief on the cross who was penitent of his sins. The one beside Jesus one of the thieves beside him Jesus. Now he forgot as this woman right in front of everybody, Your sins are forgiven because you loved much. What a humble display of pouring out her love toward Jesus. And Jesus said, You're forgiven. She realized her sinfulness in her native God's mercy. And she responded with all the love that she had. With all the love that she had those who were reclining at the table with him, began to say to themselves, Who is this man who even forgive sins? What a reaction. Don't you get the point of it all, that you are all greater debtors, unable to repay and your sin is great, and your love toward a forgiving God needs to be great with joy, a service unbounding service to Him. And He said to the woman Your faith has saved you go in peace. And so it reminds us why we should serve the Lord joyously and abundantly because of our love for His grace because of our utter sinfulness and undoing without his grace you know, sometimes I hear brethren recount to the Lord all regarding their material blessings, and and that's that's fine that we thank God for our material blessings, but really, in comparison to being forgiven of our sins each day, I don't think material blessings come close to that, do you? Correct me if I'm wrong? And would we not be just as blessed? If materially we had relatively nothing compared to what we have now, if we were forgiven of our sins each day,

Unknown Speaker  17:19
and if we could joyously serve him on some level, and in loving obedience, and thankfulness for that unmerited favor. All sin whatever the sin is, condemns us before God and this idea of so and so is a pretty good person, yet all they lack is baptism we ought and those words ought to never come out of our mouths. Am I right or wrong? Somebody said, Amen. So I will say amen. Also. Those words should never pass our lips. And in fact, maybe the reason we don't have as much success as we would like preaching the gospel, is we don't focus upon the sinfulness of humanity, and the need for the grace of God, maybe that's where we make our mistake. Because if I think I'm pretty good, then I am depreciating the grace of God right off the bat. I am thinking very little of the grace of God and that God is just so fortunate to have me in his service. And yet I give very little service if I'd appreciate the grace of God. All sin condemns us. All sin, whatever it is, James chapter two, in verse eight, James chapter two and verse eight. If, however, you are fulfilling the royal law, according to the scripture, you shall love your neighbor as yourself. You're doing well. But if you show partiality, now, that would never happen in the Lord's church, would it? Well, evidently it does, and it can. And he said, If you are showing partiality based upon snobbishness prejudice, elitism where we set aside certain brethren because they're not as educated as we are, they're not at the same social level as we are. They don't live in as nice neighborhood as we do, or they don't look like us. Then we're showing partiality. You are committing sin and are convicted by the law as transgressors. For whoever keeps the whole law and yet stumbles in one point, he is a pretty good person. Wrong. He has become guilty of all of all. In other words, we are condemned before God as centers. disrespecting one part of God's law, whether we think it's okay. It's not okay. It's still wrong in the sight of God. For a he who said do not commit adultery, also said Do not commit murder. Now if you do not commit adultery, but do commit murder, you have become a transgressor of the law. And we know that all sin brings about death and separation, now and for eternity from God. So that means whatever Simon sins were, they were just as despicable as that woman sins in God's sight, just as evil in God's sight, just as horrifying and condemning.

Unknown Speaker  21:33
All of us are in need of the blood of Jesus, to be forgiven of our sins. Blood of Jesus is not measured out in amounts, based upon the level of sin we have committed. The blood of Jesus was given for all people in regard to all sin. And we're just as much in need of the blood of Jesus to be forgiven all of us whatever our sins may be Ephesians one and verse seven, Ephesians one and verse seven. In Him, we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, according to the riches of his grace. And so when we acknowledge our need for the blood of Jesus, we are acknowledging our need for His grace and mercy. Therefore, there's no way we can earn our salvation, there's no way we can repay God for salvation. All we can do is reach out by the terms of pardon, the conditions of grace and when we do so we acknowledge how pitiful of a center that we are. And how much in dire need we are the grace of God. And that should provoke within us a loving response that says, how much can I do and your service, because I know it is only by your grace, by Your grace, that I'm forgiven, through the blood of Jesus, by Your grace, your unmerited favor, that I can be changed into any to the character that is more like Jesus. Through the gracious gospel, as Paul called it, the gospel of God's grace in Acts 20 And verse 24. It is all by His grace, that we are forgiven and that we can be changed into someone that God can use in His service. Ephesians two and verse eight Ephesians two and verse eight, For by grace, you have been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God, the salvation, not as a result of work so that no one may boast. For we are His workmanship created, created in Christ, Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand that we would walk in them by grace through faith. And so when the gospel is preached to an individual who is in need of the grace of God, and when that person responds to become a Christian, it is a sinner crying out for the mercy of God. Not a pretty good individual who just needs a little bit of mercy, we need all of God's mercy, all of it. Because our sins have completely condemned US before him and will completely condemn us for eternity, if we do not turn to His grace, and obedient, loving faith. We will remember when the gospel was first preached in Acts chapter two. And Peter came to the conclusion with the apostles about who Jesus was and communicated that to the Jewish people on that day, Acts 236. Therefore, let all the house of Israel know for certain that God has made Him both Lord and Christ, this Jesus whom you crucified. Now, when they heard this, they were pierced to the heart and said to Peter, and the rest of the apostles, brethren, what shall we do? We know we are condemned before God, we know we are in need of God's grace, God's mercy, what shall we do? Peter did not say anything about the center's prayer. Peter did not say anything about infant baptism, none of that. But Peter spoke of repentance and baptism based upon a belief in the Lord Jesus.

Unknown Speaker  26:36
And yet, there are so many false teachers who have the gall to say that baptism has nothing to do with the grace of God. And yet, instead of going down into the water, if I just mouth, the senators prayer, after one of these false teachers leads me in the senators prayer. If I do that, as they direct, then that brings the grace of God. But if I go down into the water, believing in the death and resurrection and the ascension of the Lord Jesus, that He's the Son of God, and repent of my sins, and go down into the water, and come up out of the water that does not bring the grace of God. And yet, what they tell me to do by the center's prayer is not in the gospel of his grace, the gospel of God's grace. But what we read here and acts 238. The first preaching of the gospel is, is in the gospel of his grace is in the apostles teaching is what we must do, as senators who are crying out for the mercy of God. Acts 238 Peter said to them, Repent, and each of you be baptized, immersed in water in the name of Jesus Christ for the forgiveness of your sins, and you will receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. That's calling out for the grace of God and showing love toward God by submitting to the conditions of pardon. Not the center's prayer, and not anything else that people come up with. And then as Christians as we continue to develop, growing in grace and knowledge and we sin again, then we continue to cry out for His grace and mercy. through confession, repentance and prayer. As airing Christians, First John one and verse nine. First John one in verse nine, If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. And so somebody says, Are we making a trade for all the things that we do? For God to save us? No, there's no trade here, because we're all in need of God's grace. And when we sin, the trade is over. There's no possibility of trade. We don't have anything of value to give except to show through contrition and obedience, our need for the grace of God and that is unmerited that is undeserved favor. There not only do we receive grace, though, that we may be forgiven of our sins but to be changed so that we think and act differently and desired differently than we used to before we became a Christian as we let the gospel work on our hearts, that we might be put off the old self and put on the new day by day. Titus two and verse 11. Titus two in verse 11, For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation to all men, instructing us to deny ungodliness and worldly desires and to live sensibly, righteously, and godly in the present age. looking for the blessed hope and appearing of the glory of our great God and Savior, Christ Jesus, did Paul just call Jesus God, they're marked that down and take a look at that. I believe he did. Or Jehovah's Witness friends seem to be somewhat confused. But Mark that verse, Titus 213, and take a look at Jesus who gave Himself for us to redeem us from every lawless deed and purify for Himself a people for His own possession. zealous for good deeds. Why? Because we're earning so our salvation No, because of a gracious loving God, we love him.

Unknown Speaker  31:36
We love him. And we love Him because He has paid the unpayable debt, for giving us of our sins and even even making it possible by his gospel for us to be changed into the image of His Son, day by day. And so that last point that we began the lesson with, we will end it with those who are more grateful for God's mercy will be more loving toward God. And this is something we always need to remember. When we become slack in this service, or when we try to talk to some brother or sister who has become slack in the service, it's a problem. Sometimes many times that we depreciate the grace of God. We just don't realize how undeserving we are and how loving toward God we need to be in joyous obedient service. Based upon that grace, He provides us each day. First Timothy one and verse 12, the apostle Paul, First Timothy one and verse 12, Paul said, I think Christ Jesus, our Lord, who has strengthened me because he considered me faithful, putting me into service, even though I was formerly a blasphemer and the persecutor and a violent aggressor. Your main Paul did not go to one the respected congregations. Paul was not raised in the church. Paul said he was a terrible senator. Blast famer persecutor, violent aggressor, yet I was shown mercy because I acted ignorantly in unbelief. Paul knew how sinful he was. He knew how great the mercy of God was. And he could not stop showing love for God through His joyous abundance service. And the grace of our Lord was more than abundant with the faith and love which are found in Christ Jesus, Paul said, it is a trustworthy statement, deserving full acceptance, that Christ Jesus came into the world to save centers among whom I'm a pretty good fellow. Is that what he said? Among whom I am for most of all. Sometimes we don't want to think about how sinful our sins are. But my under understanding is that because of the wonders grace of God, that is the only way that humanity can think about how sinful their sins Let me say it again. Because of the abundant grace of God, that is the only reason that humanity is able to contemplate how sinful our sins really are, how sinful we really are, and how condemned we are, without the grace of God. Yet for this reason I found mercy, so that in me as the foremost Jesus Christ might demonstrate His perfect patience, as an example, for those who would believe in Him for eternal life. Paul labored and labored and labored not to earn his salvation, but as a loving response to the grace and mercy of God through Jesus. And again, when we failed to labor, and when we failed to do those things, we need to think back about our need for God's mercy through the blood of Jesus. And by the gospel that changes us, day by day through the power, the same power that forgives is the same power that changes us by the grace of God if we will allow that, to rule in our hearts.

Unknown Speaker  36:30
First Corinthians 15 And verse nine, First Corinthians 15, and verse nine, for I am the least of four, I am the least of the apostles, and not fit to be called an apostle, because I persecuted the church of God. But by the grace of God, I am what I am, and His grace toward me did not prove vain. But I labored even more than all of them, yet not I but the grace of God with me, whether than it was I Are they, so we preach and so you believe that Paul not say that he has been he is changed by the grace of God. Not by his own doing, but by the market, marvelous gracious gospel of God. And then, finally, what about us? What about us, Second Corinthians five, Second Corinthians five and verse 14, Second Corinthians five and verse 14, for the love of Christ controls us. Having concluded this, that one died for all, therefore all died. And he died for all so that they who live might no longer live for themselves. But for him who died and rose again on their behalf. We live for him, because of the grace and love that he shows every day toward us. And as we seek to lovingly obey his will in all aspects of the gospel. It should be because it is an expression of our love. Not just not a grudging duty, but a willing, loving response that cannot be contained, that we must do all that we can do, as long as we have the time and health to be doing it. First, John five and verse three as we close our lesson. First, John five in verse three, for this is the love of God that we keep his commandments and his commandments are not burdensome. But are we earning our salvation? No. We are penitent, grateful, loving centers, who must, who must continue to be changed by the gospel and acknowledge our sins that we might be forgiven through the gospel, by His grace, all of it. And the more he shows us grace, the more loving we become, we've we love Him more and more. as years go on, as the days go on. Which debtor Are we are we like Simon who think ourselves not needing the mercy of God very much or like this humble penitent? believing woman who received the mercy of God and could not contain her love for the Lord. Jesus. Hopefully we are more like the latter than the former. And hopefully we will let our minds be renewed, that we will be more and more eager and zealous for every good deed that we are called upon to do by a gracious loving God whose mercy is available to us day by day. If you're here tonight, and not a child of God wants you to become a child of God only in the way that the scriptures teaches we just read previously. If you believe in Jesus as the Son of God, that he's now but he's now at the right hand of God ruling over Heaven and Earth after dying for your sins, and for the world sins, and being raised from the dead. You believe that then repent of your sins,

Unknown Speaker  40:57
they will be what condemns us to eternity, if we do not turn from them. They are all equally despicable and terrible in God's sight against his will. He did not create us to participate in any of those things. They do not bring glory to Him, but they bring grief to him, and they will ultimately bring about his eternal wrath, if we do not turn from them. But by His grace, he extends his mercy through the blood of Jesus. If you would repent of your sins, confess Him as the Son of God and be baptized, immersed in water, come up out of the water, trusting in God through the blood of Jesus who raised him from the dead. He will show mercy to you and forgive you of all past sins. And then you can begin a life of growing and His grace and knowledge being changed by his gospel day by day continuing in his mercy as we repent and pray and confess our sins as we go forward. That is what we would encourage any child of God to do confess our sins before God and others if need be and turn to the grace of God, that we may rejoice in His mercy and go forward and be more fruitful in His service. If anyone is subject to his gracious gospel, we would encourage you to come as we now stand and sing Let us stand
