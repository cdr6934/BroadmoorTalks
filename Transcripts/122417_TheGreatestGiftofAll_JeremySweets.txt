It is the season of gift giving, there's a lot of gifts that are going around. Most of you, my guess would be we'd be exchanging gifts sometimes this week. And if you don't exchange gifts this week, you probably are familiar with the idea at birthdays or another times. And so this morning, I'd like to talk about the greatest gift of all, the greatest gift of all. And I'll mention I try to be aware as I preach, and this is in every lesson in this lesson as well, of what's going on in the world. But this lesson is not an effort to chase what the world is doing. But this effort is always to the effort is to ask what does the Bible say. And so that's what I want to do this morning. I want to look to the scriptures and see what the Bible has to tell us about this greatest gift of all. First of all, notice that God is the giver. God is the giver of every perfect gift, every good and perfect gift James chapter one, verse 17, Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lines with whom there is no variation, or shadow due to change or shifting shadow. Here we see as we look at this passage, that God is the giver of every good and perfect gift, that which is good comes from God. Now previous to this verse, that passage says, Do not be deceived. And it says that because he's trying to say James is pointing us to the fact that sin does not come from God. And God does not tempt us to sin. In fact, that which is evil never comes from God. Only that which is good comes from God and everything good that we have comes from our father. When we experience bad things in life, we need not look to God and blame him. When we suffer from sin and its effects. We need not look to God and blame him. But when we experience the blessings of this life, we do need to look to God and think him. God is the giver of every good and perfect gift that which is good comes from him. I've used this passage several times over this past year. And it's a passage that we need to cement into our hearts. We need to understand truly that God gives us that which is good because he himself is good. He is a good God. And he gives us good gifts. Everything that we have, we need to look to God for Thanksgiving. And Matthew chapter seven, verses seven through 11. It points to the fact that our God is a good giver. And it says that we should be people and sons and children that ask of our father. Notice in Matthew seven in verse seven, asking that will be given to you seek and you will find knock and it will be open to you. For everyone who asks receives and the one who seeks fine, until the one who knocks it will be opened, or which one of you if his son asked him for bread will give him a stone? Or if he asked for a fish will he give him a serpent. If you then who are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children. How much more and more your Father in heaven give good things to those who asked him. Our father is one that gives good gifts on a continual basis. In fact, we know that that often happens between a father and a son if a son reaches out and asks his father for something, his father is going to give him what is necessary and what is good and needed. How much more will God our Father, give us good things. One of the lessons here is we seem it this idea of God being a good and awesome God. If we truly believe that we will be a people that ask of our father. So the first question this morning is do we do that in our lives on a regular basis? Are we asking of God? Are we reaching out to our good father? Or do we forget about him? Let us be those that ask for the text says Ask and it will be given. Seek and you will find knock and it shall be open to you. Let us be in asking people believing fully that God is a good good Have her.

Secondly, I'd like to point out that God himself became the gift. God has given us many things we owe our very lives the breath that we have the the sunshine, the rain, God gives us all those things. But the greatest gift that we could have is Jesus Christ Himself. And John 316, it says, For God so loved the world that He gave His only Son, God gave His Son and sent him to the earth for us. Consider the greatness of that good. God gave His Son He gave Himself in Matthew 121 through 23, there is a talks about Jesus birth that says of his mother, she shall bear a son, and you shall call his name Jesus, for he will save his people from their sins. All this took place to fulfill the Lord had spoken by the prophet, Behold, the virgin shall conceive and bear a son, and they shall call his name Immanuel, which means God with us. Now God has given us many blessings. But consider the greatest of them all. He gave himself, he gave himself God dwelled with a God came to be with us, and what a great blessing and a great gift. That is. I remember seeing a play when I was younger, called The Gift of the Magi, the Gift of the Magi, and it tells a story of a married couple. And they loved each other very much and wanted to get gifts for one another, but they didn't have the money to do so. And so Jim, and della are the two characters in the book. And della went and sold all of her hair, she cut off all her hair and sold it so that she could buy something very precious for Jim. And she bought him a chain for his pocket watch. Well, Jim wanting to get his wife a gift, but having no money, he sold one of his most precious items, he sold his pocket watch, in order to buy combs for his wife's lovely hair. And in that story, we see the sacrifice of law, the willingness to give to sacrifice of her own, and we see that great love in that marriage. But as we see that Jesus came to the earth for us, and God dwells with us, consider the sacrifice that he gave for for what is metaphorically referred to as his spouse, and Ephesians 525 to 27. It says, Husbands love your wives, as Christ loved the church and gave Himself up for her, that He might sanctify her, having cleansed her by the washing of water with the word, so that we might present so that He might present the church to himself in splendor, without spot or wrinkle, or any such thing that she might be holy and without blemish. Jesus sacrificed, not just something that was of little value, he sacrificed his life. Now that story points us in the direction of Jesus, but it really doesn't do us justice does. Jesus gave everything for his bride, the Church, he gave of himself. Now, incidentally, that that message is used to instruct husband and wives today isn't husbands are to love their wives in the same way. And that's a challenge for us is, how many of us can raise our hands and say, We love our wives to that degree? To that extent? And if the answer is no, we don't which I think everyone here would not be able to put ourselves to that standard, are we looking to that as our goal? Are we striving to love our wives more and more? We don't need to have the attitude of fairness in marriage, this isn't fair, she needs to pull her way. That's not the idea, the ideas of sacrifice, of giving of yourself for the other one. And we need a greater sense of that in all aspects of life and particularly in marriage. Let us look to Jesus Christ, and how he acted. In that occasion, Jesus Christ gave of himself and x 20 and verse 28, it talks about the church of God which He purchased or obtained with his own blood, the very blood of Jesus Christ was given. God is the giver of every good and perfect gift and the greatest gift that he has given himself to die on the cross for us for our sins.

The Gift of Jesus Christ enabled us to have salvation The gift of salvation. And it's interesting how many times the word gift is used in association with salvation. So I would like for you to open your Bibles with these passages. Here, this is really the heart of what I want to look at. So open your Bibles to Ephesians. Two, as we begin Feagins two

Jeremy Sweets  10:30
I have verses eight and nine. But I'm going to go ahead and start in verse one. Good. I think that's an important part of the passage there. Ephesians two, verse one. And you were dead in the trespasses and sins and what you once walked following the course of this world, following the prints of the power of the air, the spirit that is now working in the sons of disobedience, among whom we all once lived in the passions of our flesh, carrying out the desires of the body and the mind. And we're by nature, children of wrath, like the rest of mankind, But God, being rich in mercy, because of the great love with which He loved us, even when we were dead in our trespasses, made us alive together with Christ, by grace, you have been saved, and raised us up with Him and seated us with him in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus, so that in the coming ages, he might show the immeasurable riches of His grace and kindness toward us in Christ Jesus, For by grace, you have been saved through faith, and this is not your own doing. It is the gift of God, not a result of work so that no one may boast. Here we see this idea of the gift of God, our salvation is considered the gift of God because it's nothing that we could purchase for ourselves. It's nothing that we could earn before God, we could not look to God and say you are in debt to me. Salvation, it says instead is a gift. It is the gift of salvation through faith. Notice now in Romans chapter three, Romans chapter three. In fact, there's a series of passages in the first half of Romans that point us to the fact of salvation being a gift of God. And Romans three in verse 23. There says, For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, and are justified by his grace as a gift through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus, whom God put forward as a propitiation by his blood to be received by faith. This was to show God's righteousness because in his divine forbearance, he has passed over former sins, it was to show His righteousness at the present time, so that we might be just so that he might be just and the justifier of the one who has faith in Jesus. Here we see that all have sinned and fall short. But justification can come by the gift of God. And Romans five verses 15 through 17. Now this follows the passage that that Jesse read for us as we look to what Jesus did in verses six through 11. He continues that same theme by saying that Adam introduced sin, and as we imitate Adam and follow after his actions, we also have sin as well, but Jesus Christ brought live notice in Romans five and verse 15. But the free gift is not like the trespass, for if many died through one man's trespass, much more have the grace of God and the free gift by the grace of the one man Jesus Christ abound for many, in the free gift is not like the result of that one man's sin. For the judgment falling one trespass brought condemnation, but the free gift following many trespasses brought justification for it because of one man's trespass, death rain through that one man, much more will those who receive the abundance of grace and the free gift of righteousness reign in life through the one man, Jesus Christ. Here we see the gift as it's placed beside the condemnation or the sin of Adam, in Romans six and verse 23.

Jeremy Sweets  14:33
The most succinct of our passages, but it points out what I want us to see. There. It says, For the wages of sin is death, but the free gift of God's eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord. Now, as we look through this passage, we need to understand that the free gift is placed alongside something that we have done and we see part of the reason why it is a gift of God something given that we can did not earn what is placed beside this idea the free gift is our sin. That you notice that in every single passage in Ephesians, two, it starts off with the fact that we have sinned before God, we are dead in our trespasses and sins, in which we want walked, we have all lived according to the course of this world. According to the prince of the power the heir speaking of Satan, we've lived after in the indulged our own desires and our own flesh, that is a picture of sin, and that is what we have done. And we have earned death because of it. In Romans three, For all have sinned, For all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God, but but we are justified by God, you have that but that transition in Ephesians, two as well don't. We have all sinned, but God as it transitions to what God has done for us. In contrast, in Romans three the same thing, All have sinned, but we are justified by his grace. In Romans five, it places the sin of Adam and those that would sin and like manna, alongside what Jesus has done for us as a free gift. We have earned death, Jesus has offered salvation. And in Romans six and verse 23, The wages of sin is death. And we've already established earlier in the book that all have sinned. So what does that mean that all have earned, all have earned death. All have earned death, but the free gift of God and eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord, in Christ, Jesus our Lord. Now we need to be careful, the Bible does not teach that everyone sins, and then Jesus came in everyone is saved. The Bible teaches that salvation is freely offered to everyone. It's freely extended to everyone. But as we saw in Ephesians, chapter two, it is those that live through faith that depend upon God, that that what to him, that ask, that fall upon His mercies. It is those that live by faith in God and His saving work, that will receive this great gift. And so we see the necessity of, of a heart, a submissive heart, and a faithful heart, before God. So as we look at these passages, we, we need to understand that that idea of the gift is associated with salvation. And the reason that is is because of what we have earned for ourselves, we have earned. Now combine this with the previous point. And we see that God being the gift and why that's so important, because Jesus Christ did something for us that we could not do for ourselves. Now, as we'll exchange gifts over the next days, I'm going to receive some presents and my kids will, they'll be nice to have. But I'm not sure it hits this level of something that I absolutely could not get for myself. We live in a wealthy society for the most part, if we want something, we can go and buy now. No, there's limitations. I don't, I don't have a yacht. I don't really have desire for yacht, there's limitations to that. But we are a wealthy people. And for the most part, we can get what we want. When the new gadget comes out, we can get that but when it comes to this subject, we are absolutely destitute. We absolutely have no hope

Jeremy Sweets  19:08
of receiving salvation by ourselves. We are in complete need and dependence. If God does not give it to us, we have no recourse. We can't work enough. We can't spend enough overtime enough hours devoting ourselves to receive this gift. It is only through his generosity. It is only through the sacrifice of Christ that we have a hope of salvation. So we need to be thankful for that, don't we? And we need to show gratitude for God's gift. And Luke 17 And Luke 17 We find the story of the 10 lepers that were cleanse And they call upon Jesus to cleanse them. And Jesus said, Go and show yourselves to the priests. And the text says, and the end of verse 14. And as they went, they were cleansed. Then one of them when he saw that he was healed, turned back, praising God with a loud voice, and he fell on his face at Jesus feet, giving thanks. Let's start small, and then look at this passage and then compare this to what we're talking about. Even if we receive a $10 gift card, or if we receive mittens or, or some gloves or something like that, we need to extend our appreciation. It's customary and expected that we would say thank you for even the smallest gift for someone that would think of us in those terms. Here we see the the, the one that was healed, the leper, his life was saved. And he turned back to God. With Thanksgiving. He fell on his face and praise God. Now, how much more should we be thankful for eternal life? for eternal life? It is hard to imagine, even in physical terms, what we would do for someone or how we would feel for someone if they saved our life. If our life was dependent upon a kidney or an internal Oregon and someone donated to us, that Oregon, how would we feel we would fill in it needs to show profuse of Thanksgiving, the outpouring would feel inadequate, we would want to say thank you over and over again. So how much more when it comes to our salvation? And how much do we say thank you, to God for what He has done. For that great gift that we could not procure, by ourselves. We need to show gratitude to God. We can do that with our words. And we need to do that with our words and prayer and praising God. But we also need to do that with our lines and honoring God for what He has created us. In Ephesians, two in verse 10. I read through verse nine, it says, For by grace, you've been saved through faith, and that not of yourselves and as the gift of God. Here we see in verse 10, as it continues to thought, it says, For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand, that we should walk in them. God saved us because of His great love. Ephesians two establishes that, but he also saved us for a purpose, for a reason. And that is that we would walk according to His good works that he has set out and established, so that we would reflect upon him reflect His goodness to others, so that we can live according to what he has designed us to be those that live in Christ Jesus for good works. If we're truly to show gratitude, we will honor his wishes and his intentions by living a godly life. He did not save us from sin, so that we could continue in sin. As we look through the passages, we see that in Romans chapter six, Romans chapter six that's in the midst of all those private passages that we read previously, talking about what God has done for us. What what Jesus did for us at the cross, Jesus did

Jeremy Sweets  23:50
not die, so that we continue to live in sin. Romans six four says, We were buried therefore with him by baptism into the an order that just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, we too might walk in newness of life. That is our purpose and God's intent for us. The question was asked earlier in that, that text and Romans chapter six and verse one, should we continue in sin that grace may abound? And how does he answer that? He says, No, you should not and he points them back to their baptism. How should we know how we should live? We should look back to our baptism. When we were baptized, we were buried with Christ to put to death the old man of sin. But we didn't stay there, did we? We didn't stay submerged in water. We were raised to walk in newness of life. And so as we rise up out of the waters of baptism, we have a renewed You are a new commitment. We have a new direction in our life, we have a new hope in God, we have a new outlook on on what it means to live and what God has done for us. We have a new perspective completely. And so now we're not going to go to the old way of thinking, the old way of living, the old way of selfishness. But instead, we're going to be raised to walk in newness of life, living a godly life before him. As we give gifts this week, if you do that, or as you think about the giving of gifts, let us not completely divorce that from what God has done. Let us remember that God has given us the greatest gift that could possibly be given. If you're here this morning, and you're not a Christian, God is offering or extending that gift to you. He wants you to believe that Jesus is the Christ to repent of your sins turn away from a lifestyle selfishness and, and self service to serve Him. confessing that Jesus is the Christ and being baptized in the water for the forgiveness of your sins. When you're baptized, you're putting to death the old man, and you're raising the walk and newness of life. If you are a Christian this morning, you've been raised in baptism already. And you've already made that commitment. And if you're not honoring it, you need to honor it again. Whatever the situation, you find yourself in this morning, if you need to make your life right, do not do anything else. Without doing that your soul and your spiritual condition is the most important thing in this world. So make your life right. There's any subject to the invitation. Please come as we stand and sing it this time.
