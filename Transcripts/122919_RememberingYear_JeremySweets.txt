Good morning. Good to see everyone here. I had thought when I came here that we'd be a little bit sparse because I knew that so many of our members were away. But as was mentioned, we filled in with a lot of visitors. So we are glad that you're here. We welcome you here. We're glad that you came here to worship with us. It's so important that we take time to to remember God and all that he has done. So we're glad that you are here with us this morning. Please, yes, these three and verse one says, for everything, there is a season and a time for every matter under heaven, a time to be born and a time to die, a time to plant and time to pluck up what is planted, a time to kill and a time to heal, a time to break down and the time to build up and it continues on from there. You know, there is a time for what is new, and there is a time for what is old. And we're experiencing that right now. We're in a transition period, aren't we from one year to the next. And this happens every year. The transition from old to new happens often not only with time as a year, but also when we leave. When we leave. Say for example, in elementary school, we move up to middle school, and we leave college and start a job. When we leave an old job and take a new one neighbor, we're leaving single life and harried headed into married life. When we move from old house to a new house, well, you get the idea. There are times when we leave what is behind, and we head into what is new. And we are doing that right now with this year. We're ending a year and we're starting a new one shortly. This is the last Sunday of this year. And so I thought it would be a perfect time to really reflect on the past year, remembering this past year, I think we can look to Scripture and find some good things that we can learn by looking at this past year. And if you're really talented, you can not only remember this past year, but this past decade, this is the only last Sunday of the year, but the last Sunday of this decade as well. Every year I try to write a little note that we send out to people thinking back on the last year and it's hard to remember the beginning months. So that's can be a challenge to think back the whole year. But if you're able to do that, I think it's beneficial. And like I said, if you're talented, you can look back past over the last decade. Well, the Bible actually is a little bit ambiguous about looking back at the past. And so I want to notice a couple of passages. And Isaiah 43 In verse 18, there it says, Remember, not the former things. Now in this context, God says that I'm about to do new things, he is preparing the way for something new. And so he says Don't, don't look or don't dwell upon the old, I'm ready for something new. But we also see in Isaiah 46 And verse nine, when God says remember the former things of old, and he talks about the fact that I am ancient, I am the Ancient of Days, I have no beginning. Don't, don't go for the new idols, or that which is a new philosophy, but rely upon which is old and standard. And so we see both of these elements. And it really comes down to the way in which we look at the past. And so as we look at the past, I think it's unhelpful to dwell in the past, to try to live in the past. So think about the old, the good old days, and I wish we could go back to the good old days, I think that that is a harmful way to look at the past, to simply want to live in the past. And the reason for that is because if you're living in the past that doesn't allow you to live in the presence. It doesn't allow you to move forward and do what is good and constructive. But this way of looking at the past, if we are to reflect on the past, that actually is a way of looking at the past and reflecting considering what has happened so that you can live better now, so that you can live in a more gracious, humble and thankful way. So I think it's very appropriate that we would reflect on the past not dwell there, but reflect on it. So let us notice some ways that we can reflect upon this past year. One of the things we can do is remember that time is short. Time is short. Can you believe another year is already passing? I don't know about you, but it seems to me like it is flown by and I say that every day

Jeremy Sweets  05:01
It's not anything new. Time flies by when the psalmist wanted a quick reply from God and his distress. He stated this in Psalm 89 In verse 47. Remember how short my time is? Psalm 89? The Psalmist is crying out to God answer me quickly. Don't leave me in my distress. He says, Remember how short my time is? Why think it would do us good, as well, to remember how short our time is. And as we reflect on a prior year, we realize especially how short time is, in James chapter four and verse 14, there it says, What is your life for you're a mist that appears for a little time and then vanishes away. Our lives may seem long to us and one aspects we have decades and years to live. But in another aspect, it is a mere blip in the grand scheme of things. Our lives are Miss, there are a vapor, and you can see them just for a second, and then they vanish away, then they are gone. That is what our life is. And I think reflecting back upon time in this prior year, helps us recognize what's involved in that and how quickly our lives are passing. And how short our time is. And I think it's helpful for us to realize that our time here is limited. fusions five says that we are to make the most of our time Redeem the time, use our time wisely. And if we realize that it's a limited resource that we don't have all the time in the world, then we will make the most of it, we'll use it to the best of our, to the best advantage that we can. So the first thing I'd suggest is that we remember that time is short. Secondly, we out ask that we remember what God has done in this prior year. Remember what God has done. It would do us good to simply sit and reflect what has God done in my life in this past year. When the Ark of the Covenant returned from the Philistines, Bible says in first Corinthians or First Chronicles chapter 16, that David appointed Levites as ministers, and he sang this song of Thanksgiving, oh, give thanks to the Lord, call upon his name, make known his deeds among the peoples in verse 12, skipping down a couple of verses that says, Remember the wondrous works that he has done, His miracles and the judgments he utter. Remember the things that he has done, David, praise God. And part of the reason that he could give praise and thanksgiving to God is because he reflected on what God had done for them. He reflected upon the good thing. God has provided so much for sees provided blessings, and James one in verse 17. There we see that every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lions with whom there is no variation or shadow due to change. God is the giver of every good gift, that which is good comes from God. So I would simply ask you, in what ways has God blessed you this past year? And you'll have to answer that yourself. Now I know that he has, he's blessed us all, but reflect upon the ways that he has blessed you. Or it may be that things God has done is that he has listened to you and answered your prayer. We know that God listens and answers our prayers today and he provides what is best for us. Now he doesn't always answer affirmatively. formatively I don't know if I have that. Right. He doesn't always answer in the affirmative. But he does seek what is best for us just like a parent does, doesn't give a child everything that they asked for, but seeks to do what is best. That is what God does for us. We are to be a praying people. God wants us to pray to him and cast our hearts, our desires, our anxieties upon him. In Philippians, four in verse six, it says do not be anxious about anything. but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God. And again, in first John five and verse four, or 14, and this is the confidence that we have toward him, that if we ask anything according to His will, He hears us.

Jeremy Sweets  09:55
We should never get over how amazing the fact is that our God here is The US are God in heaven, the creator, the God of all the earth. Billions of people are in this earth, and God wants each and every one to pray to Him. And God will listen to each and every one. So I would ask you, in what ways has God answered your prayers this past year? And if you remember those prayers, and those answer prayers, I hope you will also make time to offer a word of Thanksgiving, to give a word of thanks to him, Be us because we are specific in our prayers. But we're not always as specific and our Thanksgiving are we we can go down the line as far as what we would like for God to do for us. But sometimes we're very general. Thanks for all of this, we need to be as specific in our word of thinks as we are in our word of request. We need to be like the one leper, who returned when he was healed. And Luke 17 of the tin, one came back and thanked Jesus. Let us be like that individual. We also see in Scripture, not only does God bless us and answer prayers, but God also provides for us, and this may overlap with blessings. But we see that God has providential care for us and for our lives. And we see that in scripture we particularly see that with someone like Joseph, we see that and examples like like Moses, Ruth, Esther. And it's difficult for me to say that God is doing this right now in my life, or to say maybe in the future, I would like this, and God is providing this for sure. But it's much easier for me to reflect upon the past what God has done. I don't want to pigeonhole or or say this is what God is doing right now. But when I look at the past, I think I can see that easier. I think Joe, Joseph could see that easier. When Joseph spoke to his brothers at the end of Genesis, he stated this, as for you, you meant evil against me, but God minute for good to bring it about that many people should be kept alive as they are today. I don't think Joseph could have made that statement, or had those thoughts in the midst of his crisis. I don't think he understood that or realize that. I don't think it's easy for us to say exactly what God is doing in the directions, we're headed in some of this providential care. But I think it's easier as we look back, we can see God's hand. So in what ways has God the splott displayed loving Providence for you in this past year? What are the ways that you see that God has been working in your life, we need to remember what God has done. God's done a tremendous amount for us. And we need to remember that we also need to remember God's people, our brothers and sisters in Christ can provide a great encouragement to us. And it would do us good to reflect, to think back to remember, upon the good that they have done for us, we can be encouraged as we think about our brothers and sisters in Christ. We can remember Christians who have passed away this past year, you may notice that the world celebrates those that have passed in the prior year. And they do that by talking about different icons of industry or, or entertainment and say, and look at what they have done. We can remember Christians who have passed away, that's not a matter of worshipping our ancestors or praying to the departed. But this is a matter of reflect, reflecting, and being encouraged by the lives of faithful individuals. Sometimes we begin to think like Elijah that I alone, am a servant of the Lord. There are many that are striving to serve God and it would help us to reflect upon them. Hebrews 11, in fact celebrates the lives of men and women that live by faith. And in Hebrews 12, it opens with this phrase, there are since we therefore since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses. Let us lot lay aside also every way to and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us. Looking to Jesus. We see that

Jeremy Sweets  14:49
the writer of Hebrews says that we are surrounded by this cloud of witnesses, these people have faith and we can be encouraged to run Our own race in the face of their faith. Well, I wonder if some of those witnesses are not just the ones enumerated in Hebrews chapter 11. But we could be encouraged by other people, people that we have no, in one sense, ordinary people, not those gifted with supernatural abilities, not those like we see like Superman, or we attribute all these great powers to people. And Hebrews chapter 11, these were people just like us. What made them amazing was not their physical strength or intellectual ability, but their faith, their faith, and we can be encouraged by that faith. Paul reflected upon the faith of Timothy's mother and grandmother, in second Timothy one and verse five, and that may be whether they had passed or not. But he says, I'm reminded of your sincere faith, a faith that dwells first in your grandmother Lois, and your mother, Eunice, and now I'm sure dwells in you, as well. We can reflect upon the faithful lives of Christians who have passed but are also still living, and may help us to reflect upon those that are continuing in faith in difficult circumstances. For example, in Colossians, four, verse 18, Paul says this, remember my chains? Remember my chains, Paul was in prison and had been prison for the preaching of the Gospel, yet he continued to be faithful. And Hebrews 13, in verse three, it makes a similar request. Remember those who are in prison, as though in prison with them and those who are mistreated, since you also are in the body? Now, the ones that he's particularly are talking about in prison and mistreated are Christians, those part of the body, those that are, are continuing in their faith, despite their challenges. So I'd ask you what faithful Christians you do you need to remember from this past year, what encouragement can you gain from others that are striving to please God and serve him faithfully? Not only do we need to remember those things. But we also need to remember our commitment, our commitments, have you made a commitment this past year or even in years prior? In Numbers, chapter 15. There's an example there of where God, let me begin before that, but God made a covenant with His people. And we often see of God saying that I remember my covenant, I think he also wants His people to remember their covenants. So in numbers 15, the passage I referenced, God instructs the Israelites to make tassels on the corners of their garments. And their to do this as a reminder, notice what it says in verse 37. And it should be a tassel for you to look at and remember all the commandments of the Lord, to do them, not to follow after your own hearts. So you shall remember and do all My commandments and be holy to your God. God wanted His people to look back upon the commitment they had made in the covenant and honor that in their present lives. Do you see how there's a difference? Thinking back to our opening, distinction between dwelling in the past and reflecting so that we can live in the present? This is an example of reflecting so we can be better people better servants of God. Think back to your commitment so that you can honor it now.

Jeremy Sweets  18:45
So that you can follow what God wants you to do now. Remember your commitments. Paul also provides a reminder in the New Testament as well. When Paul consider the question about whether Christians should willfully sin in order to increase grace in Romans chapter six, he answered with this emphatic cancer, God forbid, absolutely not. Should we just sin a whole bunch so that God will heat grace upon us? He says, No, but then he follows that up with a reminder. He says in verse three, do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his death? We were buried therefore with him by baptism into death, in order that just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, we too might walk in newness of life. Paul says, I want you to reflect back and remember your baptism because that has implications for how you live now. Your baptism is where you put to death the old man and you were raised to walk in newness of life. Your baptism is where you made a lifelong commitment to God. So how can we continue in sin, Paul says, That's contrary to the commitment we made to God. When we were baptized, remember your commitment that will affect how we live now. In Revelation, the church at Ephesus was accused of having abandon their first love. They had left their commitment. And notice what the writer says in chapter two and verse five. Remember, therefore, from where you have fallen, repent and do the works you did at first. What is John calling upon the church there to do? Remember their commitment. They had fallen from their original commitment. They had a first love, but they had become lukewarm in their service. They had become unmotivated, unexcited, they had fallen out of the excitement, the zeal and the fervor that they needed to have. They had lost sight of their commitment, Hatton. And John says, Remember from where you have fallen and repent, have you fallen away from a prior commitments? Have you stumbled and sin and become lukewarm in your face, then you need to remember your prior commitments, and be faithful to the Lord. That's the That's the lesson that I have for you this morning. I'd like to just point to two more things about God and what He does. There are some things that God remembers, and there are some things that God does not remember. God remembers those who live in faith before him. One great example of this is Noah. And Noah and Genesis chapter eight and verse one, it says, But God remembered Noah, and all the beasts and livestock that were in the ark with him. Now, what's important about Genesis eight one is that becomes that comes right in the middle of the story of Noah, as the floods come, and the heavens break loose and the floods come out, and the earth is destroyed. That judgment that happens upon all of the people happens before chapter eight. And it's very climax of that, right before the waters begin to recede. It says that God remembered No, he wasn't going to bring judgment upon him. He remembered his his commitment, his life of faith and how he lived. I believe that God remembers those who live in faith before him today as well. God will remember you, let us live by faith. But thankfully, God also forget something. In Isaiah 43, in verse 25, it says, I am he who blots out your transgressions for my own sake, and I will not remember your sins. God doesn't forget because he is forgetful. God forgets because he is loving, gracious, forgiving, and calm. As we

Jeremy Sweets  23:16
think upon this past year, allowed that reflection and those reflections to motivate us to be more godly and live in a godly way before Him. Many things come and go. But really, really, there's only one thing that matters. And that's our relationship to God. I'm thankful that God will remember us, and that he will forgive our sins if we will come before Him and lay our our hearts before him requesting that forgiveness. Maybe someone here this morning, that's not a Christian, you have an opportunity to become a child of God. Bible says you must hear the gospel message, repent of your life of sin, make a commitment to follow God all of your life. And then you must confess that Jesus is the Christ and be baptized in the water for the forgiveness of your sins. Having made that commitment, you begin your Christian wall. I suspect that most of us or many of us have made that decision here this morning. Well, we need to remember our commitment. And if we're not honoring it as we should then we need to recommit ourselves, read about ourselves. Remember from where we have fallen, and repent. If there are any that are subject to the invitation at this time. Please come as we stand and sing
