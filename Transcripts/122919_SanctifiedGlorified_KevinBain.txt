Good evening, it's good to be able to assemble again to today and offer our prayer and praise to our God. It's good to be out. Certainly, as chances mentioned, to be able to assemble together in a comfortable, I hope you're somewhat comfortable and Dr. Building grateful for the opportunity to speak from God's word hope what I have to say will be helpful and useful to all of us. As we begin not only as we begin a new week, but as we begin, soon to be a new year in our lives. Sometimes the stories from the Bible that we need to hear most aren't the most pleasant stories. They're not those that are uplifting about the righteous people that have overcome through God's help. Sometimes they're just sobering stories. When about when God's people for suck him and did things their way and paid the penalty. Paul in First Corinthians chapter one. And verse 10, reminds us of that, when he speaks of that we will face some of the same temptations that those people in Bible history faced. And if I'm prepared, we will be overcome by some of those same things ourselves. What brought this lesson about was, we studied a few weeks back and Kurt's class and in Acts, Acts chapter four and verse five, that's where we'll spend most of our time tonight. So you may be turning to Acts chapter four and verse five. In there, the story of Ananias and Sapphira. And it stirred up in my mind again, the judgment of God and the sobering thoughts about how God dealt with some people in Scripture. So I decided to go back and look at some of these things. Not only these, and an ISIS, Safar, but others that were dealt with pretty harshly as we might think, in our, in our minds, so the thought tonight is, why will be sanctified, will be glorified. And we see that found in Leviticus chapter 10. And verse three, where we see one of the incidents we'll look at, and the mindset that God has for us, toward him, and toward his will toward his plans for us. So as we begin the fifth chapter of Acts, we need to go back to recall some of the things that had taken place in the previous chapter in chapter four. The information in Chapter Four is going to be contrasted to some that we see in Acts chapter five to make the point or make the story pretty clear. Remember, in Acts, chapter four, that Peter John were taken into custody, they were arrested for preaching about Jesus. And they in the temple, however, the Sanhedrin couldn't, couldn't keep them, they couldn't constrain them or hold them because of the at that time, there had been an undeniable miracle healing of a crippled man, so and the people were praising God, and so that they were unable to, to hold them, most likely, for that reason, because the people were there praising him. So after threatening Peter and John, we see what the Sanhedrin let them go, they return to their friends, they, back in chapter four, they pray for boldness and continue to have as we see kind of the state of the early church. And that was the thought there of having one heart, and soul. So we get a picture of what maybe the early church look like

Kevin Bain  04:37
in their unity, their love their care, they're concerned about each other. And we see that in verse 32, of Acts Chapter forces. Now the full number of those who believed were of one heart and soul and no one said that any of the things that belonged to him was his own, but they had Everything in common. So we get here a good picture of what the early church looked like they were of one heart and one soul, their devotion, we see their devotion, their dedication to each other. And we see that really exemplified in the man Barnabas, or, or the man named Joseph that was given that name, Barnabas by the apostles renamed, so to speak by the apostles, Barnabas and what he did, as Chapter Four closes, we see what what he had done, barber sold, a field that he had, that he owned, and brought the money and laid it at the apostles feet. So we see that the common love concern that there was in verse 34, there was not a needy person, among them. I think that tells us a lot about the state of the early church that love that there was not one person among them that was in the they had all that they needed. Their mindset was the mindset of really stepping up for each other, and supporting one another in when they saw that someone was in need, they provided that. And so that's that's the picture we have of, of that early church. But as we see in chapter five, the first word in chapter five, probably in in some of your versions, is the word. But chapter five begins with the word but the group of believers had all things in common selling their goods. But now we come across a husband and wife name Anna nice and Safar. And we'll see what happened in their lives, we again, we see that their attitude was joyful consideration, there was no one in need. barbus sold his land and presented it at the positive speed and the money was collected. And now we have a case of analyzed and so far. So when we think about that, and kind of what happened, you see the sin. Beginning of verses one and two, we'll read that chapter five, but a man named man and is with his wife Safar sold a piece of property. And with his wife's knowledge, he kept back for himself some of the proceeds and brought only part of it, it laid it at the apostles feet. And I sold a piece of profit property and he decides that he wants to keep back part of it. Part of the proceeds. His wife SAFIRE is fully aware of what's going on is though they've discussed what what is chosen what they've chosen to do. Analyze comes and lays the the money at the apostles feet. And so, they, we see in verse three, what Peter has Peter keys on this? And he says, in verse three. But Peter said, analyze, why has Satan filled your heart to lie to the Holy Spirit? To keep back for yourself part of the proceeds of this of this land? Let's look some of those of some of the statements that are made here by Peter. First, I don't think the text is saying that Satan over took and a nice, I don't think we see that so that he had no choice but to lie. He had he didn't have a choice. We see that Anna Nisa Safar willfully, willfully did this. And Peter's asking why he would fall into Satan's trap by lying. And we will when we look at this, it seems like just it's a victimless crime really.

Kevin Bain  09:36
I mean, what's what's the harm and keeping some of that money? They convinced themselves that no, no one was gonna be hurt by what they did. So, we see this maybe as as a victimless crime. No one's gonna be hurt. What wouldn't be there anybody in what we were doing? So, you know, as, as we might say, what's, what's the big deal? So, second, many people misunderstood. I think the condemnation here about an ice Some think that the sand was keeping keeping some of the money. And then I add a nice was required to give all of this. He was required to give it all. As you look back in chapter four, the end of chapter four it seems like or maybe it's understood there that when they sold their property that they were giving it all seems to be the case in Barnabas specifically. But I think we continue to read the store we'll see if that's clearly not what happened that he wasn't required. They weren't required to give everything of this of the proceeds. It doesn't seem to be that they it was necessary that they gave it all. So we see there in verse three and verse four, that God sees things differently. Peter in verse four argues that analyze could have done with the money as he chose verse four raise While it remained unsold that did not remain your own and after it was sold, was it not at your your disposable disposal the first sentence there why it remained unsold it did not remain your own, I think shows that he didn't have to sell the whole property, or they did sell the property in the first place. The property was theirs did have to be so Peters next sentence was and after it was sold, was it not at your disposable disposal shows. Even though they did sell the pro prop property, the proceeds could have been done as the as they pleased. So there's no real restrictions they were doesn't seem to be that there are really real restrictions on that. But Peter, I see think we see Peters indictment, really Evanna nice is saying. And when you think about it, there was no real good reason for what they did for Anand is hypocrisy, so to speak, and what they presented to be one thing and was not what it looked to be a way of deception, away of hypocrisy, so to speak. And so I think there's a couple of things we can look at. And I think the sand was not in holding some of the money back. But verse four clearly states or identifies what the sin is, in verse four, he says, You have not lied to man, but to God. And I think we see clearly there what what the problem was, what the concern was. So I think, two lessons we see so far. When we lie, we must remember who we're lying to or who we're trying to lie to. And not only that, that hypocrisy never fools, our God. We live lives of hypocrisy that doesn't fool God. And I think that's clearly saying in this particular case. So we think about God's judgment here. What did they lie about? What was it that they lied about, though? It's not. I don't think it's explicitly stated here. But it's evident that and a nice lie that they gave all the proceeds from selling the property they gave all

Kevin Bain  14:30
or that's what he projected. When in fact, they held some of the money back

Kevin Bain  14:38
and a nice was not condemned for keeping some of the money. He is condemned for lying what he gave, and I think that's what we see. And as soon as that happened, we see what happened, or that judgment In verses five, let's look in verse five. When analyze heard these words, he fell down and breathed his last and great fear came upon all who heard of it. That phrase there great fear came upon all upon all who heard of it is something I want to focus on that is going to be a key passage or a thought. In our study, so the husband and wife team, they, they tell the same law, both of them see the same fate. And we'll see that in just a minute. So now, a few hours later, about three hours later goes goes by so far, the wife of analyzed comes into the group, and we see doesn't seem like she knew what had happened. Not knowing what had previously gone on, Peter asked her the question, if they sold the property for a certain amount? And she says, Yes, we did. We sold it for this amount. And we see that she says yes, and she's calling that same liar. She, she agrees, and deceives. In that same lie, as well. So Peter here notes that they kind of conspired in this together, they were in this together. And then we see the judgment pronounced against her that immediately she failed out of his fate and died. And then again, you see what it says there. At right after this. What happened? The same description in verse 11, it says, in great fear came upon the whole church, and upon all who heard of these things. God strikes now to add a nice a few later, a few hours later, he strikes down Sapphira, too. And so the judgment is made, the judgment is determined. But again, that thought there about great fear came upon the church, not only the only the whole church, but also those who heard about it. So this action or this judgment, by God had spread. And I think that's one of the points in what we're looking at that that fear coming up on the whole church and spreading to others. So we may ask why, and nice and so far lied about this. Why would they lie? What's the benefit of lying? What was the benefit to them about lying in the way that they did, about what they sold the property for? I want to look at a couple of other situations or similar judgments against some other people in Scripture. Before we answer that question, to continue with that a nice and Safar. A couple of other incidents, incidents where God struck down, killed people in the Bible. Let's look in Leviticus chapter 10. Probably these are very familiar to us. Nate Ave by Hugh and Leviticus chapter 10. And that's in this passage is where that thought for the title of the lesson. Leviticus chapter 10. Beginning of Leviticus is God's commands about about the sacrifices about how they were presented, or to be presented, how are they how they were to be offered. And they dive in by who've come before the Lord offering, what was considered an unauthorized

Kevin Bain  19:19
unauthorized fire. And we see what's happened happens to them and let Leviticus chapter 10 We'll look at verses one through three and eight have in a by you the sons of air and he took his sensor and put fire in it and laid incense on it and offered an authorized fire before the Lord which he had not commanded fire came out from before the Lord and consumed them, and they died before the Lord. Then Moses said the Aaron, this is what the Lord has said. Among those who are near me, I will be sanctified. And before all the April I will be glorified. And Aaron held his peace. So in this situation, you see that they had offered this unauthorized fire, something that we would say, Well, what's, what's wrong with that? It's just a type of fire that may have worked better or differently. What's, what's the problem with that? And I think we could see, the reason for that judgment again, is it was not done, as God had commanded. Because they understood I think we can, we can understand that they knew what the proper way to present these offerings and they sacrifices word. And that's why the statement is made, that I will be sanctified will be glorified in this situation. So I think again, we see a judgment made against a dab and a bias you. What was the point that Moses was making, I think, when we try to do things our way, or glorify ourselves, and not God, that is where the problem is that God must be glorified. God must be glorified and all that we do. Another situation we see a story of, of Cora, and the 250 Israelite leaders in number chapter 16, verses one through 35, Cora, the some of the Israelite leaders had complained about their situation, Moses, and Aaron had kind of been receiving, or as they thought, all the attention because they were in charge. And they were getting maybe jealous or upset, but because they had received, they were receiving the attention, they were in charge. And as though they were not satisfied with the duties that they had, they had duties, they would have been given to ease. But they weren't satisfied with those. And there was seems to be a type of jealousy. And they say, a verse 16 And three, verse 16, number 16, verse three, they rebuked Moses saying that he had gone too far, far by exalting himself above the whole assembly in 16, and three, and we see that and in 13, later in verse 13, we see that kind of repeated the charge again, do you also have to appoint yourself a prince over us, we know who we know who pointed these men to be in charge, and it was God, certainly God had done so. And so Corps and the leaders were complaining that they weren't the ones to get the attention. They weren't the ones in charge, they weren't the ones getting the glory, they felt Moses and leaders were receiving too much glory and honor for what they were doing. And I thank God, in the latter part of that chapter in verses 34, and 35 kind of validates that Moses and Aaron were the leaders. And they were out of place and doing what they did, and they were consumed, the ground opened, and the 250 of the people were consumed by by fire. And so again, I see, I think we can see that. In this case, for these men, their desire for glory got in The Guardian, the way they were consumed. And then Uzza in Second Samuel chapter

Kevin Bain  24:13
seven, six, as a second Samuel chapter six, verses three through eight, we see that another case there, even when we have good intentions, when you think about us have the intention that he had to prevent the art from falling off the cart. That was a good intention. We would say, look at that, say there's nothing wrong with that. You know that he was, he was doing what we consider to be a good deed. What he was doing was good, his intentions were good. When we do not do as God has commanded, we're assuming the power and the glory ourselves and attempting to place it on ourselves as ahead Think ahead. Excellent and intentions, I think there's no disagreement about that, and preventing that the Ark from falling off the cart. But what do we know that God had commanded that no one was allowed to touch the ark. And only the sons of Kohath could touch the poles that carried the ark. And that's described back in Numbers, chapter four. God struck us down for touching the Ark against the commands of God, God takes His commands seriously. And I think that's part of what we want to understand tonight. God expects us to keep his commands when we do not we are claiming glory for ourselves.

Kevin Bain  25:53
So go back to analyze and so far and accept or five. Why lie? Why did they lie? When they didn't have to? I think we can see probably one of the things is they wanted the glory of giving the proceeds

Kevin Bain  26:28
from the proper they property they sold, and most likely they went Barnabas gave, he was giving property there others that had given property. selling their property and giving the proceeds. It seems as though adenitis they want the glory, given the proceeds from the property they sold they wanted. Maybe it was that they want the other believers to be impressed with what they had given. I'm not sure but it's just hard to understand why they hid would have lied about that the amount that they gave. Maybe they sold a more expensive piece of property. And they wanted to impress the other Christians, the new the new Christians in the church, maybe that's what it was. We have to watch out for that trap in our lives as well. We have to, I think be aware of the temptation to give part while acting like we're giving all just basic hypocrisy in our lives to giving part while we're acting like we're giving all I think, maybe that not only did they won't, maybe you want the believers to be impressed, but I think they perhaps maybe they were trying to outdo what Barnabas had done. Barros had sold a piece of property and given the proceeds, maybe they wanted to, to do as a go one step more, and outdo what Barnabas had done. It's just hard to understand why they would have lied about this. Maybe to one up Barnabas and and so that the people would think that they had really done a great thing in what they had done. The temptation had been placed there for self promotion, they promoted themselves and what they were doing. really tried to impress the congregation there in Jerusalem, perhaps that was part of what they were thinking at the time. They wanted the glory of the people.

Kevin Bain  29:09
We say a similar thing that happened to to solve in First Samuel chapter 15, verse 31st, Samuel 15, verse 30. That he didn't, he didn't utterly destroy the amplicons as he was instructed that God commanded him to do his his desire was there to receive honor from the elders and from the people and what had been done. And I think from this story of analyzes so far along with these other people, we can see that at least three applications that we can make that why these people were struck dead and their attitudes and Let's just look at three applications that we can make about this. I think number one that God hasn't changed since the Old Testaments, three of these were in the Old Testament. But the case regarding add a nice and soft Safar will was a New Testament, situation or story. So God hasn't changed, he is constantly doesn't change his character, his concern about being his people honoring him, showing him reverence, and all that we do, that has not changed from from the Old Testament, as we can see, it's it's sometimes more judgement type situations in the Old Testament, but that hasn't changed. And I think one of the other things is that God punishes what we might call trivial offenses. When we look at these sins that things people died for, we wouldn't say that they were very, you know, they weren't what we would call major sins or grievious sins so to speak. But, again, God punish is what we would call trivial offenses, I don't think any of these will be what we would consider as monumental in our minds, they're not monumental sins, some might say they're no sense at all.

Kevin Bain  31:46
So you know, when we think about those, those the things that they did, in our minds, they may not have been that severe, they may not have been that big of a deal. But to God, certainly they were. Now when you take it a step further, consider these people these people were not what we consider heathen people. They were not what we would consider unbelievers. All these people were that were the people of God, you think about Native in a by hue. They were priest of God Corps was a leader in the Israelite community, as it was an Israelite and an ISIS fires. Safar were baptized Christians. God didn't strike down, unbelieving murderers here or adulterers. It was the people of God that we're punished. There's nothing really that we can call trivial. In the eyes of God, there's no command that we can come across in Scripture that and suggest that's really not a big deal to God. Because because it is, it seems clear to me is, as I see this, and look at this, in my mind, the reason that God struck these people down was to make a point to the community of believers. And you see that term use that when Anna nice was struck down, there was great fear when safar was drugged down, there was great fear among a lot of people, among the community of believers among the church. And among those outside, possibly, as well. I think the, the fact or the the point that God is trying to make was to those believers is the same point that I'm trying to make here now is that when God said something, He expects us to do it. And to do it his way. Let's not think that repentance from sins is not important to God. Because it is, let's not discount baptism as some type of good idea. Let's not take any command that God is uttered and treat it with anything but great respect, and all and I think that's what attitude that he required of those people. That's exactly the attitude that he expects from his church today. Again, as we read Acts, chapter five, verse 11, his great fear comes upon them when they heard about those things. This is the attitude the type of attitude of holiness that God wants from us, I believe as well. God punishes not only those trivial offenses, but he must always be glorified. I believe there is the even greater principle we see in First Peter chapter four. First Peter chapter four, verse 11. Or read that passage there first Peter four and 11. He says, Whoever speaks is one who speaks oracles of God, whoever serves as one who serves by the strength that God supplies in order that in everything, God may be glorified through Jesus Christ, to Him belong glory, Dominion, forever and ever. Amen. Not only must God be glorified, but obedience with the motive of motive of personal glory is the same as disobedience. And an Essence of Fire, I thought they were doing a great thing. They thought they were doing a great thing by selling that property and letting, letting that money go to the to the church to those who were in need the needy saints. But this act of charity was condemned, was condemned by by God, because their motive was for personal glory as it seems. Their motive was for personal glory. Matthew chapter six, in verses one through four, talks about how that we would do nothing, in order to be seen by people

Kevin Bain  36:49
practice our righteousness. Not to be seen by others, but to receive a reward from God. He destroyed in an ISIS fire to leave us with no doubt about what the fate of lies and hypocrisy always will be. I think that's one important thing. And the principles I think, are very are these that God was trying to establish in the way that he made judgment against these people. In our desire to be holy and godly, let us not discount what God has told us we must do for him. And that we should strive to live in such a way that the glory of God can be seen in us, and then others will look to glory to God and glorify Him. And everything. Let us bring glory to our Father. We see that in Matthew chapter five. Matthew chapter five, verses 13 through 16. You're the salt of the earth. But if salt has lost its taste, how shall its saltiness be restored? It's no longer good for anything except to be thrown out and trampled under people's feet. You're the light of the world, a city on the hill cannot be hidden, nor do people light a lamp and put it under a basket, but I'll stand you and it gives light to all in the house. In the same way, let your light shine before others so that they may see your good works and give glory to your Father who is in heaven. Thank you for your attention. And I hope this has been helpful to you in the way that God expects us to live lives that are wholly sanctified lives, lives that please our God and Father. If we can help you in your walk as as a Christian, tonight, we want to do that we want to be of any help that we can to pray for you to help you. Do the things that you need to do to live a more holy life sanctified before God if you're not a Christian, and you know what you need to do if you've heard the word and you will repent of your sins, confess his name before this group, we will be glad to baptize you into the body of Christ, the body of believers. So if we can help you in any way, come now as we stand together and sing
