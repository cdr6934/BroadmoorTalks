Spring God this morning is Amen to it's what we've done with Ben said, appreciate so much. So songs car that you've led versus we'll be looking at a Texas morning in Psalm 63. Norm, thank you for those thoughts and prayers, we pray to God reminding ourselves of the brevity of life the end of one year, and on the verge of in a new year, thank you leave your thoughts at the Lord's up. There's something humbling about the end of the year. This is the last day we worship God collectively. As we look forward, we reflect back on our lives, where we've been, what we've done, how well we've done, how poorly we've done, and with the hope of making improvements every day of our lives. So you surely gives us an opportunity, as we've come this morning, to think about what we can do is we seek to become more and more like Jesus Christ. We've been focusing on my class on Wednesday and I, and living daily in God's presence. And so that's, that's one of the things that we can do to help us keep our faith strong or thinking clearer is we navigate the difficulties and the challenges of this life. You know, we often talk about people that I get to say, excuse me that in light of everything this week, very busy week, my voice is a little bit raspy. So if I sound more like Kenny Rogers, instead of me, don't ask me to sing because I certainly won't sing like him. But anyway, I'll use my voice to the glory of God, as we all are imperfect in our service to Him.

Mike Roy  01:33
But again, I want you to think with me about this concept that we have. Sometimes we talk about people who are consumed with themselves, maybe they're consumed with their jobs. They're consumed. We live in a society that's consumed with sports, or with all types of things that we can be consumed about. Sometimes we talk about people who are obsessed with things, sometimes with other people, sometimes with germs, or neatness or something else like that. We usually talk about obsession, or this consumption and sometimes a negative way. But I want to talk this morning about being obsessed in a positive way, and consumed in a positive way. And I want to challenge each of us this morning, not to be consumed with unimportant things in life is so easy to let little things dominate our thinking. We're controlled by things that have no lasting significance. And so I still think about a lesson that buddy Payne prefers years ago called The Magnificent Obsession. God is magnificent. And we need to obsess over him totally and completely, in every facet of the meaning of that word. We give our total devotion and obsession to God himself. In Psalm chapter 63. This psalm shows us a man who was consumed with God who was obsessed with God. David was a godly man who lived daily in the presence of God. And and so when we talk about David, we might say that he was a man who was obsessed with God. Sometimes they like I don't want to be radical, what, in terms of serving God and knowing God and loving Him and OBEYING Him, this is the only area in which you should be extreme, and give God your complete loyalty and worship and praise and even obsession, I want to suggest to each of us, that if we're going to overcome the trials and temptations and the distractions of this life, then we to like David must be consumed with God. He is our hope he is our refugees our strength. So this morning, I thought since I had this opportunity to speak on the last Sunday morning of the year, we've been looking and mainly in the book of Psalms about what it means to live in God's presence. This is not insignificant language. This is a real challenge for us, I thought we'd take a look at Psalm chapter 63. This was not on my list of Psalms to discuss this quarter. So it gives an opportunity to take another look at one of the psalms that does talk a great deal about the concept of living in God's presence. So give us a chance to take a look at that this morning. So my challenge to each of us from Psalm chapter 63, the title by lesson is consumed with God if we're going to be consumed with something or someone. Let's be consumed with God. That's what David shows us in Psalm chapter 63. So I want to just briefly look at some key words in this text. And then I'll be looking at several points I want to make and reading some of these verses as we get into Have a psalm. And again the songs that Kyle lead are so meaningful.

Mike Roy  05:05
So just notice some some statements about David in his relationship to his love for God, His desire for God. And verse one, he says, I shall seek you. He said, My soul thirst for you, my flesh yearns for you, says, Thus I have seen you. In verse three, my lips will praise you. In verse four, I will bless you. And then in verse six again, when I remember you, I meditate on you. Verse eight, my soul clings to you. And then in verse 10, but the king will rejoice, I will rejoice in my gods what David saying. So I just want you to see, throughout this, this brief Psalm, how totally dedicated David was to serving God and how consumed he was, with God did David not have problems, or trials or difficulties, he had many of them. But David was a man who found a way to work through his problems and overcome his problems. And so this psalm is filled with these, this language that shows a total devotion and dedication to God. So I want to observe this morning a man that David, who was consumed by God, he was a man who lived in God's presence as to challenge for each of us as we seek to be stronger Christians. We think back over this past year, our failures and shortcomings, but we look forward to a new year if God give it to us, where we can be stronger in our faith, more even evangelistic in our efforts at saving souls. But notice a man who was who was consumed with God. Look at verse one. So Psalm chapter 63, verse one, oh, God, you are my God. I shall seek you earnestly. My soul thirst for you, my flesh yearns for you, in a dry and weary land when there is no water. It's compelling. Again, if you sing that first song, kind of lead for us or one of the songs. David has talked about God who is close to the God of heaven and earth, the Creator of all things, the Sustainer of life, the redeemer of mankind. He said, Oh, God, you awesome God, you are my God. You are my God, the God of heaven and earth is My God, what a personal statement of faith that that David makes there. So he says, Oh, God, you are my God. He said, I shall seek you earnestly. One of the keys to living in God's presence is continually seeking Him not just one time, but continually seeking His will, seeking his face seeking His love, His Holiness, all of that. So we see David as a man who sought after God, he was a godly person who put God first in his life, in everything that he did. And again, the language over here, he said, My soul thirsty, you my flesh yearns for you, the NIV puts it this way, my, my whole being, my whole being longs for you. Do you long for God? With your whole being, your heart, your mind, your soul, your strength, your flesh, David says, with my whole being I long for God. And I think as Kevin suggested in the class this morning, that trials of our life are not to make it supposed to make us bitter, but better. And we learn from those things that became they become stepping stones to greater faith and stronger faith. And so we see David is a man who was in fact consumed with God, because He continually sought God sought God's grace in his strength. And this is one of the most important commands in Scripture, Matthew chapter six and verse 33. In the context of worry about our food and clothing and all that type of thing Jesus said in verse 33, But seek first his kingdom, and his righteousness, and all these things will be provided for you in terms of learning God's will and accept the 17 with Paul was Friskies his message at Mars Hill, he talks about God and He's not served by human hands as if he needed anything rather, he himself gives everyone life and breath and everything else. From one man he made all the nations and that they shouldn't have it the whole earth. He marked out their appointed times in history, and the boundaries of the lands, this was the NIV and God did this so that we would that they would seek Him. So the one of the most fundamental actions that God wants us to, to engage in our own hearts is to seek him to pursue Him with all of our strength and

Mike Roy  09:56
when we search for him, Jesus tells us we'll find him asking it will be given, knock and the door will be open, seek, seek and you will find but it's not a casual seeking. It is an intentional seeking. Whereas a Psalm says, Oh God, I shall seek you earnestly. So we see the first characteristic of David, a man who was possessed by God have consumed with God, I shall seek you earnestly. Secondly, he said, I have seen you. David says about God, I have seen you in the sanctuary. Look at verse two. You said, Thus I have seen you in the sanctuary to see your power and your Glory. When you gaze at the greatness of God, you cannot remain unchanged. One of the songs that we sometimes sing, I probably could have suggested to Kyle is, my eyes have seen your glory. And when you gaze at the glory of God, when you gaze at the power of God, when you gaze at the holiness of God, in the love of God, it changes who you are and who I am. And so David is a man who is obsessed with God, he's consumed with God. He said, I will seek you earnestly. He said, I have seen you. When you see who God is, it changes everything about your character, who you are, who you will become what life is all about. And again, it gives us the perspective as we prayed this morning, that this year is coming to an end life is brief, we're here to we are here to praise and honor God to obey his will to teach our children to do the same, to reach out to those who are lost in sin. But notice, again, this is David man who is consumed with God makes that simple statement I have seen you in the sanctuary. And reminds me the passage in Psalm chapter 2427 And verse four, we looked at this one at the first class we did in our class on living in God's presence, he said, one thing I asked him the Lord, this only do I seek that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life, to gaze on the beauty of God, the gaze on the beauty of the Lord to and to seek Him in His temple. So David's greatest desire in the light, was to come to the house of God and worship Him, and to gaze a God's beauty, lot of things in his life that are beautiful. We think and think about his creation, and as a lot of ways that we can make application to that. But the most beautiful being to for eyes to gaze upon is God Himself. And when we gaze at God, it strengthens us in our faith. And we see all the great Bible characters who witness God's power and glory. They were they they impacted the world around them, Moses did, Isaiah did. Daniel did, John did, Paul did, and a message in Hebrews chapter 12. Again, in the midst of the challenges of life, we're to fix our eyes. on Jesus, where are you looking? Where are your eyes going in gaze? What are you gazing at? Both eyes, gaze at the wrong things. Don't you be gazing at bad stuff, needs to be gazing at God, seeing his holiness, and keeping our eyes fixed on him. And so as we look at David's life, he was a man who had seen God in the temple in the sanctuary. Thirdly, in verses three and four, David said, I will bless you, or thank you and praise you. So go back here to the text with me. He said, because your loving kindness is better than life, my lips will praise you. So I will bless you, as long as I live, I lift up my hands in your name. So David's life was impacted because of who God is and wasn't what God had done for him. And David was man who was seeking God, he had seen God. And as a result of that, this is kind of a natural progression. Because when we make it our practice to, to seek God, to look at him to gaze at him, we have to be thankful for all that he has done for us. So he says, Because of your loving, because your loving kindness is better than life, my lips will praise you. And that's what we do this morning. That's why it's so important to be in the assembly of God's people. This is not legally legalism. This is not something to

Mike Roy  14:29
throw us a burden on Christians as we worship God, it's part of how we grow in our faith as we honor God but as we ourselves are built up so it's a natural thing that we bless God, we thank God for what He has done. And and then even the language the inverse for I will lift up my hands and in your name. So the outward action of worship that David engaged engaged in was because of what God had done where what David had said mean in looking at God and the process of seeking God. The fourth point I want to notice in this text this morning, as we look through this data sets out, I remember you and meditate on your Look at Verse six with me. And verse six, he says, When I remember, I mean, just read through verses five and six, my soul is satisfied as with marrow and fatness, my mouth offers praises with joyful lips, when I remember you on my bed, I meditate on you in the night watches. So one of the things that David did as a man who was consumed with God, is he remembered God, is that something that we have to teach and stressed and admonished each of us to remember God? We do, because there are too many distractions. This led to many things, getting our attention. And so David was a man who did it forget who God was, his greatness, his strength, his mercy. And I think this is kind of a Hebrew parallel parallelism over here when he said, When I remember you on my bed, I meditate on you in the night watches. So again, David had lots of stress and strain that he dealt with constantly on the run, at least at times in his life, much to be concerned about some, no doubt, some worry, all that type of thing. But one of the things that David did, he remembered God, of all the things that we need not forget, don't forget about God. Think about him, dwell on his power, dwell on his providence. I'm standing here today because of God's grace, thinking about where I was before my conversion to Christ, and who I am today and my family and all of that. David remembered, God, let's not forget God's greatness in his power. We certainly need to, to think about what he has done for us. I think about the charge that God gave Joshua after Moses death and and and Joshua, chapter one, verses eight and nine, Moses has passed away. God says to Joshua, keep this book of the law. Keep this book of the law, always on your lips, is God's Word always on your lips, my lips, it needs to be. And he says, meditate on it day and night, consciously, we've been encouraging each other, all of us to be engaged in some type of a daily regular reading a Bible reading schedule, it's so important to do so.

Mike Roy  17:40
And none of us do it perfectly. But as I've been going, looking at my app on my phone, I realized one more day and you see that little bar coming every time you do a reading, it goes through over here like I'm making progress is helping me and with the help of my son in law, my daughter and others were looking at it a Chronological Bible reading plan for the new year. You know, the most exciting thing you can engage in is the study of God's word physics and chemistry and biology and history is all interesting. But when we make the study of God's Word, the number one pursuit of our lives, it gives us the greatest satisfaction that we can possibly having sold are challenged and is to meditate. That means think about it in the daytime and at night. It's not an uncommon thing I would suspect for all of us, as our we go to bed or try to go to bed, our mind is racing and all that kind of stuff. Even at night, what do you do? Maybe pray, quote, scripture, The Lord is my light, the most my my strength, his mouth, my salvation. Philippians 413 I can do all things through Him who strengthens me. That's what David was doing day and night. So David was a man who was meditating on God's word, and meditating on God's powered day and night. The fifth point I want to notice this morning, I have a few more to share. In verse seven, David said, I will sing your praises in the shadow of your wings. So notice over here, and chap, Psalms have to 63 and verse seven, for you had been my help. And in the shadow of your wings, I sing for joy again, and one of the songs that we sing this morning again reminds us that, that God is our health, he is our strength, he is our refuge. He is the lifter of our head, you know, and from a practical standpoint in preaching and I've been doing this for a while, quite a long time. And so many times I think I just want to get this right. I want to get the illustrations, right. I wanted to get the scriptures right and I often don't do that in the end is God's power. And God is the one who lifts my head. I don't do it by my strength. He helps me to do the he helps all of us to overcome the challenges that we each face. But that's what David is saying is you look at a man who was consumed with God, you You have been my help in the shadow of your wings. I sing for joy wise David, underneath the shadow of God's wings. He faced many, many, many difficulties, but in the shadow of God's wings he could even sing. And it reminds me this in Psalms and Acts chapter 16, verse 25, when Paul and Silas are in Philippi, thrown into jail for preaching the gospel, what are they doing? What are they doing? About midnight, Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns to God, and the other prisoners were listening to them. God was listening first, but other people heard what was going on. So no matter where you are in your life, whatever, whatever uncertainties or difficulties that you're dealing with, like David we can, we can sing for joy. In the shadow beneath the shadow of God's wings, I trust His grace, we all need to trust His grace. So David said, is a man who was consumed with God, I rejoice, I sing for joy underneath the protective power of God's wings. He does that for David. He does that for you and for me, for each one of us. And so it's a reminder that no matter what difficulty we're facing with, and even if you're thrown into prison, because you're a Christian, you can sing in the cell, you can do that. It is a choice. If you focus on who you great God is. Number six. And really, look at verse eight. You said, My soul clings to you. So again, use of words and and scriptures that we oftentimes don't,

Mike Roy  21:46
don't really stop to think about. So after saying, you know, you've been my help and the shadow of your wings, I sing for joy, my soul clings to you. And he might be saying, My soul clings after you so day there was a man, that in the deepest recesses of his soul, he clung to God, who you're holding on to, I hold on to my wife, my children, brothers and sisters in Christ. Do you hold on to God put your arm around in my soul, David says, My soul clings to you clings to his promises. So many of the psalms that we read back the psalm that we read a couple of weeks ago and chapter 17, we again showing how David lived in God's presence. In verse seven, he says, wonderfully show your loving kindness, oh, Savior of those who take refuge at your right hand. And so, we look at Psalm chapter 370 63. And David was a man whose soul with this all he clung to God. One other point that I want to make. To bring this lesson to conclusion we see David is a man who in fact was consumed with God, he was obsessed with God with doing God's will. But again, in spite of all the difficulties that he faced, David rejoiced in God. And again, it's not because he lived a life, free of pain and trial. He had all types of trials. In fact, look at the context over here, verse nine. He said, but those who seek my life to destroy it, what they're trying to kill David, they are trying to kill David. Those who seek my life to destroy it will go into the depths of the earth, they're gonna fail, but I'm gonna, I'm gonna win with God, they will be delivered over to the power of the sword. They will be a pray for foxes, the animals will eat him up. But he says the king, I'm gonna rejoice in my God. So again, David didn't live a life free from pain, free from trial, free from grief, free from regret all that stuff. But Dave, his confidence was in God. Let me say this here, but the king will rejoice in God, everyone who swears by him, will glory that means everyone who makes a commitment to God to keep that covenant, and be faithful to God will be the ones who who are full of glory. You said, for the mouths of those who speak lies, will be stopped. And so again, it makes me think of Philippians chapter four, Paul's writing from the Ritz Carlton in the area of Rome, I think, when he wrote this, no, he was he was in prison. He was in a prison, in jail. And what does he do? He says, Rejoice in the Lord always. Even while you're in a jail cell. Rejoice in the Lord always I will say it again. Rejoice were Christians. My name is in a book of life. Your name is in a book of life if you obey the gospel of Christ that gives us the greatest joy and satisfaction possible. So Paul says, Let your gentleness be evident to all the Lord is near. Do not be anxious about anything but in every situation by prayer and petition with thanksgiving, present your requests to God, the peace of God, which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus. So I think as we look at David, we see a man that, even in the midst of all his challenges, was a man who rejoiced in God. So Psalm chapter 63, so shows us a man who was consumed with God. And that's how God teaches us he shows he can tell us to be consumed with him to love him to put him first in our lives, or he shows us people who did that. So Dave was a man who said, I will seek you, I have seen you, I will bless you and praise you, I remember you, I meditate on you, I sing your praises in a shadow of your wings, my soul clings to you, and I will rejoice in God. So the question is morning for each of us. Is this question? Are you consumed with God?

Mike Roy  26:10
Or are we consume with ourselves? Or we consumed with our pain? Our trials? Are you concerned with your own happiness? Are you concerned? Or are you concerned with God's will? Are you concerned with your own difficulties? Are you concerned with your financial challenges? That can be something that creeps into our mind? But God always provides for each one of us? Are you concerned? Are you concerned with the health issues? Those are national things to have concerns about? So what are you consumed with? Are you consumed with God? Or are you consumed with yourself? Well, if we give God the first place in our lives, he'll he'll meet all the needs that we face with on a regular basis. And what it means to be consumed with God means that we're going to put his word his will first in our lives will obey His Word in terms of faith and repentance, and baptism. That's how we become a child of God. It may be that there's some this morning who need prayers for your struggles and assistance in helping to get that total devotion and consecration to Almighty God if you hear this morning, you need to respond to the gospel in any way. We invite you to come while we stand and sing this invitation song
