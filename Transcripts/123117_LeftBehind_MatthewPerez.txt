Do you have a favorite story about Jesus? A lot of stuff in there and Matthew, Mark, Luke and John. But what is your favorite story? Perhaps for you, though favorite story is when he first unveiled himself as a miracle worker, when he changed the contents of liquid from water into wine at the wedding of Cana in John chapter two. Or maybe it's perhaps where he unveiled himself as this man can actually defy nature, as he walks on water and approaches his 12 disciples, again to find the laws that we know a lot of great stories of Jesus in our Bibles again, and Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John. And again in the book says it's sufficient. The book right here that we have sufficient to know all the things that he did, so that we can believe and have faith in our Savior Jesus. But do you ever wonder, what was he like, as a boy? What was he like as a teenager? Maybe some parents don't really want to think about that. But what was he like as a boy? Was he more of the quiet time around the house? Or was you always correcting his brothers or sisters? When he was growing up? Was he always playing outside? Did he always want to be with his dad going to work with him every day? Was he consistently reading, praying, helping the Bible? This doesn't really give much insight to any of that. But there is one story in the scriptures, and Luke chapter two, where give some little bit of insights of a story of a boy, Jesus. I do want to say, good evening. It's good to be here with you guys a serve to worship and just to rejoice in the Lord and His salvation and what we have through him. Always good to meet new Christians. I know some familiar faces here as well, too. And it's just, it's great to see I guess, an extended family in Nashville. You've got guys already been so welcoming to me. In fact, this morning and the book of Ruth, we studied the house of Perez. I appreciate it guys. That slowly jumped to the Gospel of Matthew, I was it was great. But it's great to be with Christians as we kick off the new year, what better place to be? And where would you else would you want to be? Tonight, we'll be in Luke chapter two. And we're going to start in verse 41. I want you to read this with me. Luke chapters two starting in verse 41, it says his parents went to Jerusalem every year at the feast of the Passover. And when he was 12 years old, they went up to Jerusalem, according to the custom of the feast. When they had finished the days as they returned, the boy Jesus lingered behind in Jerusalem, and Joseph and his mother did not know it. But supposing him to have been in the company, they went a day's journey, and sought him among their relatives and acquaintances. So when they did not find him, they returned to Jerusalem seeking Him. So it was that that after three days, they had found them in the temple, sitting in the midst of the teachers, both listening to them, and asking them questions. And all who heard him were astonished at his understanding and his answers. So when they saw him, they were amazed. And his mother said to him, Son, why have You done this to us? Look, your father and if such you anxiously, instead of them? Why did you seek me? Did you not know that I must be about my Father's business. But they did not understand the statement which he spoke to them. Then he went down to with them, and came to Nazareth, and was subject to them, but his mother kept all these things in her hearts. And Jesus, increased in wisdom and stature, in favor with God. And man. First point tonight was, according to their custom again in verse 42, and when he was 12 years old, they went up to Jerusalem, according to the custom of the feast. That's it, right there is kind of showing that his parents spiritual reflection on what priorities they have for themselves and their family, and they're going to obey the Old Testament and the Law of Moses.

Unknown Speaker  04:45
The Old Testament law. It held that every Jewish adult male who lived in Israel was acquired three times a year to attend at least one of the feast. Maybe it was the festival of Passover, the festival of Pinnock. cost or the festival of Tabernacles. They didn't have to go to all three of them they could, but at least one was required. But it was not required that your family go along with you. But Joseph was bringing his family with him. Every year says the parents wins. I love that. No matter the distance, no matter the travel, no matter who is going to be there, no matter what friends they could meet up with, no matter how large, no matter how small, no matter how medium, they were going to be there that says, according to their custom, if you take a look back, it's a few verses prior. Look at verse 2223, and 24 with me. It says, Now when the days of purification, according to the law of Moses, work completed, there they are, again, following the law of Moses, they brought him to Jerusalem to present him to the Lord, as it is written into law of the Lord, every male who opens the womb shall be called holy to the Lord to verse 24, and to offer a sacrifice according to what is said in the law of the Lord, a pair of turtle doves and two young pigeons, within a verse 39. So when they had performed all the things, according to the law of the Lord, they returned to Galilee to their own city, Nazareth. That's it. Mary and Josue were devoted to the law of Moses to the commandments of the Lord. By all accounts, they loved it, by all accounts, they studied it, by all accounts they owe bade it and that is key. They made this a habitual part of who they are. I want to say we don't have kids just yet, we're still in that 10 year plan, right? But the first secrets in a successful home, or a successful life, is that spiritual priorities dominates. So I wonder, with the law of Christ, do the same people that I know or that around me friends or even Christians, acquaintances, when it comes to the love of Christ, and they have the same confidence in me that spiritual priorities dominates. I remember when I was, I guess, about 14 or 15, we had a really close group of guy friends, man, we love sports. Any chance we got in the summer, we're shooting hopes in the fall. We're throwing football passes. We love that we breathe sports, breathe basketball, breathe football. One of my buddies was a huge football fan. I think he played football since he was like three years old. I mean, just generation after generation. They were football fanatics. And they were from a big football state before they moved to Texas. I remember this particular football season, their team made it to the Super Bowl. It's been years since I've made the playoffs. Now they're here they are in the big dance. So I asked them, hey, what do you guys doing for the Super Bowl? I mean, your team is on there. You had posters of him. Your YMCA football name was after them? What are you guys doing? They simply said we're going to worship. And I wasn't a Christian are really raised in a Christian atmosphere as I was kind of like baffled what but your football team is playing in the Super Bowl. What are you guys doing for that? Again, we're going to worship as a young teenager. I mean, that spoke volumes of their spiritual priorities. And again, maybe we get home in time we can catch the fourth quarter of the game. But either way, we're going to seek and serve our God. And that's exactly it's with Mary and Joseph it funneled in to their children. Again, look at verse 43, and 44 with me.

Unknown Speaker  09:23
It says when they had finished the days as they returned, the boy Jesus lingered behind in Jerusalem, and Joseph and his mother did not know it. But supposing him to have been in the company, they went a day's journey and saw some among their relatives and acquaintances. He wasn't there. He was somebody I'll just think about that for a second. It'd be like you traveling from Nashville to Indianapolis, going back from Indianapolis back to Nashville and realizing our kid is not with us. But it's worse for them. They were probably walking or To share it t in all the way up there in verse 49. And he said to them, Why did you seek me? Did you not know that I must be about my Father's business? I love that mom and dad. That's how you raised me, mom and dad. That's what you taught me, mom and dad. That's what you instilled the values. And I'm 12 years old. Again, we know the parents were stressed and anxious about this whole situation. I mean, after all, you just misplace the Messiah. But maybe in this moments, maybe there was just this temporary grin of comforts, a grin of internal joy that comes from knowing that you raised your kid up, right? That's huge. A lot of parents here tonight's parents, are the people who had the greatest influence on their children's hearts, just as Mary and Joseph did with their son. Again, the Gospel says very openly that Mary and Joseph did not understand their sons reply, which is probably the most case with teenage or close a teenage kids. But in this instance, their son got it writes, attending Florida College. I mean, there are sound groups all over I mean, churches inside of churches, I mean, gospel teaching gospel preaching congregation, just saturate the area of Temple terrace, Florida. And there are some kids who just make their parents hearts glad when they know they're away from the nest. And they're finding a faithful group to serve and to worship with. That makes their parts glad. How much more when we go to worship as God's children? How much more comfort that give our Father in heaven? Second one, I'm gonna just asking them questions. And look, this is the boy Jesus at age 12, that we're gonna put them what's in sixth grade, possibly. Again, the sixth grade boy right here is standing in the temple among the teachers, listening to them and asking them questions. I'm not sure exactly who would have been included right here, these teachers perhaps described, perhaps the Pharisees, perhaps these religious authorities or temple leaders, but you just have to sit back and admire the confidence and just a proactiveness of this 12 year old. Let's face it. When I was in sixth grade, I was discovering the joys of Nintendo, and real competitive sports. And girls. But Jesus was asking these men questions, and he was listening to them. What is that? A 12 You have this eager students wanting to be around the wise this the most intellectual, those who are talking about religious matters, and get this all those who are surrounded by him around him. were amazed at his understanding. If anyone didn't need to inquire if anyone didn't need the patience to sit and listen, or to the stern, or kind of way, the wisdom of all these teachers, there was no one who needed help more of understanding. It would be Jesus wouldn't it's even at age 12. After all, he is the Son of God. He is the God who came among us to dwells in the beginning was the word in the Word was with God and the Word was God.

Unknown Speaker  14:17
And yet he was the learning. He was going to capitalize and soak up the knowledge from those around him. Again, the text says they found Him in the temple, sitting among the teachers, listening to them and asking them questions. I love it. Because right there, that sentence kind of just has about the relationship between teachers and students. And we can learn so much right there from this boy, Jesus, one. He's seeking out teachers. He's seeking out wisdom. He's seeking out those who know the Word of God and sat in their mitts. care. But he was also listening. He was seeking, but then he was listening. And he was engaged, right, this active listener when he asked them questions. And then he gave answers. It's like the perfect Baba class, right? He's sitting amongst teachers, he's listening to him, I got an answer for that. And it all worked really well. He's 12 years old, that by age 32, I still struggle, some of those things, being active in Bible class, seeking wisdom from other men, or maybe women who have been through that, and experienced it's, and then just to listen, about, I'd be quiet for a couple of seconds and listen to the wisdom that they are given me. But then wrangling with all that's Terbinafine, how does that work? What does that look like? How can I be that? How did you practice it? How did you get through that? And Christ was doing them. I mean lesson for our kiddos. So I'll say this, it is never too early to start. But you could always starts. Every year, I get the opportunity to attend a workshop in Dallas, Texas. They dubbed it the young preachers workshop, a few established preachers kind of create this two day forum with all these kind of nuts and bolts, practical stuff, and trying to pay it forward to all these young evangelists. So we can get out there and do the work of ministers, sometimes an elder, maybe this two day forum, and they'll give a couple of lessons of some insights. And I jokingly told the elder, it would be great that there was a young elders workshop, just to get men ready for that to serve to minister to help to encourage to be these future leaders of God's church. So I asked them, there's no elders workshop. How do you how do you get ready for that? How can I prepare for that? He says, easy there buckaroo, buts, is a really good text feature to Ezra chapter seven. In verse 10. I want you to go home and read this. And so I did as read chapter seven. And verse 10. It says, For Ezra had prepared his heart to seek the law of the Lord. And to do its, and to teach statutes and ordinances in Israel. That's it, right? seek God's law, live God's law, and then teach God's law. I see all of that starting right here with his 12 year old boy. This is the climax of law really. My father's house, going back to our original texts, let's pick up in verse 40, eights. So when they saw him, they were amazed. And his mother said to him, Son, why have You done this to us? Look, your father and I have sought you anxiously. And he said to them, Why did you seek me? Did you not know that I must be about my Father's business, or in my father's house. But they did not understand the statement in which he spoke to them. I mean, there were certain rights. When they say in this kind of caravan type of situation, it'd be 30 to 40 of your relatives. So it kind of be easy to maybe misplace something if you're not just cautiously looking for them. But here they are searching and searching. So it's no surprise that Mary the mother right here is kind of like in this panic mode. Where's Jesus? Where do we leave them? Is he over here in this chariot? Is he over there? Where did he go?

Unknown Speaker  19:12
With great anxiety they, they looked for their kid. They wanted to find their child. Listen, the question. Where did they search? They searched the playground. They searched Bethlehem sports and outdoors. The Jerusalem candy shop. The Nazarene bakery, the athletic store down the street, the clothing store down the road. No, they found their son at the temple. Three days later, the one who has lost has now been found. I kind of love Mary's loving rebuke right here. And she was astonished. She said, Where have you been? Why do you do this to us? And then Christ says You shouldn't have to search at all. I'm going to be where my father is. That's a huge statement. I mean, Jesus is telling Mary, she should have known where he was. It is as if he's saying, Do you remember the night the angel told you I would be the Son of God? Or do you remember that night in Bethlehem, angels praising God, shepherds are glorifying God? Are you remember the wise men coming over and giving you gifts all the way from the east? Or do you remember Joseph dream about escaping avoiding Egypt, and getting back home? I mean, Mom, where else would I be? You seen the dreams. God spoken to you and Joseph, you know all of this. But no gospel scene shows more clearly. The gradual process by which he grew Jesus, into a sense of his mission. And again, you kind of notice that subtle contrasts his parents, Behold, your father and I have been looking for you, Jesus, I was with my father. No, your father and I have been looking for you know, Mom, you're not getting it. I was with my father. I mean, that's a crucial step. For any son, or any daughter, really, for any dis future disciple, that Jesus, in this crucial stage in his life, on the brink of Jewish manhood in his culture, he tells his parents in an unforgettable way that he knows who his real father is. See, I think the stories are Korean about this 12 year old because in the Jewish culture, the age of 12, was very significance. The 12th year was the final year of preparation for a boy before entering fully into the religious life of the synagogue. Till then parents, especially the father, or teaching them to obey the commandments of the law. And so at the end of his 12 year, he goes through a ceremony in which he becomes a Bar Mitzvah. In other words, before he becomes a son of the commandments. So Jesus was demonstrating for those who had the eyes to see that he would be more than just an average ordinary Jewish Bar Mitzvah. He was going to be the son of the commandments, the son of commandments. But again, parents, I think one of the best things that you can give your children is a life. That's dependence on God. Look how it all wraps up. In verse 52, it says, And Jesus, increased in wisdom and stature, in favor with God. And men. I mean, kind of what do you see there? I think wisdom is kind of part of that mental aspects rights than the stature there are healthiest a physical part of its than favor with God, you have the spiritual side of things and favor with men against social. So in all that right there Christ was growing up mentally, physically, spiritually, and socially. That's true, really, for successful life. People who advance in all those categories mentally, physically, spiritually, and socially. That's where we want to get people and our kids.

Unknown Speaker  24:03
We want to see all those traits. And probably all your children who are here tonight, we want to see them develop in each and every category. Sometimes we kind of emphasize more than the other. There's a need for the physical or social growth. We might take them to a doctor or to a counselor, just to make sure they're caught up in those areas. But what about the two most important parts? The wisdom and favor with God? What are we doing there? Again, Mary and Joseph. They're gonna teach him all of that. Really good stuff. And this texts right here. I'll ask you one more question. What's unique about this story? You're thinking Well, Matt, this is the only time this narrative is found in all four Gospels. Well, you'd be right. But it's something else. You're thinking, Okay, this is the only story that we have a crisis adolescence. You'd be right. But it's something else. If you're thinking I got it. These are the first recorded public words spoken by Jesus. You'd be right. But it's something else. The story right here does not portray Jesus doing any supernatural deed, or speaking in some majestic, authoritative way. The story right here, let's face it, it shorts. It officience It's simple, and concise. There's no sign. There's no wonder there's no miracle. There's no deep theological narrative or some timeless piece of wisdom. With the story right here, we just read together, it reaches its climax, not in supernatural feats. But in one sentence, I must be about my Father's business. And really, that's the hearts of a disciple of a Christian of a saints. Have a kingdom citizen. So tonight's, where are you with that? What was 2017 for you? Are you truly seeking the Lord's house, the Lord's business, again, we're thinking here it is 2018 And just a short 24 hours. Now the resolutions will come reining in you don't have to wait for a certain dates, or month. You can make the change to nights, you can make the change when you need to make the change resolutions can start when you're ready for those. But again, what better way to kick off the new year than to be about your father's business. So tonight, if you want to pray together, open and study the Word of God. Or if you're ready to clothe yourself with the blood of Jesus, through baptism, calling on his name. Let's get that taken care of. Let's be ready for 2018 We're gonna help you in any way. Wish you'd come now. We stand to sing
