Good morning, it's good to see everyone here today, certainly good that we have an opportunity to be able to come here and worship our God, it's always a blessing when we can do that. So I appreciate the fact that you're, you're here with me to worship. You know, I look at houses very differently than my brother does. And my brother's a general contractor. So he'll walk into any building, really, and he's looking at the edges and the corners, and maybe norm you do some of this. And then an architect is looking at how it's built. And he's constantly like, well, they use this and they went, I just walk into a building, I don't even think about all those things, I might think about it a little bit, or I did think about it, when I was buying a house, I probably had a little extra effort, so to look and see that everything was in its proper place was in its proper order. And so you have to get someone to come in and give you a an appraisal of everything to make sure that it's in working order. You know, buildings are just something that we use, and we don't often think about their structure, how they're, they're made. But but every house is built, and every house is is made. And we understand that in a physical sense. When we open up the scriptures, particularly the First Peter chapter two, we see that that the church and Christians are described as a building. So I'd like to talk for just a few moments this morning about a spiritual house, a spiritual house. Gil has been doing an excellent job taking us through First Peter, and we'll head into Second Peter. And so I'd like to look at a passage there from First Peter chapter two and verse four, starting in verse four. So one of the first things we see about this spiritual house is that it has a foundation of Jesus Christ, a foundation of Jesus Christ, every building needs a foundation, it doesn't have a foundation, you're in trouble. In fact, when we were buying our last house, one of the things that that concern some people is that there seemed to be a buckle in one of the walls. And so there was a concern about the foundation. And so the appraisers came out and looked at that, if you do not have a good foundation, when you're trying to sell a house, it's a huge red flag. That is foundational, it is important, it's extremely needed. A house with a faulty foundation is no good. And that's what we see about this spiritual houses that there is no faulty foundation, there is a strong and steadfast Foundation, and it is found in Jesus Christ. In first Corinthians chapter three and verse 11, we see this imagery used elsewhere, when it says, For no one can lay a foundation other than that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ. When we talk about the foundation of the church and of Christians, we see that Jesus is that foundation, there is no other, there is no other. And so we see the importance of who Jesus is for our lives. If you take out the foundation, there is no basis for our lives and for what we do. Going back to First Peter chapter two and verse four. Notice he continues, this imagery says, As you come to him, a living stone, rejected by men, in the sight of God, chosen and precious, as you come to him, speaking of Jesus Christ, and it describes Jesus as a living stone, a living stone, it's going to go on to talk about this stone as being the the stone in Zion, the cornerstone, chosen, and precious, it is the cornerstone that others have rejected. When we think about stones, bricks, stones, those are not things that we normally think of as being animate or alive. Those are inanimate objects. It's simply a stone we don't think about it being alive or dead. It has no life. But this stone it says, is a living stone, a living stone,

Jeremy Sweets  04:23
this stone, this foundation, Jesus Christ is living, active, He is powerful, and able to give life himself. Jesus is the Living Stone based upon the resurrection from the dead. He is alive. Romans four one in verse four, it says that he is declared to be the Son of God in power, according to the spirit of holiness by His resurrection from the dead. When Jesus raised from the dead, we see a declaration that went out that he is truly the Son of God. He is powerful. And a we also can't help but be reminded of Peter's confession in Matthew chapter 16. When Jesus asked his disciples who do people say that I am. And there are many responses that came back. But Peter stepped up and said, You are the Christ, the Son of the living God. And Jesus said to Peter, that upon this rock, this statement of faith, this statement of fact, that Jesus is the Christ, I will build my church. And so Jesus is the foundation. He is the rock, the bedrock that we see here. But when we talk about this rock, we'll notice that it's not a rock that's been accepted by everybody. In fact, it was a rejected rock, or rejected stone that was for the building. Normally, when they were building, when they were building structures, particularly in the first century, they would have cut stones that would have been appropriate to be placed together. In fact, you look at some of the the temples here, the structures that it looks like they were cut with machines, and they didn't have quite that technology in the first century. But they were cut so that they could be fit exactly where they needed to be fit together. Well, when it comes to this stone, many of the builders there are many of those that were ready to use this stone rejected it. This stone, is it appropriate, it isn't cut, right. And that would have been a common process. As you were looking at these stones that were used for building, they would cut a stone and if it wasn't appropriate, it wasn't fit just right, they would reject it, and push it out to the side. Well, that's what they did with Jesus Christ. They rejected him. He was not appropriate. I don't do a lot of woodworking but the first time I went to Lowe's, I had a little project and I just picked up some some boards, well, I learned pretty quickly that you need to inspect those boards, you need to inspect a two by four. And so next time I looked like a quasi professionally, I saw these people picking them up, I got their eye to them. And so I learned to do that. Because you want a straight board that's appropriate for us. And so it is with the cut stone, Jesus Christ the living stone. He was rejected and tossed aside by many. But the text says that he is precious and chosen by God. Jesus saw what other people could not or God saw in Jesus what other people could not see. God, the chief architect chose him and considers him to be precious, he is just right. He fits the bill. We also see that as a living stone, Jesus has the power to give life. When we come to this stone, there's two approaches that we have, we can either accept or reject Jesus as the cornerstone to those that believe it says The honor is for you, and they will not be put to shame. But to those who do not believe it is a stone of stumbling and a rock of offense. Jesus Christ is the foundation the chief cornerstone of this spiritual house.

Jeremy Sweets  08:36
But as we move on, we see that Christians are also living stones and I think that's no accident. If we go back to verse four, it says as you come to Him, Jesus, a living stone rejected by men, but in the sight of God chosen and precious. You yourselves like living stones are being built up to a spiritual house. You'll notice that the description of Jesus as a living stone is the same description that we have. We too are living stones, and that's no accident. We are to be like our Savior. We are to imitate our Savior, we are to look like him. We are not only built upon him as a chief cornerstone, meaning that if you take him out, we have no foundation. He supports us and we are dependent upon him. Not only that, but we are also to be like him. We also are living stones. We are living just as God or just as God raised Jesus from the dead. God raises us up in baptism as we are raised to walk in newness of life. Just as Jesus rose from the dead one day we too will rise from the dead. Not only do we imitate Hamad being a living stone like he is, but we're really going to imitate his rejection by men. Just as he was rejected, we too will be rejected, will be cast aside and seen as outdated and unworthy of the culture today, we're simply out of out of step. And so we see that people will reject us if we choose to follow after Him today. But not everyone will reject us, just as God chose Jesus, and saw him to be precious, even though all people may reject us today, we can find comfort in the fact that we can be pleasing to God. And that's the most important choice to be made, isn't it, that God would find us to be pleasing. In verses nine and 10 of this passage, it says that you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, it goes on to say people for His own possession, once you are not a people, but now you are God's people. The fact is, is that we can be chosen and pleasing to God and that is our utmost goal and aim, even if everyone in the world is disappointed with us, we can be pleasing to God. And that is our goal. We can be pleasing to God by being a holy people and appreciate the songs that were led this morning that that points us to holiness. If we're to be living stones, if we are to have any influence and power within ourselves, it is to come through our holiness, our holiness. In verse five, it says that we are a holy priesthood and here the imagery changes slightly as he talks not only are we living stones, and we make up the spiritual house, but we are also the inhabitants of the house we are the servants within the house, we are the priests. We see here the the temple imagery will the priests are to be there serving and working. And Christians are a holy priests to their lives are to be marked by holiness and godliness. A temple that is filled with with sin, and with degradation is not a functional working temple. It is not doing what it is made or designed to do. God is a holy God and he cannot dwell in a place of sin. And so we see the extreme and vital importance of holiness to be a holy people. Well, as we mentioned, the collection here the spiritual house is a temple. And the church is a temple. You know, individual stones find their full potential and strength when they are built together as a spiritual house. God loves each individual stone that goes into that building, we can have a relationship with Him, He gave his lies for us, but individual stones find their full potential when they are together. I can't help but think of I have kids, I can't help but think of Legos. When you start stacking those Legos and make them into dependent upon interlocking upon one another, they become stronger.

Jeremy Sweets  13:35
That's a hard lesson. When you're first building Legos, you just stack them straight up and my kids are like, Why do they fall down? It's like, well, you need to interlock the well that's what we are in the church as living stones we are in are locked together, we are interdependent upon one another. While God loves individual stones. He has made the church to be a temple of Christians that are built together. And Ephesians two and verse 19. It says so then you are no longer strangers and aliens, but you are fellow citizens with the saints and members of the household of God. We are Christians together and God has intended that we would be Christians together. It's not a matter of isolation. Paul also reminds the Corinthians that that it's not the construction worker that is of primary importance, but it's it's the building as we think about the fact that the gospel is to go out and it requires many workers that are preaching and proclaiming the gospel. Paul says there in First Corinthians it's really not the worker that should receive the the primary importance, but it is the building it is what is being built up in First Corinthians three in verse 16. He says Do you not know that you are God's temple, and that God's Spirit dwells? holes in you. And so it is of the church. The church is a temple. It is a temple. In the Old Testament, a temple was vital, it was needed in order to worship temple, the temple in Jerusalem was the place where they would go to worship and they would not go anywhere else. In fact, there was a question that was put to Jesus in John Chapter Four about where they should worship. The Jews worshiped in the temple at Jerusalem, but the the Samaritans worshiped on mountain garrison and they did not go to Jerusalem. And so the Samaritan woman and John for asked Jesus, sir, I perceive that you are a prophet, our father's wash worshipped on this mountain. But you say that in Jerusalem is the place where you aren't ought to worship. And Jesus answers are in John form, verse 21. Woman believe me the hour is coming when neither on this mountain nor in Jerusalem, will you worship the Father, you worship what you do not know. We worship what we know for salvation is from the Jews. But the hour is coming in is now here, when the true worshipers will worship the Father and spirit and truth. For the Father is seeking such people to worship him, Goddess spirits, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit, and truth. Notice that the Jews traditionally worshiped in Jerusalem and the temple. It was the the representation, it was the dwelling place of God, but Christians, and Jesus announces this the time is now here as he has come. But Christians are not required to worship in the temple in Jerusalem. Christians are the temple. And so anytime Christians come together, anytime we come together, as a group, we are the temple, and we can worship as the temple. We don't have to be in Jerusalem to worship God, we can come here and be a temple of God. And that's a beautiful picture, isn't it? We can be the temple of God in which we offer of worship to Him. And as a temple, we are a dwelling place for him. God is in our midst. And we can proclaim and announce his excellencies God dwelled in the tabernacle in the testament, and the temple in the Old Testament. And his presence was there in a very special way. And so it is in the church. We are the temple, and God's Spirit dwells in us. And Ephesians two in verse 19, he says that you are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus Himself being the cornerstone, in whom the whole structure being joined together, grows into a holy temple in the Lord. And Him you also are being built together into a dwelling place for God, by the spirits, I see the beauty of being joined together, and being more more effective and beneficial as we come together. And in that we can be the temple of God.

Jeremy Sweets  18:20
So the church is a temple that tells me a little bit about its its function or its role. We are to be a people, as we come together that worships and praises God that offers up sacrifices, there is a purpose to this temple. And that purpose is to give glory to God, to give glory to God. And that's really a general statement for what I see is very, two very specific purposes in in the text. The first one is that we offer up spiritual sacrifices or spiritual worship, sacrifices or offerings that go up from from man to God and the Old Testament. They involve the sacrifice of an animal and the smoke, it talks about what would ascend up to heaven, and a whole burn offering as it was Bernie would ascend up to to God? Well, that's what we have in the temple as we offer up spiritual worship. We are all priests, as we offer worship to God, when we protect the Lord suffer our thoughts and our remembrances are given to God. And they serve as a Sacher and they serve as a remembrance of the sacrifice of His Son. And so we all partake of that memorial meal. It's not just a few, it's not the clergy. It's not just the preacher, the elders that partake of that meal. We all do that, as we all as priests offer up sacrifice of remembrance. When we pray together, one person traditionally leads the prayers speaks the prayer, but we all pray together. And so we lift up our voice in praise of his name, we talk directly to him. And we do that as a group. And we offer up words of praise and thanksgiving, and we rely upon him with our art requests. And so we offer up the spirits of praise. When we sing, we sing to one another, but we make melody to the Lord with our heart. And we give thanks always, and for everything to God, the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, Ephesians, 519 and 20. And so our song together is a matter of worship that ascends up to God, we all as priest sing together. Again, it's not a choir, it's not a select few that do the singing. We all sing together, because we are all priests and offer up our worship. When we preach, teach and encourage one another with God's word, we use our mouths to consider his goodness, as revealed in Scripture. And so Gil led us in a study this morning at First Peter, as we consider the words of First Peter, and I'm trying to, again, bring us bring our attention to the Scripture, as we all as Christians are encouraged by those words, and continue to grow in our faith. And so the first purpose I see in this spiritual houses, as we are holy priests, is to offer up worship to God's sacrifice. And Hebrews 13, in verse 15, says through him, then let us continually offer up a sacrifice of praise to God, that is the fruit of lips that acknowledge his name. Hebrews 13 says that when we offer up the fruit of our lives, words and statements of praise, then that is a sacrifice that goes up to God. And so we offer up those words of praise and our thoughts of the Lord's Supper, when we pray, when we seen when we teach and preach God's were. And so spiritual worship is one of the first aspects that I see here. The second one, though, is a proclamation not just to Christians that are here, but a proclamation to those that do not know God. Notice in verse nine, there says that you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation of people for His own possession, that you may proclaim the excellencies of Him who called you out of darkness into His marvelous light. Those first word pictures and images all talk about the fact that we are chosen. Just as in the Old Testament, the Jews were a chosen race. Today, Christians are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a select group of individuals, we are a holy nation, the people of God. It also says that we have been,

Jeremy Sweets  23:14
we are people of his own possession. We are owned by God, we are set apart and set aside. But God's goal is not to restrict his blessings. God's goal is that he would use us for the purpose of proclaiming to others so that they also might become children of God, so that they also might become people of a chosen race. And so that tells us that this is not a physical race that we're talking about. The gospel is not restricted to a single race of people. But it's really for all who will accept the message, isn't it? And so we call out to all people saying, Come and be a part of this, come in no the excellencies of God. And so we make proclamation. We remind ourselves of the teaching, but we also have an important function or role as the church, and that is to tell the message to other people. In Colossians one and verse 13, it says that He has delivered us from the domain of darkness and transfer Firdous to the kingdom of his beloved Son, in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins. I thought that imagery plays well with what we see in First Peter chapter two. What is accomplished when we come to Christ is that we are transformed, furred from this domain of dark serving Satan, and the works of sin and darkness, and we are transferred to a kingdom of light. If you go back to First Peter chapter two and you see in verse nine, that we proclaim the excellencies of whom who called you out of darkness into His marvelous light. Lights. That's what we announce and proclaim you do not have to remain in darkness, to stay in darkness. God wants you to be a part of the chosen race. God wants you to be the royal priesthood, the holy nation and people of his own possession. It is open and available for for all, for any that would accept. And these things I hope we see both of these, the spiritual worship and the proclamation of God is to be to the glory of God, to his announcing of His greatness, so that we might glorify Him, the goal is that we would proclaim him but not only that, but live honorable lives and godly lives so that others might proclaim His excellencies as well. And as it says in verse 12, we might see our good deeds and glorify God on the day of visitation. The goal that we have as the temple, the church, as living stones, is that others might acknowledge Him, that God might be glorified, that he might be magnified that others might see his greatness and His Granger. And so that's a big responsibility isn't, we are the temple, we are the messengers, we are the ones that point to the message found in God, so that we might be to the glory of God. Let me let me close with a few lessons as we consider some things that we can learn from this spiritual house. First of all, we need to make Jesus our foundation, we need to make Jesus our foundation. Any other foundation will not do will be like those on building a foundation have seen, Jesus Christ is the rock. And so we need to look to him to model our lives after him, to make him the main point of our message to point to him as our foundation, and we need to rely upon him. And we can't go elsewhere. We need to make Jesus our foundation,

Jeremy Sweets  27:22
we also need to be the church. Now, I know that we are reminded at this time that we are citizens of the United States. And there's a lot of discussion about voting and things like that. And you may exercise your civic duty in those regards. But never forget that you are the church. First and foremost, you are the church. And that is ahead of any other relationship that you would have. Yes, we are citizens of the United States, but we are the church. And that should be the primary motivator and mover in all that we do. We may even align ourselves with some other organization or things like that there are many organizations in our country that seek to do good things that may be fine, but of primary importance, is the fact that we are the church. And so that should guide our actions that should guide our thoughts and beliefs. You know, a lot of organizations out there come with their own set of beliefs. Well, the church is our is our primary identity. And it establishes our beliefs and our practices. And so any other organization pales in comparison to what we are to be as the church. It is the filter by which we evaluate everything else. And do not think that that being a being the church is ineffective. There's a lot of good that can be done in this world. A lot of organizations are vying for our attention and our time and and promoting some good messages. But being the church is our primary focus, and that is not ineffective. If you are the church and nothing else, you're doing a good thing. So be the church, as the church let us worship God. We need to be continually renewed and reminded, and in worship, that sets the direction for our life we can most readily be the church when we are filled with praise for God, when we acknowledge his greatness, when we look at the problems in the world, but we look up to God and see that he is the answer and he is the solution. So worship, and I hope we recognize this particularly this time because it's been a little off kilter, we've not been able to have the regular schedule that we wanted. We had to take a little bit of time off and even now we're Not all together as the church. But I think that helps remind me that it is so vitally important that we do worship together. It shapes our hearts and our minds. And it creates the kind of person that we need to be. We need to be a worshiping people focused upon God. Let us live godly lives, holy lives, as we talked about, we need to be pure and holy, as the temple of God, we are to be the dwelling place of God. And that requires that we would push sin out of our midst. And that is a constant struggle and strain, but one that we can never give up on. We can never allow sin to reside in the temple. It is damaging, and God will reject that kind of Temple. And so we must live godly lives, we have to encourage one another. We have to be strengthened in God's Word. We have to pray for forgiveness and put those things behind us and keep marching forward so that we can live godly lives. I'm not sure there's ever a time when we'll live this life and say that temptation has no effect on me. I'm not tempted by anything, Satan will not give up. As long as we're alive, he is going to be gunning for us. But we need to remember who we are. We are the people of God, the church of God, and we are to be a holy priesthood. Not only should we live godly lives, but we should proclaim Him to others. Knowing God is the greatest thing that we can have in this life, this world is hurting, full of pain. And we see that in many areas in many ways. And the answer to the solution to the world's problems is found in God. It's found in Jesus Christ. And we need to announce that and proclaim that unashamedly to tell others about the goodness to be found in him, the excellencies of, of of him of his marvelous light, darkness pales in comparison. And it can offer no such no such satisfaction or true joy in life that can only be found in God.

Jeremy Sweets  32:19
