Unknown Speaker  00:00
It is my honor to be able to be with you. We've had a relationship for a long time. And if you do not know how much gratitude I have in my heart for this flock, and for those of you that reach out to us and pray for us on a regular basis that is so comforting, and to be able to see that you're interested in holding up our hands, and the work there, not only in Gainesville, where we've been for the last six years, but the previous 11 years where we were in in Charleston, where we started from scratch and the Lord bless the work there. And it still is flourishing, where we have left behind those that are willing to work. And so things are going well, the church now where we are at was contacting me about six years ago, to see if I would come and help them to recover, there was a series of events where people would have moved, were moved in and caused a lot of damage to the flock. And thus, they went from like 150, down to 10. And so because of those that caused so much damage, and so we moved there, I asked another individual if he would come and help and so the Lord is blessing the work it is growing there, just about weekly, we are having new people, because there is peace and harmony in the flock, we, myself and I, the other fella and three of us serve as shepherds and we have prevented a number of those trouble Ling people from coming back to cause further damage. And so because there is peace that is raining people are getting comfortable with coming back and, and and also checking us out. And so we are, we are being very blessed from that standpoint. And we thank you for your part in that. And we are excited to see the fruit that is coming to you. And that you are growing as well, because of the leadership here. And your participation in proclaiming God's word God is certainly going to bless those efforts. And thank you for your encouragement, please do read our reports from month to month. And if you ever see a photograph on it, you'll know that there is someone else that has obeyed the gospel and and whenever you see that you can go and rejoice with us over the Lord bringing the increase. Take your Bibles, turn to John chapter six, John six is where we are focused in this series. And I hope and pray that the Lord will bless us in this effort, John chapter six. Would you Would you agree with me if I said we live in a time where there are a lot of passions running wild? Yes, everywhere you look at every broadcast, media, Facebook, you name it, you see people running wild with some of their passions, but most of them are based upon shallow and seldom any kind of deep facts associated with those sad passions that they are exhibiting. They are not giving much thought to the repercussions that will come from such activities that they are considering and that they're so passionate about. And the world will continue.

Unknown Speaker  03:49
We cannot change the world, the world will do things that is the god of this world as a whole have a lot of people. And the only avenue we have to help change things is for people to listen to the message of the gospel. Well, unfortunately, and I'm now trying to wean myself off of any kind of connection with such media outlets. But I see an alarming number. And I hear about alarming number of brethren also that have a relationship with God. They also are involved with some some of these passions and not considering the eternal consequences of those things. And of course, we need to always remember that whenever we study God's Word, we need to allow God to have a deep impact on our heart through his work. And this has always been the case it's nothing new. And it will always be this case till the end of time or we breathe our last breath. It will always be this case is, in John chapter six, we see a number of events taking place, I'm not going to cover the whole chapter so you can rest, I do want to touch on some of the things that apply to this theme that we're looking at. He feeds 1000s of people with five loaves and two fishes, and, and so probably every child here has already studied and know that story. Well, they the people like this, they are so excited about it. Matter of fact, they try to move and to force him to be a king. Well, Jesus is not going to have any part of that kind of behavior, he withdraws himself up onto a mountain to pray. And there is time passes. Finally the disciples, they get in the boat, and they go back to the other side of the lake, things happen in the middle of the lake, I'm on live, leave that to you to look at. But the next day, the next day, they find Jesus over on the other side of the Sea of Galilee. And they this is where we will pick up verse starting with verse 25, verse 25, they see him over on the other side. And when they find him, they say, well, Rabbi, how did you? How did you come here, and those of you that know this story, he walked part of the way and, and was in the boat the other part of the way, Jesus answered them. Truly, truly, I say to you, you are seeking Me, not because you saw the signs. But because you ate the lows and we're failed, or your transformation may save you are filled with lows. He says, do not work for the food which perishes, but for the food that endures to eternal life, which the Son of Man will give to you. For only him, The Father has set His seal. And they said to him, What must we do? To be doing the works of God, they got that much out of his statement so far. And Jesus said, Well, this is the work of God that you believe in Him whom He has sent. And so he answers their question. But what he's doing there to begin with, he is calling upon them to examine your motives. Why are you seeking me? What is your motivation here? And he wants them to understand, are you seeking temporary, or eternal blessings? Are you seeking after physical things that perish are eternal things that do not perish? And so he's wanting them to, to understand there is a bigger thing happening here, then you just getting free food, the whole society today, if it's free, it's for me. And so he's tapping in to their hunger for physical food, and is trying to change their thinking from physical carnal to spiritual?

Unknown Speaker  08:15
Well, he wants them to examine themselves. And the answer is here exactly how this work that that God wants them to do is to be done through belief, through belief. Now, you might say, well, well done. Yes. But do you really know the depth of that word is used many times in the New Testament, St. John 316, that we know and, and many other places, and it is a remarkable word, but there's a commitment associated with this matter of fact, has the idea of to be all in, I am thoroughly convinced, I am completely committed to that's the idea of what Jesus is saying, We must be thoroughly committed, and in the game here, and is all or nothing if that's what he's asking them to do. Very few people in the world, when they use the word belief, are talking about that kind of belief. But that's what the word there is understanding for us to understand. Cross uses this desire for physical food, to point out to them that I am the bread of life. I am the living bread that has come and thus you must is going to say some things that will really upset them and cause them to be confused and actually some events as taken from this. But most of these people would have been Jews and because they are Jews, they would have been have a working knowledge of God's word, hearing it every weekend. setting it as they did. And so he quotes to them some verses and John chapter six and verse 44. Now, he tells them about answering this question trying to get them to examine their motives to sort this out. He says, nobody can come to Me unless the Father who sent Me draws him. And I will raise him up in the last day. Now, I want you to notice two things here, who is drawing? And who are they learning from? It is written in the prophets, they must all be taught by God. Therefore everyone has heard and learned from the father. But yeah, Rick, it says, exactly. That's right. But are we getting it? When we read God's word? are we hearing God? Are you hearing Ricky, are you hearing, you know, the one that preaches hear from day to day or teaches a class is, are we just hearing John John told us in? Who are we hearing? Here, Jesus is bringing out here that we've got to hear God, when we read and understand His Word, and verse 58, says, This rain came down, came down from heaven, not as your fathers ate manna, and our dad, He who eats this bread, will live for whatever that is, is saying, this is an ongoing, present, active consuming of this brand. Ongoing, active present, consuming of a relationship with God. This will be made clearer as we go forward. So let's pause for just a second and ask ourselves this question. What are we hungry from for? What do we hunger? What is our motivation that we're hungry for? There's a lot of allurements in our world today, and you do not have to look for to see these kind of churches that are alluring people, for example, with the health and well gospel, probably the most popular, the biggest churches around usually are those that that say, you know, they're promising health and promising well, and there's a lot of verses about that. Then there are those that are beautiful cathedrals and church buildings, and they walk into these edifices and they say, Oh, I can just feel God's presence here in this location.

Unknown Speaker  12:50
Then there are those individuals that were like me, when I was an early teenager, I would go to where the food was at who's got the best food, where's the best potluck, who's got the spaghetti supper, and so that that was something that was a motivation of mine when or as an early teenager, I was hungry, and but not for spiritual food, I was looking for the physical food. Then there are those kinds of churches that and draw people that will with sports and events and socials, and fun, fun, fun. The church closes to another place where I was at, I got one of their flyers that they were advertising and giving out in the community. And it was full color glossy page after page and you know, as you opened it up and folded it, and it was all about hiking, and mountain climbing and going rappelling and whitewater rafting and right here, right here in the bottom, bottom corner, Bible study. And so that was what their drawing card was, that was what they would knew that people wanted. And that's what they were given a lot of people involved with that kind of draw today in various churches, then there are those churches that are full of excitement. As you walk up to the building. You can hear the drums going and and you can hear the music playing and you walk in and everybody is standing up and and it's just full of excitement and and people break off into speaking something that they call tongues and and then and there is just that What benefit are they getting from this is an emotional cleansing again, physical carnal, emotional cleansing, and they they refer to that as the Holy Spirit moving them. Well then there are those individuals that you know I was born I and I'm going to die. It was just an institutional devotion allegiance to those things. And there's a lot of people millions and millions tie into that and then are drawn into that. And there's a new one today that is going on, which is kind of strange. But then there are the churches that are highly political. And you get in line with us and pressure these people to get in line with us. And that is their drawing card. We are out at a DA. And that's their drawing card. And this is not all there's a whole lot more of Rhett ways the devil has used to entice people to fill these church buildings up. And most of this is surface things superficial, certainly worldly. They're motivating church goers. How do you change somebody that is physically motivated carnally motivated to become spiritually motivated. But it's not easy. I think of Corinth, and you probably are familiar, this crowd here is kind of like the quiet choir. first four chapters of the book of Corinthians, First Corinthians, Paul is nailing this down. It seems as if God was really interested in blessing them, and kept Paul there for a long time, to teach the Word. And there was a lot of people that became Christians, the Holy Spirit was allowed to be given to a lot of people. However, when he wrote them, he heard of things going on, he said to him, and brethren, when I when I could not speak to you as spiritual people, but then as into Karnaugh, as intubating Christ I fed you with milk and not solid food, for until now you were not able to receive it and even now you're still not able or you are still carnal. But where there's envy and strife and divisions among you and calling themselves after Paul or after a pause or after receivers, he said are you not carnal and behaving like mere men?

Unknown Speaker  17:15
Hey, he let them have it and then go out go on into Chapter Four you see that he's it's very difficult to change somebody's motives from physical carnal motivation to be part of our with a group to spiritual because that is behaving like mere man. That's the reason so many people will look at churches as just a club is just like a club, meaning there's no difference. You might have to sign some kind of agreement or something. And so there's unfortunate that is occurring. And we have to ask ourselves, Am I one of those individuals? Let's explore more about that. Am I being Am I being drawn? Am I being motivated? Are? What I'm eager to know is what man teaches? What is being represented as what man would agree to? Are? Am I being motivated to want to listen to what God teaches? Now, think about it for a second. This means yes, this means no okay. Is the Bible and amazing book to show us how to use our money? Is means yes, this means no. Oh, yeah. So there. Now see the notton. Is the Bible also a book of history? Is the Bible a geography book? Yeah. Okay. Is the Bible full of scientific things? Yes, there's a lot of those. Is the Bible a master book of morals and uprightness? Yes. Is the Bible also a wonderful book on how to have wonderful families, respectable people in the community, and the families be orderly and well behaved.

Unknown Speaker  19:26
Is that all the Bible's good for? Is that why is that why we use the Bible? How much more time do we spend in God's word to accomplish and embrace those things? Which which are not wrong? I mean, they're there for us to learn and, and but if that is the extent of how we study God's word, it will not get us to heaven. Today, there's many, many churches that are devoted and spending a lot of time and energy in discussing these things. And the what ifs and whatnots. However God wants and desires to change us and mold us and make us into the image of Christ is our following some of those things part of it, yes. But underlying God changing us not man not made me deciding to just follow these guidelines because they're good for business good for our family. He wants to us to be born again. We're in John chapter three. We always associated that with being born of water and spirit, you know, being baptized now. Okay, we got wet now we're, we're okay. We're good. No, that phrase is used by the Lord to Nicodemus for a reason to let us know, he does not want us to just get dumped to get our sins taken away and possibly go to him. He's wanting to make us an infant, and build us back in his son's image. We've got to start all over. Okay, I'm erasing everything I've thought believed and accepted. And now I'm going to let God Himself through God's word make me shape me mold me into his will, is not tweaking is not just agreeing to certain things. It is a total start a restart. And so today, all of these energies, and gaining knowledge and applications and communications may not be effective at getting us to heaven, because he wants us to shine with his light. Matthew five in verse 16, you know it, they do not want to see a whole group of people that are very highly moral. God wants them to see, God. God do they say God, when they see me that one of the greatest compliments any of us, and I'm sure there's many here that has gotten this, someone come up and observing us over a period of time? Come on, you're a servant of God, aren't you? That's the greatest compliment anyone can ever get. To be able to someone recognized by by our behavior, our manner of life, that they're seeing God, not just a very good dad or a good servant, worker at XYZ business. God wants to be seen through us and say the problem here is a heart problem, a heart problem. Remember what Jesus said, Matthew, this sermon, is it. He says, where your heart is, excuse me where your treasure is, there will your heart be also. So what is a treasure? A treasure is a big investment in something. we've expended time we've expended money, we've expended effort, maybe we've expended a lot of pain, and in things, and the more we spend in that effort, the bigger treasure it is to us. And so where your treasure is, there will your heart be also.

Unknown Speaker  23:54
You remember when Jesus was talking to the Pharisees, this was the elite of his day, they were the scholars, mainly the scholars of their day. And as he was talking to them in Matthew chapter 15, he used the passages of Scripture that they knew very well, and we're aware of, he says, These people draw near to me with their mouth, Honor me with their lips, but their heart is far from me. And in vain they do worship me teaching his doctrines, the commandments of men. They knew exactly where that was to be found in Isaiah chapter 29. And it says almost word for word, except in the new New, New American Standard A ads and their reverence for me consist of traditions learned by rote learn from just, if you ever heard the story of who Why did they cut the end of the ham off? Yes, no. One, two, okay. Anybody over here? Okay. How many of us are just cutting in To him off, we're doing things because mama daddy, and she's doing things because her mama did it. And she's doing it because her mama did it. Where's God in that equation? We're doing things because our elders said it, or preacher, so and so sedate our because that's what we've always done. All of those are motivations of man. God said, that's not going to work. It didn't work for them, because they will tank that and tweak it and tweak it like they were doing it. Jesus just convicted them up. And actually, he really upset him. They were very much disturbed by what he had the way he treated them here. And rightly so because they were not in touch, or in sync with letting God be the one that's in charge. There are no grandchildren of God. Every one of us is a child of God's are, were not a child of God. There is no such thing as grandchildren, or great grandchildren and great great grandchildren. And it's just passed down and those are our authorities. We're all begin and being born again to be a child of God ourselves. And here's the line that has to be rearing us, they should all be taught of God by God. They should all be learned of the Father and so we've got to make certain that he's the one that is leading us to that second passage I want you to turn to is Second Timothy chapter three. Second Timothy, chapter three. This is a sobering passage. Disturbing actually, but understand this that in last days, verse one, there will come difficult times and People will be lovers of self, lovers of money, proud, haughty of you abusive, disobedient to parents. I'm grateful on holy, heartless on unappeasable slanderous, I'm reading from ESB slanderous, without self control, brutal, not loving, good, treacherous, reckless, swollen with conceit, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God having a form of godliness, but denying its power. So these people were practicing a form of godliness. For years, I always thought that that was describing worldly people, non Christians, those that are still in their sins never having to never been born in the kingdom of God. But it's talking about people practicing a form of godliness. Now, so this is talking about Christians. Is this disturbing is disturbing to me. I hope it is to you too, because I do not. Do you know some people that meets some of this criteria.

Unknown Speaker  28:55
I do. And it's not just those outside the kingdom of God is others. But okay, that aside, what does that last phrase mean? That is denying its power. Denying is power. What is that power? Well, we know this republic, Romans one in verse 16, popped in everybody's mind and there it is. I am not ashamed of the gospel for it is the power of God, to salvation to everyone who believes for the GU first and also the Greek. They're the same word where our English word dynamite came from that word power. So where and how do we tap into this power? Well, he explains that he says it right there. Every one who believes it when right after I became a Christian, I just really went to my siblings and I was Give them first here, verse here, mercy and mercy have mercy ever, and it was not doing anything. I'm thinking, why aren't they listening to this? This is important information. This is what life should be made up into, right over their head. Now 48 years of trying, and is still going where? Right over their head. Matter of fact, now I'm an annoyance to them because of my persistence in trying to get them to listen. There's no power if they don't believe it. And they're not willing to sit down and examine whether they believe it or not. So, so Deborah. But now my question here is, do we really believe remember a while ago when I said that word belief that Jesus said was, I'm all in, I'm involved, this is me, I am going full steam ahead. That is the belief that God is telling us to have. And so here is the question that sometimes people wonder, and it is often brought out a lot of debates over and that is what gives the God of the gospel, this power, it is belief. But did the Old Testament also have that same power as the New Testament? You ever thought about that? We always apply this to the New Testament, the gospel that God has brought it was that true the Old Testament as well? Well, the answer to that is yes. But they were treating it similar to what sometimes I have seen it traded today as well. And Romans one he talks about Gentiles and Romans two he talks about Jews and how they were treating the Word of God. He said that there's not it's not doing what you're supposed to do, because they were hypocritically judging, they were forgetting that they too are going to be receiving judgment one day, they were belittling God's patience with them. If you ever said, Man, I must be doing something right. And then you explain what kind of good thing just happened to you. And that must be God patting me on the back saying what a good boy you are. That's what they will do. And they were figuring out whether they were right or wrong based upon how things were turning out. And that is a normal thing that people come up with. And he continues his back in Job's day, even to our day as well. They, they said, Repent, well, that's for others to do not me. They said, I am hearing the Word of God, I'm there every time the word of God is read, I am doing what do you mean, I'm not doing what God wants me to do. And then the last one there is judging by externals. Now, ladies and gentlemen, brothers elders, every one of these need to be examined, there needs to be lessons on every one of these. Because what they were inflicted with is an ongoing continuous thing that happens to God's people over time. And so we should be very familiar and recognize the symptoms when we see these things happening. But I want us to just look at the very last verse, okay, we don't have time for all that. Tonight, that but the last verse here says, He that is a Jew is one inwardly and circumcision is that of the heart, and the spirit, not in the letter, whose praise is not from men, but from

Unknown Speaker  33:58
God. Who is it? That I'm trying to please myself? Or someone else say you're such a good boy, Ricky? Are Am I trying to get God? To look down at me? And say of me, like he said, of Joe, have you considered my servant? Is that my goal? Is that what we should be looking for? Yes, it is all about him and serving Him and doing what he wants us to be doing, not the idea of anything from this line. Now, here in this verse, There is a contrast that we don't consider very often. Spirit versus letter. How are those contrasting things? And this is not the only place Look in chapter seven and Romans. He's talking about that we've been told labored from the law, and it served its purpose if they were held by it, and now that we are to serve in newness of spirit, and not an old mess of the land, there's that contrast again, spirit versus letter. How do you contrast those things, they seem to be so very different. Well, we contrast those things by just knowing what the words mean. And so when you look at chapter seven, here, you see that contrast. Let's go to another. Here's the third one. In second Corinthians chapter three. You remember we said a minute ago, First Corinthians was letting them have it, he was spanking them with God's word. But luckily, they listened. And they heard it. And they started repenting. And they started changing so much. So that here when you get to the second letter, he says, You are our epistle written in our hearts, known and read by all man, clearly, you are an epistle of Christ, people can see Christ when they see you, because it's written all over you, ministered by us, written not with ink is not this that we're putting down here in ink. But it's written by the Spirit of the Living God. Not on tablets of stone, but on tablets of flesh, and the heart. So here you see a contrast between the idea of the Spirit and it were him working on the heart. And it's not just something in ink. number one bestseller in the world, the Bible always has been, always will be God, we'll see to that. But this is just paper in IE. There is no power in it. Until we believe it. And when we believe it, God himself makes this the living Word of God. And it will make a difference. This passage, if your turn there, you'll see when following right along. Now, verse four, he says, it says And We have such trust through cross toward God, not that we are sufficient of ourselves, to think anything. Think of anything as being from ourselves. This is not about us. Don't look at us. This is not about us. Our sufficiency is from God. And He has made us sufficient ministers of the New Covenant, not of the letter, there it is again, but of the Spirit. And then he says, we don't understand what he means by not of the letter this letter kills, but Spirit gives life. So what is this role of the Spirit? What how does the spirit involved involved in this? What role does he play? How is he part of this equation? Letter versus spirit? Let's think about that for a second question. When we hear the word of God years, we're getting it the answer when we hear the word of God. Do we hear God?

Unknown Speaker  38:36
I've heard many, many preachers gives Well, the apostle Paul that given time, Apostle, the apostle Paul sand in chapter and verse and, and, and so he was in a great, great triumph. And it's all about maybe what Paul is going through, and maybe where he is at and what kind of circumstances he is, then that's good information. But he is writing by inspiration. And so we need to understand this is God speaking through him about that. We're listening to God. And so if we cannot reverence that what is said in God's word, then we are actually doing great harm not only to ourselves, but all to also as we'll see in a minute to the Spirit of God. So there's been a lot of debates over this first question. I've set through them you've probably sat through them there through the years, this has happened a great deal. And they want to know here's here's the debate, the issue that they bring up so often can the Spirit work separate and apart from from the word? I would say to you, that's a faulty question. The whole question is wrong. The question should be can the Word of God we are separate and apart from the spirit. And that's what these verses when it says letter versus spirit are talking about the word letter there is the Greek word gra MMA, that sounds just like, you know, grammar, doesn't it. And it simply means a textbook is a mere document. It is a record. It can be sacred writings, it can be in a letter at an epistle. There's nothing remarkable about that word as far as giving us goosebumps. But it is maybe this will, if we treat the Bible like that. We're killing the spirit. The letter kills. I'm not saying we're killing a deity, no. But the power that they are denying as we read a minute ago, is because they were treating the Word of God as a mirror, document. Not God speaking to me. We look at the word of God as what benefit is it given me here and now? I don't care about the future, I will I want to make certain I'm a good money manager. I want to make certain I've got good home, a good employee, a good employer I want to make and here and when we're focused on the here, and the now we're missing the whole point of what Jesus came here to do for us. Does the Bible supply these things? Yes. But if that's the limit of our involvement with God's word, all the eternal blessings that God has promised us will be non existent. To embrace and approach and research God's word as a mere document, disconnects God from His word. It kills. We just saw that verse It nullifies it neutralizes another verse says it quiches, the power of the Spirit, the Spirits power that's in it, that is given when we believe it to give us empower us when we believe it, to help us to become what God wants us to be. Now, does it involve some of those things that we mentioned a minute ago? Yes, that's part of it. But the problem is, if that's the limit of our connection with God, through His Word, will be good people in this world will have a lot of those blessings, a lot of the wisdom in the Proverbs. But the eternal blessings in the power that is involved in that will be non existent. God through Paul says to the saints in Thessalonica, you've heard this verse, But now, I think it may mean more to you. For this reason, we also thank God without ceasing. Because when you receive the Word of God, which you heard from us,

Unknown Speaker  43:17
you welcomed it, not as the word of man. But as it is in truth, the word of God, which actually works in you who believe there's the power, that Word, the Holy Spirit, is enabling us through his sword. To work mightily through his word effectively, will enable us to overcome those things that we could not in our wildest dream think we can overcome. We can do that through the power of the Spirit working through his word. Okay, I thought, Ricky, you were talking about John chapter six. Okay, let's go back to John six. Remember, these people had the wrong attitude. They were thinking with their belly, and not with their spirit, not with eternity, not with God in mind. And so in order, Ben is trying to tap into this hunger that they were having with their belly. And thus he says, For my flashes, food, indeed, my blood is drink indeed, he who is my flesh and drinks, my blood abides in Me and I in him, As the Father has sent Me, I live because of the father. So he who feeds on me will live because of me, the result of eating and drinking his word, his message will be eternal blessings forever. Now, you and probably many of us have discussed this passage before they thought it He ate his flash drink is not talking about the Lord's Supper. Please remember that cringe every time I hear that, as Lord separate talk is talking about receiving His Word, His message, consuming it the bread of life for eternity. And thus that is what he's saying. When you look at verse 61. Yep, you as you might suspect, and probably those of you that know, this passes, they got upset. He said, Does this offend you? What then, if you should see the Son of Man of Sin, where he was before? So he's looking at his disciples? Is it Are you upset about you?

Unknown Speaker  45:45
Is this binging? And he says, Well, what? What if you see me go back to him? Could he be saying there? What you're saying here is not important. This body this last the way I look, everything about me physically, carnally is not important.

Unknown Speaker  46:17
And then it says, four, it is the Spirit that gives life, the flesh prophets, nothing. The words that I speak to you are Spirit, they are live their life. And so this message is what you're supposed to be hearing, and feeding upon, not the way he looked. If it was anything about the way he looked, he could have made every cloud look like him if he wanted to. That's not the point. And he there's no description hardly at all of him in the New Testament is not about it. And that's what he's saying here. This is going back to heaven. This message that I'm giving you, is what's going to empower you to be children of God, it is the Spirit, the words that are speaking to your spirit, and they are life they are live. Ladies and gentlemen, did you hear that? That was God speak. That was God speaking. Do we hear him? Whenever we hear God's word, whenever we are studying God's Word, we need to understand that God speaking, not man, not some fellow from Georgia. Not Paul, not John, it is God's speaking. And we need to make certain that we are tapped into and have the ear from our heart hearing him. Again, there's the contrast spirit versus flesh. Remember, this password we use just means go? Does this make a little bit more sense him now? Having a form of godliness, but denying its power? Elders? Have you ever heard someone saying, I just can't, I just don't seem to be able to conquer this. Whatever it is this sin, this weakness. And I just I just can't really get it, get out, repent and fall around God and almost crying about it. And the problem is that they're not hearing God in His Word, and understanding that we cannot escape his presence. And every time that we disappoint him with sin, it should break our heart because it breaks his heart. What is he done? And what have we done in response to what he did?

Unknown Speaker  49:09
Well, we deny His power to make us a new creature. Will we deny His power to be born again and let him completely remake us in His image? Will we deny it by constantly walking in sin? Or will we accept it by constantly walking in the light? That doesn't mean we won't say in in that same pass that first John chapter one it says of us, we're going to say and he says it several times. And so but if we repent quickly, and ask for forgiveness, oh, it is so much easier. But if we nurture that sin and we hide it, oh, the devil is having a heyday with us. We've got to make certain that we're not just playing a game. This is something that is very serious. We need to ask ourselves Are we just a churchgoer? You know maybe someone comes up to you you go to a church don't you? Yeah, yeah go down here to such and such Broadmoor row North Church Christ. Yeah. I've been there member for so many years and such. They're good folks, you

Unknown Speaker  50:18
ought to check us out. Maybe you've said that wouldn't it be better? Well, I'm a servant of most time God.

Unknown Speaker  50:31
I try to follow Him in His Word and try to do what he says because he loves me so much. He gives us all of this beautiful sunshine and flowers and you can listen endless list of things where he blesses us, and I can't help but seek after him with all my heart. Now they're gonna want want to know what's wrong, what's what's what's motivating you to be that way. To be such a happy, cheerful, lucky, consider lucky person. That that is that's something that's contagious, and we should be very much contagious to people to let them hear that message. So am I a fat keeper? I'm a simple regularly read the Bible, habitually family centered, pray, give no vices, no cursing, drinking, and smoking, all of those things, you know, we, and that's wrong, that we should be. We should be doing those things. That is part that is commendable. And that is something that we should be given a lot of attention to. But what is our motive in these things? Is it because my parents taught me to do this? Or is it I'm doing this just to go to heaven? You know, if I can just slide through the door at the last minute, I'd be so happy. Really? Are? Is it what God has asked of man from the very beginning all the way back to the patriarchs. God said, I'll be your God. If you will be my people. That is a relationship. That is not just a checkoff list of things that I do, right. It is a relationship that God is seeking of us not just a list of things to do, we've got to examine our motives. I sometimes people say Ricki, spell it out for me. I don't get it, and not understanding what are you getting at here? So please forgive me if this is too elementary for some people. But we, here's what a fact keeper, our church goer may look like. If we fit into some of these, then we should really give careful consideration to change. If I as a parent and more interested in secular activities and spiritual activities, as did kill your son, I'm just a fact keeper. Or if I contribute to God from my leftovers, not my first fruits of both money and time and efforts, then I may be a fat keeper. If fathers and mothers are forsaking the family in order to acquire higher things in this life, we're not talking about just food or clothing, we're talking about things much higher than that and more expensive, are if I'm choosing recreation over spiritual activities, or if sin of others has become less alarming to me. And I may even be using their sinful display of drama for my entertainment I may be just a fact keeper if the majority of faithful are becoming blind to the last all around them, and we are surrounded every day with lost people, and we just don't even see them are we excuse ourselves from from this most important command that God gave us we even have labeled it the Great Commission. And it's one of the least active

Unknown Speaker  54:58
things that you Brethren do we be armed. We just may be just a churchgoer, just a fact keeper.

Unknown Speaker  55:20
God wants a relationship with us. He is made no question mark about that. It is always been the case. He's always wanted it. He continues to want it. It Matthew 633 Probably everyone here has it memorized. Did you notice he said seek first the kingdom of God and seek first His righteousness? That is a relationship for to where the I am no longer visible it is His righteousness. People are saying can I really, really describe myself as a true disciple of Christ? Or am I just going through the motions? Like I see maybe other people do and I'm am examining my cells, myself by other people's example. Well, I'm not as bad as bla bla bla bla bla. Or I just as good as No, I wanted to scream it but make kids cry. No. We examine ourselves by his standard, always. He's the only motivation here's the only goal. Here's the only thing that I should be seeking a relationship with. God wants this relationship Am I giving it to him? I hope so every day. We should begin on our knees. We should end talking with God in our lives every day, because he is everything. We and this world certainly are not. If it's this test to your heart, you need to ask for forgiveness or need some correction or any way we can help you. One of the elders will tend to this as we stand and as we sing
