Good morning. Good to see everyone here today. Certainly a pleasure and a privilege to be able to worship with you. It's something we shouldn't and I don't think we do take for granted. So it's so good to be with you. And I'm, I'm glad that you're here to worship with me. So thank you for your attendance. John Newton was born to a religious family in 1725. Both his mother and father are religious, but his mom died when he was six years old, and his dad was often away at sea. So he was raised by a distance and cold emotionally, mother or stepmother. And he was often at a boarding school so he's not with with his family. When he was 11 years old, he joined his father on a ship as an apprentice and so he began a career out at sea. As a youth, he was marked by disobedience and rebellion, and that would eventually lead to his conscription in the Royal Navy and England. He renounced his faith, the faith of his parents at this time, and he had actually ended up deserting the Navy and he would be sold or traded as a crewman on a slave ship. Newton though continued to have unruly behavior, he openly mocked the captain, and he created wrote obscene poems that that really got him in trouble, you know, disagreements with his colleagues and because of this, his his rations were limited and he almost starve to death. He was imprisoned while he was at sea, and he actually was chained up with the slaves for which the the ship were carrying. He actually served as a slave himself in Sierra Leone before His Father intervened and rescued him from lat. He continued, though his career at sea, and he continued on a ship called grey hound. And it was on that ship that the captain said that John Newton was the most profane man that he ever knew profane, meaning ungodly or worldly. In 1748, that same ship, the Greyhound came upon a violent storm, though, one crew member was swept overboard, and John Newton chained himself to the pump of the ship as they pumped out waters for hours. And so he changed themselves to the pump so that he would not be swept overboard. The crew and everyone there thought that they were near certain death. And it was at that time that Newton uttered these words, if this will not do our efforts here at sea, then Lord have mercy upon us, the ship would be delivered, he did not die. At that time, he began to make some changes, but he also continued in his worldly ways. He did face a severe illness, which also brought him near to death. And he married a woman named Polly, that was a godly influence upon him and he began to change his life, he committed himself to Christ, later in his life, about the age 30, he actually, he find it and he ended his life out at sea. As a second career, he would become an Anglican clergyman. He would denounce slavery and become an outspoken abolitionist. John Newton lived a full life, but he's probably best known for writing the lyrics, the best known English gospel song of all time, is the one that we just seen. In 1779, he penned these words, amplified by really the drastic swing in his life. Amazing grace, how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me. I once was lost, but now I'm found Was blind. But now I see. You'll notice that the the top here The Amazing Grace, this is the actual lyrics that appeared in the book only. And so you'll see those Ss kind of look like F's without the line. So maybe a little bit hard for us to read. But those are the words that he pinned Amazing Grace. Newton knew the grace and mercy of the Lord and millions around the globe have saying his words really ever since that day, and that's what I'd like to talk for just a few moments about this morning. I want to talk to you about Amazing Grace, amazing grace that comes from God.

Jeremy Sweets  04:36
The first thing I'd like to notice about amazing grace is that God's amazing grace is a grace that saves God's amazing grace is a grace that saves. I'll read again the first verse it says Amazing grace how sweet the sound that saved a wretch like me. I once was lost but now I'm found was born. but now I see if we're going to fully understand how amazing this grace is and how sweet it sounds, then we have to understand the sad condition of being lost. The song describes a lost and blind wretch. We don't use the word wrench a whole lot today but uh Rach is a miserable, despicable person, this wretches hopelessly lost and cannot find his way. He's contemptible before all that seem, this miserable wretch has no other recourse in life, no safety net, no network of love. And if he has that safety net or network of love, he turns his back on it. But Paul describes this last stretch is one dead in trespasses and sins following the course of the world, and following me, the prince of this world and a child of wrath, and that's described in Ephesians, two verses one through three. In Romans three, verse 23, Paul describes this miserable rich as one that has been judged and found lacking. He is one that has sinned and fallen short of the glory of God. And its light of being a miserable rich, that one can say Amazing Grace, How Sweet the Sound. Grace really is, let me define the word I should have started with this grace is a gift. It is a gift of God's mercy and love. It is unmerited favor. You know, it is a time of gift giving, we often give gifts around the season. And that's all I wanted to remind us of the greatest gift that we have. And that is God's amazing grace. Amazing grace, how sweet the sound when this wretch finds not just a reprieve from the heartache, not just something that dulls the pain for a moment, but rather salvation. This miserable rich finds forgiveness from their long list of crimes. Not only that, but a different life a different way to live and a different way to think not being trapped by the slavery of sin. No, there is the sad condition of the miserable rich in the Scriptures tell us and then there's God's grace, and Ephesians four, or excuse me, two and verse four, says but God being rich in mercy, because of the great love with which He loved us, even when we were dead in our trespasses made us alive together with Christ, by grace, you have been saved, that's God's gift is unmerited. It's not something we earned. We were dead, we had no other recourse but God gives us amazing grace. In verses eight nine of Ephesians two Paul says, For by grace, you have been saved through faith. And this is not your own doing. It is the gift of God. God has given us the gift of His grace. There is the sinful choice of the ranch that falls short of the glory of God. And then there is God's amazing grace. In Romans three and verse 24, right after it says that all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God. The passage does not end there. The passage continues to tell us about Amazing Grace, being justified by his grace as a gift through the redemption that is in Christ Jesus whom God put forward as a propitiation by his blood, to be received by faith. Here we see that we have been justified we have been declared to be right, even though we have been found guilty because of God's amazing grace and the gift of redemption that can be found in Christ Jesus. Amazing Grace, How Sweet the Sound. The Amazing Grace that we're talking about is a grace that saves a grace that saves. This amazing grace is also a grace that instructs or teaches. Amazing Grace is a grace that instructs or teaches.

Jeremy Sweets  09:12
Consider the second verse of the song was Grace that taught my heart to fear and grace my fears relieved? How precious did that grace appear the hour I first believed, notice that the miserable wretch has a darkened mind. And Ephesians four four in verse 18. Paul describes this miserable wretches having been darkened in their understanding, having a Hardness of heart and alienated from the life of God. God's amazing grace not only saves a miserable wretch from the guilt of their former sins, but it also teaches instructs them into a new way of life. It teaches them about a new way of living, the hopelessness Sin, the lostness of sin is no longer the mindset of the one that has received the amazing grace of God. As a loving parent instructs a child and what is helpful for them and continually teaches them into what is good for them. So God teaches his children. God's grace teaches, first of all, from what we saw on that second verse, God's grace teaches fear teaches fear. The song says was Grace that taught my heart to fear and grace, my fears relieved noise think about the the gravity of, of the content of that lawn, it should really stop us in our tracks. Fear is really a primal emotion, isn't it? It's not something just restricted to kids, my kids will still call me in and say,

Jeremy Sweets  10:54
I'm scared of whatever situation I'm scared, especially at night when the lights are out. And I think we've seen this year that fear is not only relegated to children, isn't it? As adults, we have fears, don't we? We fear sickness, we fear losing last ones, there are things that that we are afraid of, as well. But notice here what it talks about was Grace that taught my heart to fear. But it also goes on and says grace, my fears relieved. You know, it's almost as if these lines leave us scratching our heads. Because grace seems to produce fear, and relieve fear, all at the same time. Grace first of all confronts us with the power in mind of Almighty God, all people when they recognize who he is, should stand in fear of God. Jesus taught us in Matthew 10 and verse 28. And do not fear those who kill the body but cannot kill the soul. But rather fear fear him who can destroy both soul and body and hell. Yet the righteous person even though he has a godly fear in respect of God can also find comfort and relief from his fear. The righteous can take comfort that the powerful God surrounds him with love and protection. Fears can be relieved when one stands in relationship with God. We're reminded of the psalmist in Psalm 27 In verse one, The Lord is my light and my salvation whom shall I fear? The Lord is the stronghold of my life of whom shall I be afraid? God's grace teaches us something about fear. grace, God's grace also teaches us something about restraint. God's grace teaches us something about restraint. The last stretch in Ephesians, four in verse 19, it says, has given themselves up to every kind of impurity. Now that language is an interesting language there it says, given up this portes points to the dark and seedy underbelly of sin, the sinful rich gives up their ability to set their course. They sell themselves as a slave to sin. And they suffer from an abusive master. They give themself up to sins, Cruel Intentions, locked away in a torturous, helpless and hopeless lie. Yes, they have given themselves up and they are no longer their own master sin is their master. And so they have given themselves up to every kind of impurity. You know, there is the slavery of the sinful rich, and then there's God's grace. In Titus two verses 11 and 12. It says, For the grace of God has appeared bringing salvation for all people, training us teaching or instructing us to deny ungodliness and worldly passions, and to live self controlled, upright and godly lives in the present age. God's grace teaches or instructs us not to live according to the mindset of sin, not to live within the slavery of sin, but to live a life of freedom in Christ, self control godliness, in this present age upright. That is how we need to live in God's grace. He points us in that direction, teaches us and instructs us. God God's grace calls us to be something different calls us to a greater purpose. In Second Timothy one, verses eight and nine. Paul calls on Timothy to suffer and he says, suffer for the gospel by the power of God who saved us and called us to a holy calling not because of our works, but because of his own purpose and grace, which he gave us in Christ Jesus before the ages began. Yes, Paul tells Timothy you can suffer but you can suffer because you have been called to live a different life. You've been called to be a different kind of purpose and you've been called by God's own purpose and His grace and His grace. Christians today have been called to a holy calling, we are to live a different life one of holiness and where to look difference. We know the dangers and the threats of sin. And so we have to carry through with, with what was described in Titus as self control of rightness, and godly living. Amazing Grace is a grace that teaches Amazing Grace is a grace that sustains a grace that sustains.

Jeremy Sweets  15:51
Consider the third stanza of the song, Amazing Grace, Through many dangers, toils and snares we have already come to was Grace has brought us safe thus far and grace will lead us home. The new way of life and God relieves us from the slavery of sin provides forgiveness from our past sins. It teaches us to deny on godliness. But this new life can also be filled with obstacles and trials. Many people that oppose God will oppose those that follow God and so we will face challenges in this line. But the song the song tells us in Scripture tells us that God can sustain us through the challenges. God can sustain us through the challenges. Peter acknowledged that Christians will suffer but He also promised that God's care will remain in first Peter five and verse 10. There it says an after you have suffered a little while the God of all grace, who has called you into His eternal glory in Christ Jesus will himself restore, confirm, strengthen, and establish you notice that list what God provides, as he mentions that, yes, you will suffer but God will restore, confirm, strengthen, and establish, we will face trials, but will do so with God's grace and care with his mercy and the strength that he can provide. God's grace can sustain us through the trials and the difficulties. When Paul had a physical infirmity, when he faced a thorn in the flesh, as he described it, he had a conversation with the Lord. text says in Second Corinthians that he prayed three times to the Lord, and he basically received an answer of No, I'm not going to remove that. God's reply was this, My grace is sufficient for you. For my power is made perfect in weakness. Therefore, I will boast all the more gladly of my weakness so that the power of Christ may rest upon me. God told Paul, an answer that was probably difficult to hear, he couldn't get the relief from the pain that he wanted from the thorn in the flesh, but he had to focus on something else. God said, My grace is enough sufficient for you. You know, I think we need to hear that message today, don't we? A lot of times we want pain and struggles to be taken from us. And it's good and right to pray to God for those things. And we may receive an answer of Yes, God may take that away. But we also may receive an answer of no or not yet, when we still have to endure the pain and the struggle. And that's not a that's not a case where we despair. I didn't get what I want. So I despair. Now, it's a case where we realize maybe we need to focus instead on God's grace. It's enough for us. And we need to realize the sufficiency of God's grace. The Grace filled Christian can endure the challenge with contentment, gratitude, and even peace in the midst of suffering, much more so than the disgruntled suffer. And so we need to be graceful Christians and accept that answer that sometimes, My grace God's grace is sufficient. Amazing Grace is grace that sustains grace that sustains. I'd also like to suggest that amazing grace is grace that rewards and produces hope and offers hope. Consider the fourth verse of the song. It was listed six there, there were six verses that John Newton wrote, and this one was actually not one of his original verses. And it says this When we've been there 10,000 years bright shining as the sun, we'll have no less days to sing God's praise than when we first begun. This verse was actually included in Harriet Beecher stows Uncle Tom's Cabin. And it was listed there as a song that was sung among the slaves is that tradition carried forward. And so they seen when we've been there, 10,000 years bright shining, as the sun will have no less days to sing God's praise. And when we first begun, along with the first verse, this is the verse that sticks out almost most in my mind, and what a beautiful thought it is.

Jeremy Sweets  20:41
The miserable wretch has no lasting or sustaining hope. He lives for momentary pleasures, which delivers more heartache. In the end, he seeks fulfillment, but what he finds is just a brief blood bet of pleasure, and more heartache. The miserable wretch pursues love and affection, but sin leaves her feeling discarded and unwanted. There is no contentment or satisfaction in sin. There is no contentment or satisfaction and sin. But on the flip side of that there is the the hopelessness of the miserable rich, and then there's God's grace. God's grace points us to an eternal reward. Have you ever gone on like, go karts? Or have you ever played one of those games at amusement parks, often you'll pay pay money. And they'll have a timer, you know, just when you start getting into it, start having fun, that kind of that time dealings, and it's time to end. So you got a couple of laps around the go karts, and this is great. And then okay, time's up. You can pay some more you jump on that carousel, it's going around, and you see the timer ding. And the fun is over. But heaven will be different. When we've been there 10,000 years. We don't have any less time. We don't have to watch the clock in heaven. We're not it's not the case where we just get into enjoying heaven and then the buzzer de you know, time's up, and we have to stop. That's not the case in heaven. There is no end to the joy that we will experience in heaven. When we've been there. 10,000 years we have no less time. And we can continue all of our days praising Almighty God. There is no letdown of a buzzer just pure unending joy. Peter instructs his readers in first Peter one in 13. Therefore preparing your minds for action. And being sober minded, such your hope fully on the grace that will be brought to you at the revelation of Jesus Christ. Earlier in that same epistle, Peter describes the inheritance as being imperishable, undefiled and unfading. The home we haven't haven't is not something that will perish, it will not end it will not wink it weaken or degrade. But it will continue on. And we continue to have that hope. The amazing grace that we find in God is a grace that rewards. So let me just briefly talk about our response to Amazing grace. Amazing grace comes from Almighty God and it provides for us so many benefits and blessings. We see it as a grace that saves. It is a grace that teaches it is a grace that sustains and a grace that reward So how should we respond to God's Almighty gift of grace?

Jeremy Sweets  23:58
Well, the first thing we should do is be humble. In first Peter Five Verse five, Paul instructs the younger man to clothe yourselves all of you with humility toward one another. For God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble. God wants people that are humble before him and he extends grace to those that are humble. When someone gives us a gift, we can't look at them and puff out our chests and boast and say I earned that gift. That's kind of the opposite of that, isn't it? We don't earn gifts. We don't say Look how great I am when we receive a gift. It is a humbling experience to truly receive a gift from another and we should respond to God's grace with humility. We should respond to God's grace with gratitude. When someone truly gives us a gift we need to be thankful. We need to be thankful they have thought about us a gift as an expression of love and concern, to know that they care about us. In first Corinthians one four, as Paul opens his letter to the Corinthians, he says, I give thanks to my God always for you, because of the grace of God that was given you in Christ Jesus. Paul was not only thankful for the grace that he received, but the grace of God that was extended to all of Islam, particularly the church here at corn, I give thanks to God, that should be our response. When someone gives us a gift, we need to be thankful we try to tell our children, you know, if you've been given a gift, say thank you be grateful, that should be no less the case even more the case with God, considering the magnitude of that gift, we should have a great overflow of gratitude. We should be thankful people. Not only that, but we should be gracious to others. When we have been shown grace, we need to extend that grace to others. And this is another message I teach my kids and I try to remind myself because I don't always practice it myself. We can be so exacting, sometimes can't, wanting, wanting everything to be fair, wanting everything to be just that we often overlook the grace that we need to extend other people. Yes, people have faults make mistakes, they need to be corrected. They need to repent, but we need to be gracious. And Ephesians 432. Paul says, Be kind to one another, tender hearted, being gracious to one another as God has been gracious to you. In Christ Jesus, just as God has showered us with grace, we can't then turn around and be tight fisted and angry and upset with our fellow man. Now we have to extend that grace, extend God's grace from us and continue it on to them. It's the right thing to do. And we also must respond with evangelism. When we've been showed God's gift, it's not a limited gift, where there's only so much there's only just enough for me and no one else. Now this is a gift that is freely given for all people. And as we have received the gift, we want to spread that to other people reminded of the statement where we're preaching the gospel teaching the gospel is one where one beggar tells another beggar where he found his bread. We're all miserable riches, aren't we in need of salvation, and we can tell another miserable rich. Here is where you find bread. Here is where you find grace and mercy. It is found in God through Christ Jesus. And acts 14 Verse three in face of the Iconium opposition, the apostles remained for a long time, speaking boldly for the Lord who bore witness to the word of His grace. And so they extended a message of grace to others. The last question I'll have for you is this. What will you do with God's amazing grace? It's a gift that's freely offered freely extended, and you really have two options. You can either accept His grace and humility and ingratitude, committing yourself to follow after the teaching that will point us in the direction of a new life or we can spurn that gift. We can turn our back on that gift and say, I don't want it. I don't want your gift. What will you do with God's grace?

Jeremy Sweets  28:43
If you're here this morning, you have an opportunity to become a child of God by believing that Jesus is the Christ repenting of your sins, confessing Jesus as the Christ and being baptized in the water for forgiveness of your sins. If you're living here as a Christian but not honoring the commitment that you made, then you can make changes as well. There any that are subject to the imitation please come as we stand in sin at this time.
