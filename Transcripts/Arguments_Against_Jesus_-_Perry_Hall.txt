Unknown Speaker  00:01
Good evening, everyone. Well, that's a record, I've already put everybody to sleep. We're going to talk about arguments against Jesus. That might sound like a strange thing to talk about. But we're gonna look at how people made arguments against Jesus, and how they weren't good arguments and how maybe we actually sometimes imitate them ourselves. We, my children were small. Sometimes they would ask us to buy things for them. And we sometimes will say, don't have the money for that. Most parents understand that. But our children were smart. They had arguments against that. One of them being well, we have seen a checkbook, just get out a check and start writing a check. They didn't understand the economics. Then as something else became more prominent, they would say, Well done, just go to the ATM and get money. We had to explain to them in order to get money out, you have to have money in. But we are used to children having immature arguments, because they are themselves, learning how things work. And they're also really focused on what they want. Now, when we look in the Gospel of John, we're going to discover that there are a lot of bad arguments that were made. And bad arguments can begin with bad hearts. Now, when we look at the Gospel of John, why was John written? Well, most of us understand towards the end of it, it says in John chapter 2030 31, Jesus performed many other signs in the presence of his disciples that are not written in this book. But these are written so that you may believe that Jesus is the Messiah, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in his name. Well, I want to suggest to you that John also uses an opposite approach. He shows us the bad arguments, the anemic arguments that were used against Jesus Christ being the Messiah. And when we see that, then that helps us understand, maybe a little bit better, why they should have believed that Jesus was the Messiah. Because after all, they were Bible believers. They believed in the prophets. They believed in the Torah. They are like you and I in that that way. We also are Bible believers. But we understand that sometimes when we make bad arguments, just like when they made bad arguments, it can actually come from a bad heart, or a bad attitude. Jesus himself was very harsh. And he says in John, chapter eight, verses 42, through 47, if God were your Father, you would love me, for I came forth from God, and I'm here, for I have not even come on my own, but he sent me. Why do you not understand what I am saying is because you cannot listen to my word, You are of your father, the devil, and you do what you want the desires of your father, he was a murderer from the beginning, and does not stand in the truth, because there is no truth in him. Whenever he tells a lie, he speaks from his own nature, because he is a liar and the father of lies. But because I say the truth, you do not believe me? Which one of you convicts me of sin? If I speak truth, why do you not believe me? The one who is of God hears the words of God. For this reason, you do not hear them because you are not from God. It's very harsh language. And I'm not going to say that every time we make a bad argument, it necessarily comes from a bad heart or bad attitude. But I'm also not going to suggest to you that it never does. That is why we need to learn some lessons from this. And that is that bad arguments can come from bad attitudes. We all probably have done it. And if we are making a bad argument, we need to examine the argument as other people are examining the argument.

Unknown Speaker  04:48
But we also have to examine ourselves to see if we are guilty because bad arguments are more than just bad logic. misunderstandings. or even ignorance, they can come from bad hearts. So that's where we need to begin, before we look at the bad arguments that are against Jesus, and when we look at them, I've got eight for you, we're going to be flying through them. And I want you to start making applications. We're gonna make a few when we get to the end. But I want you to see if you recognize any of these and things that you've heard or things that you have said, for example, inconsistent thinking, is a bad argument. John, chapter seven and verse 27. Here we have them saying, the religious leader, but we know where this man is wrong. when the Messiah comes, nobody will know where he is from. Why is that an inconsistent argument? Well, the reason is, is because if nobody knows where the Messiah is from, then how was Jesus not the Messiah? Because later on, they're going to argue he's from Galilee. John, chapter seven, verse 41. And if nobody knows where the Messiah is, from, how can they say, Well, we know he's going to be from Bethlehem. John, chapter seven, verse 42. inconsistency. There's a second bad argument that we see in the Gospel of John. And that is assuming the apparent first impression sometimes can give us the wrong impression in John chapter 741, to 42. Other say, Well, this is the Messiah. And you will notice that some verses are going to be repeated because one of the things I've learned is, bad arguments like to travel together. And here we got them saying this is the Messiah but others that surely the Messiah doesn't come from Galilee, does he? Doesn't the scripture say the Messiah comes from David's offspring from the town of Bethlehem where David lived? Okay. Let's look at this. They were assuming the parent, which was that Jesus was from Galilee, and therefore was not from someplace else. And Jesus was at this time from Galilee. John, chapter seven, verse one. But does that prohibit him being from Bethlehem? did he fulfill that prophecy? Yes. What was actually the simple solution to discover whether or not Jesus was from Galilee plus some other place? Just go up and ask him. We can see how this is assuming the apparent if you were to ask me where I'm from, and I've already been asked that question tonight. One answer is Millersville. Just moved here March. But if I told somebody else, oh, I'm from North Carolina. Did I lie? No. If I say, Oh, I'm from Kentucky. That's where I was born. You can be from more than one place. And if you ask some people, they'll give you the whole history. But they wanted Jesus not to be the Messiah. They had bad attitudes. So therefore, they just took the apparent. They took what they knew. And they weren't interested in learning anything else or adding to their knowledge. And that involves sometimes we can isolate one truth against another. Again, John, chapter 741 through 42. Others said, this is the Messiah. But some says surely Messiah doesn't come from Galilee does he? Doesn't the scripture say that the Messiah comes from David's offspring and from the town of Bethlehem, where David Lim, now remember, these were Bible believers, but they had forgotten or they never understood. Scriptures actually gave more than one location for the Messiah. Isaiah chapter nine, verse one talks about a light coming from Galilee. Hosea chapter 11, verse one, it's a type where it talks about my son came out of Egypt. Now where was Jesus from? Was Jesus one. Bethlehem? Jesus from Egypt? Yes. Was he from Galilee? Yes. Was he from Nazareth? Yes. So can we take just one of the scriptures that dealt with the Messiah and say all the others don't count?

Unknown Speaker  09:40
No. But that's what they were doing. isolating one truth against another. A fourth bad argument. Peer pressure and intimidation. In John Chow, per 745 and 52. Then the servants came to the chief priests and Pharisees who asked him, Why didn't you bring them? The servants answered, No man ever spoke like this. Then the Pharisees responded to them. Are you fooled to see the pressure coming on? Are you fooled to have any other rulers so the Pharisees believed in him, again, pressure. But this crowd which doesn't know the law is accursed, who wants to be accursed? Who wants to be fooled? Nicodemus, the one who came to him previously, and who was one of them said to them, our law doesn't judge a man before it hears from him, and knows what he's doing, does it? You are from Galilee to remember how John chapter one begins. Nothing good comes out of Galilee, Nazareth a bad place to be from? Investigate, and you will see that no prophet arises from Galilee. Well, what are some sources of peer pressure and intimidation. One is friends, our friends can intimidate us, our friends can pressure us to do things. I'll tell you a story of one of my children. They asked if they could go see a movie with their friends. And as parents, we asked an obvious question, okay, who are the friends? And what movie you're gonna go see? Well, she told us what the movie was, we checked it out said okay, you can go see that movie. Well, when she got there, her friends said, We're gonna go see this movie instead. And it was a movie that we would not have approved of. And our daughter knew we would not have approved of it. And so she just told them, Well, you go ahead and see. But I'm going to call my folks and they're going to come pick me up. So she calls. And so she's on the phone with my wife or mother and says, Mom, can you come pick me up, they're going to go see a movie that

Unknown Speaker  12:11
that I know that you would not approve of. And then my daughter thought she hung up. But she didn't. And so my wife can hear the conversation that she is having with her friends. And I guarantee you, my wife was listening very carefully. So she hears the friends say, remember, my daughter thought phone was hung up. Just tell your mom and dad that we went to go see the other movie. Don't ever know. And my wife starts listening even sir. As she says, but I will know. And I don't lie to my parents.

Unknown Speaker  13:09
And my wife is on the other side. You see friends can even try to convince us to do something that we know that we shouldn't.

Unknown Speaker  13:25
And then you got hopeful friends, people that we want to impress. I remember one time when I was in elementary school, I won an award for reading. And I got a prize to go to a skating rink party. And I was given two tickets and I invited my best friend. And then one of the cool kids came up to me and said,

Unknown Speaker  13:56
I really would like to go to that party. And I gave in. I told my friends that sorry. We're gonna go with this other person why? I wanted to be cool. Somehow my mom found out I don't know how she found out but somehow she found out.

Unknown Speaker  14:21
And she made me walk down to my friend's house that had Well the one I wanted to be my friend and said, I am no longer going to the party. That means you are no longer going to the party. And then I'll walk back home. And then later on at church a few weeks later, I invited one of my friends to come over and he said sure. And then one of the cool kids from church invited him to come over he said, Well, I can't go over with you because I'm going home with him. And I told my mom I said that's just not fair.

Unknown Speaker  15:01
As she said, that is exactly what you did to your friend. powerful and influential people can cause us to do things mob mentality, which is just the pressure from the crowd. You probably have seen this picture. During the days of Nazi Germany,

Unknown Speaker  15:24
how difficult was it for this one man not to give the salute? It is difficult. And anybody who says that it is not difficult to stand up against everybody else. Either one has never had to do it. And if you don't think it is difficult to stand up against friends, let

Unknown Speaker  15:47
me just say you probably don't have any friends. Because it is. Well, let's progress. A fifth bad argument is accusations. John chapter 747 and 49. And the Pharisees responded to them.

Unknown Speaker  16:05
Are you fooled to have any of the rumors or Pharisees believed in him but this crowd which doesn't know the wall is accursed.

Unknown Speaker  16:18
accusing somebody of ignorance of being fooled is something that nobody wants to be accused of. This is not answering an argument. And they probably didn't even realize that they were themselves being indicted. But we'll maybe come back to that a little bit later on.

Unknown Speaker  16:39
And then we have name calling John chapter 848. The Jews responded to them, aren't we right in saying that you are a Samaritan and have a demon? Many of them were saying he has a demon and he's crazy. Why do you listen to him? Name Calling is about the lowest form of argumentation that you can make. And then we have another type bad argument where you bind human traditions sometimes based upon misinterpretations of the Bible, John, chapter nine, verse 16. Some of the Pharisees said, This man is not from God, because he doesn't keep the Sabbath. Did Jesus keep the Sabbath? Yes, that it says it was his custom to go to the synagogue every single Sabbath. He understood it better than they did. Remember his arguments about whether or not it is right to show mercy on the Sabbath, my healing? You see, the Jews have forgotten that one of the reasons why they kept the Sabbath was it was a celebration and recognition, not just of God, creating the world. But in the 10 commandments, it is also stated that it is a remembrance for them that they once were slaves in our free. So what did we learn from that? That the Sabbath itself was a memorial of mercy. They just thought, we're not supposed to work. They didn't see because of their their human traditions that they made it even more so they made it so that it was no longer even merciful. Because of their misunderstanding of traditions, they didn't understand that one of the whole reasons for the Sabbath was God was showing them mercy by giving them rest, and reminding them that he showed mercy to them by remembering His covenant.

Unknown Speaker  18:52
And a fourth type of bad argument. Religious snobbery. The man that was born blind, they said you were born entirely in sin.

Unknown Speaker  19:04
They replied, and are you trying to teach us? Then they threw him out? Well, what are some applications for today? Well, the first part of the lesson was easy. Sort of like tearing the band aid off of somebody else. If somebody says, Can you take it off? He said, Sure, no problem. You go there and you just rip it off didn't hurt you at all

Unknown Speaker  19:35
does it? Condemning other people showing other people's mistakes. Doesn't hurt us at all. It's like tearing off the band aid from somebody. Now trying to tear off your own band aid. That hurts you might even go like this. Don't rush me. I'll do it, you don't need to do it for me. And the chair a little bit off just a little bit off and a little bit off.

Unknown Speaker  20:13
And then they start yelling at you just tear it off and you tear it off. And you realize it wasn't that bad after all. This is where we start tearing off the band aids. And hopefully, we'll learn that it's actually for our benefit. Inconsistent thinking? What is one of the causes of inconsistent thinking today? Trying too hard to prove a point. A second cause of inconsistent thinking, trying too hard to prove someone wrong. A third cause of inconsistent thinking, drawing a non existent black line of separation. Do we ever do any of these things? Do we ever try too hard to prove a point? Now, if I had another week, I could go through and give examples of every single one of these. And maybe we'll go over one or two examples. But we can try too hard, because we're more interested in winning an argument than we are and winning a soul. And we don't need to be the Pope to think that we are infallible. We can be guilty of inconsistent thinking. What is a second way that we can make the same mistakes? We can assume the apparent. So can we win assuming the apparent? Can we believe what we want to believe? Not because the evidence is overwhelmingly true, but because it agrees with us?

Unknown Speaker  22:07
I don't know about you. But I would much rather find out that I'm right than I'm wrong.

Unknown Speaker  22:20
I don't know too many people that enjoy being wrong. But we can believe what we want to not based upon further study. But because we learn something at one time. We got that one fact. We don't need to add any more facts because they just might confuse

Unknown Speaker  22:45
us. And we like being right. We want to believe what we believe. And we can isolate one truth against another. Have you ever heard anybody argue debate points versus scriptural points? And they use the bait points instead of using the scripture in order to win an argument instead of

Unknown Speaker  23:12
a soul? Let me ask you this question. Does any single verse have all the truth of that

Unknown Speaker  23:23
topic? No. You can learn a truth from any verse. But you cannot learn all the truth from a single verse. And I'll give an example here. I was at a congregation thinking about moving there. And I was doing a class on on evangelism. And I asked the question, are we saved by faith? And somebody said, not by faith only. Well, that's a biblical verse that we are not saved by faith only. Okay. So we are not saved by faith only James chapter two. Are we saved by faith? Not by faith only. Okay. Are we saved by faith? Not by faith only. Okay, so we have established that we are not saved by faith only.

Unknown Speaker  24:37
The question is, are we saved by faith? You want to guess what the response was? Not by faith. Only. You might be surprised, but I didn't move there. Does the Bible teach that we are saved by Have Faith justified by faith? Saved by belief? Yeah. I doubt very seriously the person who kept saying, not by faith only would have any problem whatsoever. If I asked the question, Does baptism now save us? Yes.

Unknown Speaker  25:19
Well, is that true that baptism now saves us? Yes. Is it also true that we are justified by faith? Romans chapter five verse one? Yes. We can't just take one truth from one verse and say that covers it all. But we can be guilty of isolating one truth against another because we're more interested in winning an argument, repeating debate points, than we are speaking like the scripture, and let me tell you some it is shameful if we speak more like men than we do, like God, amen. But we do that when we isolate the truth, one verse against another and there's peer pressure and intimidation have spiritual leaders ever use position influence to bully the less powerful yes they have? Do preachers ever form cliques and clubs based upon agreement with one another more than a willingness to be challenged? Yes, they do this is where I'm holding in my head. How much do I really want to tell these people about

Unknown Speaker  26:42
me I have been excluded before and I probably have excluded other people. So it's not me just pointing fingers at other people I remember a time and it's past where preachers were known by

Unknown Speaker  27:11
the magazine that they were associated with now I have written for various magazines that I did not agree with everything that was published in that magazine I have written for magazines that probably had nasty things said about the other within the

Unknown Speaker  27:40
magazines but it's really a shame when preachers will use this against another preacher without ever understanding but why did you write for that other magazine? It may be I wanted to try to see if I could influence them for good maybe on another topic that if I gain confidence on this that then maybe they might listen to me on that but when peer pressure and intimidation come oftentimes we have the accusations of follow the we give into temptation of hurting another person's reputation rather than answering their argument I supposed to preach a gospel meeting at a congregation and a lady that I knew called me up and she said I just learned that you've been taken off the list.

Unknown Speaker  28:45
So really, yeah. So why were you taken off the list? I said I don't know.

Unknown Speaker  28:53
Well, I'm gonna find out I said Okay, good for you. She went asked the elder said Why was pairing disinvited from holding a gospel meeting? The answer

Unknown Speaker  29:05
was well because he's turned liberal. So she called me up she said have you turned liberal? I said no, I have not turned liberal Okay, good. I'm gonna go tell the elders you have not turned liberal

Unknown Speaker  29:27
how much information actually passed within that conversation sometimes I will get a call. We're visiting town and we before we we visit you on Sunday, we just want to make sure you're a sound congregation. Are you a sound congregation? This is where I try to behave. Because I want to say No, we are unsound. And we are all going to hell. Would you like to come worship with

Unknown Speaker  30:09
us? And I just generally say yes, we are sound congregation. Okay. Thank you very much. And then that's it. You see accusations flow right along with name calling. Are we willing to resort to the lowest form of argument together people on our side?

Unknown Speaker  30:39
Is labeling easier than answering? Notice in every single one of these, I have just simply asked you questions. And the answer to every single one, unfortunately, is, yes, sometimes. Labeling somebody's easier than answer, I don't care what realm it is, whether it's religious, whether it's political, it does not matter. If you just want to shut down anybody's thinking or any further conversation, start accusations, start name calling. And then some people will just be scared off from talking to you any further, and some people will believe lies about you.

Unknown Speaker  31:27
But Christians do this. And then we have bound human traditions. Could we be more familiar with church of Christ tradition than with scripture? Yes, you want to know why we practice our tradition more than we study the Scriptures.

Unknown Speaker  32:04
Now where I am currently, we have Sunday night services where I was before we did not have Sunday night services. And I remember reading a long time ago. An article in a gospel magazine that while there is nothing in scripture that says you have to have Sunday night services, if you do not have Sunday night services, you are an unscriptural congregation.

Unknown Speaker  32:39
Now I've been a part of a congregation that had three services on Sunday morning. Men apart congregation that has Sunday morning service Sunday night services. I think sometimes we forget a simple truth that one time it just just dawned on me. And you know how sometimes simple little truths can just

Unknown Speaker  33:08
there is not a single command in here that we obey. That does not involve some kind of man made method. I'll give you example. I'm preaching. You're not? What is your position right now? Not on my preaching. We're not going to talk about that.

Unknown Speaker  33:37
Your position is you're sitting down. My position is I'm standing up. Was this the tradition in Jesus day? In Jesus day, he went into the synagogue he stood up to read and this as he sat down to speak, why because they wanted that was their tradition, a physical separation, a reminder that when the person was standing, that they were reading God's word, but when they were sitting, they were given their explanation. We do have it's impossible not to manmade methods of obeying commands. That's not the problem. The problem is when we start to equate those manmade methods with the command and when we do that, we are rewriting scripture. Then we have religious snobbery, how do we versus them ever have a place in discovering truth versus error? Never Do we accept the truth because of what religious group teaches it? Or do we reject the truth because of what religious group teaches it.

Unknown Speaker  35:15
And when we make those eight bad arguments we're not just guilty of having empty pockets. We are emptying our mind of Scripture. And we are not progressing in the Scriptures. And just as the children have problems with their arguments, we have problems because if we are making those eight arguments, then we are spiritually mature. And we are focused more on what we want, then reality. Now I'm going to show you how I end every single sermon with three things. What is your one takeaway point? Ask yourself, how much has really changed since the days of Jesus walking the earth? Not much. Ask yourself, Am I mature enough spiritually to make mature arguments. And so that means that you're one takeaway point, my one takeaway point, everyone's one takeaway point is you and I, we need to be careful. Because we can be more like the scribes and the Pharisees and the Sadducees, then we want to know what to admit. So watch out. Because not much has changed. I like to give calls of action applications. And we're going to find an opposite way to take those bad arguments. So that we can learn something positive. Understand true consistency does mean changing. I've run across two groups of people. One of those, they are proud that they've never changed their mind on anything. And then the others, they are proud that they change their mind on everything. And they will have absolutely nothing to do with each other. But they don't realize they are exhibiting the same sin, pride in knowledge. True consistency does mean you change, but it doesn't mean you change for the sake of change. We need to go beyond what appears right to find what is right. Keep going deeper. That's why Jesus said in John chapter seven, judge according to righteous judgment. Allah wish I had time to study that one with you. Take all the God says on a topic, not just what's convenient. Learn to surf instead of intimidating others, and playing party Association. Except all are ignorant, including yourself on some things, when you're studying with somebody, one of the best things that you can tell them is I did not know that. Then you gain their confidence. I used to have a call in radio show in a couple of different states. And every once a while, I would say you know, I don't know. I'll have to study and I'll get back to you. I didn't realize at that time. How powerful that was as an impact on the listeners because I would have people call and said I just want you to know that I appreciate the fact that you say you don't know we everything uplift through claiming instead of demeaning with derogatory naming, I liked the fact that I named that I got that to Ryan by the way.

Unknown Speaker  39:50
become more familiar with Scripture than how we have always done it. believe truth regardless if it comes from us, or some other source, what's the last way that I end every sermon? Where's the gospel and what I just talked about don't know if you notice a commonality in all those bad arguments they happen in John chapter seven, eight and nine. And it's all within the same time period. And they all deal with who Jesus was. All the arguments against Jesus was about his identity. We have to understand that Jesus crucifixion means everything. If Jesus is who he claimed to be, and claims, to be, I say claims the present tense because Jesus resurrection means everything because it proves Jesus is who he claimed, and claims to be. So who Jesus is. Me means everything. Whereas the gospel, I think it's fitting to close with an argument for Jesus being who he claimed and claims to be. In John chapter 20, Tom has argued, if I don't see the mark of the nails in his hand, put my finger into the mark of the nails and put my hand into his side. Notice it says into his not just touch into means that Jesus resurrected body still had the remains of the crucifixion. I will never believe so. What is Thomas doing? He's making an argument. I need evidence. Without evidence, I'm not going to believe. Well, Jesus a week later comes to him and he doesn't berate him for making an argument against his resurrection. He provides a counter argument, Put your finger here and look at my hands. Reach out your hand and put it into my side. Don't be faithless.

Unknown Speaker  42:22
But believe and that's where the gospel is. Jesus is who he said. He is. Amen. If you need to respond, you're saved by believing. But we don't isolate one verse against another. You're also saved by mercy. But we don't just take two. There's also grace and hope that were say bye. There's confession. There's repentance. And there's baptism. If you need to respond to who Jesus is, we invite you to come now while we stand and say
