Good morning. It's good to see everybody here today, we have a full crowd. And that's good to see. We have many visitors here with us. We appreciate the fact that you're here with us. And it's just good to be here to worship God. And so I'm thankful that you are are here with me and with us here and beyond the alert, watch out. That is the message that's found in the readiness parables in Matthew chapter 25, or 2445 through 25/3. That accounts for three different parables. The first one is at the end of chapter 24. And that one talks about the faithful and unfaithful steward. Then we have the five why's and the five unwise maidens are virgins. And then we have the parable of the talents. All of these parables relay the message, be ready, get ready, be prepared, like to look for just a few moments at these parables and see what we can learn from these parables. The first of all, these parables come into all of it discourse and Matthew 24 and 25. So those two chapters are the context for these parables. And we see that in those parables Jesus is looking over the Granger of Jerusalem, he's looking out with his disciples. And they asked this question, Lord, or look, Teacher, what wonderful stones and what wonderful buildings, they were looking upon the temple which was, they say, wonderful, inspired all as they looked at this temple. Josephus describes the mass of marble stones of the temple foundation is white, and strong. And they measured 40 feet long by 12 feet high by 18 feet wha. So you can imagine the mass of these stones, they were higher than two people 40 foot long, they were massive stone. The letter to aristeas describes the temple is so strong that no one could force his way into the precincts. They were impenetrable. It was unimaginable that this massive structure could ever be overcome. And so they say, look at these wonderful stones. Well, Jesus responds and Matthew 24 In verse two in this way, you see all these, do you not truly I say to you, there will not be one, there will not be left here, one stone upon another, that will not be thrown down. They are looking at the magnificence of the temple. And Jesus says it's this very temple that's going to be destroyed. And Jesus relays the message that not only will it be destroyed, but there is imminent destruction. That is about to happen. It is coming and it is coming soon. And I'm sure they were left scratching their hands. You're talking about this temple.

Jeremy Sweets  03:18
How big it is, look at how important it is. Well, imminent destruction. With that, I'd like to introduce you to my wife's grandfather. His name is John Douthat. He was a pilot in the US Air Force from 1950 to 1972. And when it comes to our nation's history, those are pretty important years because they were fighting some some wars and battles. After World War Two, the the allies that were together, Russia and the United States, a wedge was driven between those nations from social and political differences. And they were no longer allies together, they became enemies. And even though they would never fight a war together, we see that they had the Cold War, the Cold War, so tensions increase, they, they got more arms, they prepared for war, they prepared for an all out war. And so that was between, again, Democratic United States and communist Russia. So a couple of the wars that he would have fought in would have been Korea and Vietnam. Now both of those were over the spread of communism. It was really an extension of that whole Cold War idea. And so we see that he continued to fight or fly a bomber pilot or bomber during that time. Now one of the most important missions that he flew was called Operation Chrome Dome, Operation Chrome Dome. So in the 1950s, they would have cycles of planes that would go from United States to the edge of Russia. And so they would cycle in and someone was in the air these others were getting ready and they would cycle in why were they doing that? They were prepared for battle at any moment's notice they were ready to drop nuclear weapons on Russia. And so he had to be prepared in order to do that. Well, the the tensions came to a head in 1962. October, we see that there was the Cuban Missile Crisis. It was bad enough when Russia was threatening to bomb us. But now we have Cuba that allies with Russia. And they are right, close the United States, just south of the United States. And so there was this imminent threat. My mom was a 12 year old girl in 1962. In fact, she lived in Belle Glade, Florida. And so that's the south of Florida. You see it right there, above Miami, and a 12 year old she was prepared. She was huddled she was going through the things you have to do in school to prepare for a nuclear weapon, although I'm not sure there's really much preparation you can do for that. And she was scared. She was on the alert. John doubt that there in this time was prepared, within a 15 minutes notice to be up in the air and ready to fly. He gets the, the the alarm. And within 15 minutes, he has to be up in the air and going wheels up. And so he was prepared. And so when we see this threat of imminent destruction, there's really two things that we see that come out of that. And as Be on the alert, and be prepared beyond the alerts and be prepared. That that is the message that Jesus is bringing as well. Now, they were looking at this marvelous temple and it was unimaginable that the the city of Jerusalem and the temple would be overthrown. But Jesus points to that, and says there is imminent destruction. And he's going to take these readiness parables and say, What? Beyond the alert and be prepared beyond the alert and be prepared.

Jeremy Sweets  07:25
So let us look at these parables. And I know there's three parables, I didn't think that was enough to discuss them one sermon. So let's just talk about Matthew 24, as well, right. Matthew 24 is a notoriously difficult passage, but I think there's some things we can still learn. And it's helpful to know that that is the context of these parables. So in chapter 24, verses one through three, we see that disciples ask a question in verse three, when will these things happen? And what will be the sign of Your coming and judgment. And at the end of the age, you'll notice that they conflate or they combine the destruction of Jerusalem with the end of the age. And I think they probably do that, because it was unimaginable that this would happen at any other time. If this great temple was the fall, surely this is the end. This is the end of all things. So when is this going to happen? What would be the sign of Your coming in judgment enter the end of the A, and Jesus responds. And he responds by separating what they had combined, and looking at the two separate judgments. And there's a lot that could be said on Matthew chapter 24. But I want you to notice this one thing. And that is that there is a distinguishing factor that Jesus makes between these two judgments. And that is the destruction of Jerusalem will be accompanied by discernible signs. You'll be able to see and know that this is coming. There will be wars and rumors of wars, tribulation, false prophets, false messiah, you'll see the abomination of desolation. And then in verse 33, he says this. So also when you see all these things, you know that he is near at the very gates, truly I say to you, this generation will not pass away until all these things take place. And that takes us up to verses two verse 35. Now, there's something very different, though, about the end of the age and what is that? The final judgment will have no songs, it will not be known. You will not have a warning in any way. And it will come without notice. And so he separates what the disciples enjoying and said there will be a destruction of Jerusalem and there will be the end of the age. Now as we talk about this into the age, these readiness parables come are framed by they come in between discussions of judgment and the final judgment. The first one we see is with the, the, the analogy of the days of Noah, he transitions from the destruction of Jerusalem to the end of the age in verse 36, with this statement, but concerning that day in our no one knows, not even the angels of heaven, nor the Son, but the father, only Jesus uses the days of Noah is an analogy for his return, concluding with a clear exhortation. And he gives that final exhortation in verse 42, when he says this, Therefore stay awake, for you do not know on what day your Lord is coming. And again, in verse 44, therefore, you also must be ready for the Son of Man is coming at an hour, you do not expect, do you see how he's shaping that theme? He says, You're not going to know when the Son of Man is coming. But you need to be ready, be on the alert. And so he talks about that, he concludes with a final judgment seen at the end of chapter 25. And in between are these readiness parents be read. Now these parables form a unit together, and they share many common features. In fact, there are three iterations of really the same parable in a sense, and the same message. And then as first of all the characters, you have what Bloomberg calls a triad or a triangle. And this is found in many different parables where you have the master at the top, and you have even an individual or a group on each side, good, faithful servants, and evil servants. And so you find that the master and these are the master departs, and he returns at an unknown time.

Jeremy Sweets  12:11
The servants while the master is away, are given a task or given responsibilities that they must complete. And then when the master does return, there are consequences to be handed out both rewards and punishments. So all three of the parables we're going to be looking at follow this common characteristic, this this common feature. So with that, let's notice these parables, let's look at them for just a moment. First of all, there's the Parable of the Wise and Foolish servant. The Parable of the faithful and unfaithful stewards found in Matthew 24, verses 45 through 51. And there is a parallel in Luke 12. But in this parable, a master charges his steward with dispensing food rations to his fellow slaves. And so he must have been an extremely important student, because he because he is charged with the care of all of the different servants, so he must have been a high ranking servant to be charged with such an important task. So he's, he's charged with giving the rations and the preparations to those that are around him. We say in verse 45, that the opening words present the key words for this, this set of parables, who then is the wise and faithful servant? Who then is the faithful and Weisler? And the answer is found in the next verse, the good servant is the one whom the master finds, in steady, constant service when he returned. He's not doing some extraordinary feat he's not he's not doing something, some amazing spectacle, but rather he is consistently doing his job. What he is supposed to that is the good and faithful servants. But notice that the evil servant, or should I say, this same servant, has the potential to be evil if he thinks in a different way, and acts in a different way. So this same servant could choose a different path if he dismisses the return of his master, and says to himself, My master is delayed. He could walk laps into debauchery, and really the very opposite of his commission. Instead of caring for his fellow servants, he beats them it's instead of filling their bellies with food, he gorges himself with food, and he drinks Texas. So he turns around the very mission that he is supposed to be fulfilling, and he takes it for himself instead. fishes. The text states that the master of the servant will come on a day when he does not expect and will cut him in pieces and cast him while there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. The servant will respond to the or the the master or respond to the servant when he comes at an unknown time. The next parable is the Parable of the Wise and Foolish maidens sometimes called virgins, but these would have been wedding attendants, wedding attendants, and you have two groups of wedding attendants here. This is found in Matthew 25, verses one through 13. The Jewish custom for for a wedding was really found in two parts. The first part would have taken most of the day and it would have been a feast where there had been an exchange of commitments, divine blessings, we might think of something typical to the wedding ceremony that we have, but it would have been a little looser and family been around and had been a celebration that was there.

Jeremy Sweets  16:08
The second part of a Jewish wedding was the feast that would take place at the groom's house. And the highlights of the night was the festival procession, or as it was approaching night, they would take their lamps and the torches and they would guide the married couple in that direction. For this parable, we see that the, the maidens had apparently already accompany the bride to the groom's house, and they were waiting for the groom to come. Now often that would have happened because the groom would have stayed, stayed at that first part of the wedding feast, and he would have negotiated the dowry with with the groom's parents and so they might have been delayed and separate. So they have brought the the bride already to the groom's house waiting for this feast. Okay, they're waiting on the groom. In this parable, we see that there are foolish and wise maidens and they are differentiated by their level of preparedness. The wise maidens have oil, and the foolish attendants have none. Well, when the announcement comes at midnight, that the groom has arrived, there was quite the lane, the y's are ready for the festival possession and they join the groom at the feast. But the foolish virgins are not prepared. They request oil from their fellow attendants. And when they find none, they have to go and try to buy some. But when they come back, it is already too late. And chapter 25 Verse 13, we see the conclusion, watch there for for you know, neither the day nor the hour. And so the y's are in, emitted into this wedding feast. And the foolish are cast that they are cast out. The final parable in this group is the parable of the talents. And this is found in Matthew 25, verses 14 through 30. And there's a close parallel and Luke 19 as well. Like the first parable, this final parable involves a Master who departs on a long journey, and he leaves his servants behind with responsibilities. This time the the master gives the the stewards of the servants his his wealth, so that they might maintain it. One is given five talents. One is given two talents, and one is given a single talent. Now each talent don't need to think in terms of dollars or maybe $100. Each talent was a tremendous amount of money, it would have been equivalent to 20 years of wages for an average day laborer. So this is a retirement lump sum. This would have been a life savings for an average worker. Now this wealthy landowner had many of these talents but he gives these to the stewards to watch over. So even the one talent man possessed the substantial fortune

Jeremy Sweets  19:22
now notice the the work of the servants they approach the money very differently. The first man goes to work at once it says, And he trades for five more talents. The second man does likewise he goes at once immediately he gets to the work, and he also gains two more talents. The Third Man though, he went and dug a hole in the ground, and he hid his single talents. So when the master comes back, there is a reckoning. The master returns it says after a long time He came to settle the accounts. The first man stepped forward and presented his accomplishments and he was commended for His servants. Well done. It says good and faithful servants. He has fulfilled his responsibility in a good way and it pleased the master, he was called to enter into the joy of his master. The second man does the same thing. He steps forward and presents, there's no hesitation, he is eager to show the work that he has done for the master. The third individual though the third worker is different. He does not approach with a presentation. But he approaches with excuses. He says this, he knew the man was a hard man says, and he was afraid of him, which is why he hid the talent. The master addresses the servant and reveals his character. He says, You are a wicked and slothful servant, he should have left his money with bankers instead of hiding it in the ground, and his talent is stripped away from him. A worthless servant will be stripped of his ability to serve. And that's exactly what happens to this third individual. And he has cast into outer darkness where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth. Jesus is using this parable to reference not the return of a physical master and dealing with money, but the return of Jesus Christ. And the message is be alert and be prepared. Be ready for the Masters return. Now, this was written 2000 years ago, but this is vitally important for us today. It's so important for us to realize this, this message is for us. I'd like to look at three lessons as we conclude. The first one is that we need to be watchful and alert. We need to be watchful and alert. As Christians we can never lose sight of our masters return. Five times with our text, Jesus echoes, the refrain that the day and hour of His return will not be known. It cannot be expected. There are no signs of the time of Jesus return. Now many have tried to predict the date of his return. But they have all ended in failure and disillusionment, disillusionment. In fact, it's very dangerous to try to predict the day of His return, or putting our hope in the wrong thing. If we think that we can predict that Jesus doesn't say, watch the signs and then get ready. He says Be ready at all times. And so we must work with the same sense of urgency as if Christ is coming soon. Now there is a danger in trying to predict his return. But I think probably more for us, I think we've been taught or hopefully we've been taught to avoid the prediction. But maybe a greater danger for us is to dismiss his return altogether. I mean, it's been 2000 years and he hasn't come yet. And so we forget. Maybe this isn't going to happen. That's what they said in Second Peter chapter three, the critics that attractors were saying, you know, God hasn't come yet. Therefore, he's not coming. And that's a danger for us. Now, we need to remember these parables as they push us to be alert and be ready. Christ is coming again. We don't know when so how can you prepare for an event when you don't know what's gonna happen? How can you prepare for that? Well, you have to be ready at all time. ready at all times. Let us echo the words of Paul in First Corinthians 16, verse 22, Maranatha. Come, Lord Jesus. We are ready and prepared.

Jeremy Sweets  24:06
The second lesson we need to learn is that we need to be faithful in service faithful and servants. The readiness parables promote faithful service with good and bad examples. First, consider the ways that that the unfaithful servants acted. The first parable demonstrates unfaithfulness through insubordination, insubordination, he simply turns around, and does the opposite of what he's supposed to do. He rejects his mission altogether, and says, I'm not going to do that. And so he was on prepared. In the second pair role, we see the maidens, and they were not rebellious in that sense, but they were in attentive. They were not paying attention. They were going about their activities, unaware without thinking about what can happen Do you think that could happen to us today, going about our activities, forgetting about the fact that the Lord may return. And then we see in the third example, in activity, they simply did nothing, that that third servant simply did nothing. He hid his talent in the ground. And he did nothing. All of these are warnings for us today and examples of how we can be unfaithful. If we act and rebellion and selfishness serving ourselves rather than others and God, if we are in attendance, simply not paying attention to what God requires of us, or if we are inactive, and we simply decide to do nothing. Well, the good examples of faithfulness are found in the first example of the wise steward. He practices consistent and faithful servant service. He just simply does what he's supposed to do. As Christians, we're not called to, to do some superhuman feats. We're not in a competition where we're trying to be first and outdo everyone else. That is not our job. Our job is faithful, consistent service. The wise maidens exhibit foresight, and they make preparations brings I want to tell you, Jesus is coming up again. So let us make preparations. Let us be prepared. Let us be working toward that in and the wise stewards in the final parable of the talents. They act immediately, decisively and eagerly. I have no time to waste. No time to waste. That should be a description of us. There's no time for us to waste Let us act decisively, immediately and eagerly. And so they exam provide for us examples of faithful servants and we should imitate their faithful servants. And finally, let's be motivated. Let's be motivated. These parables provide vivid pictures of what awaits both the wise and the unwise servant. Jesus provides the motivation within these parables the wicked servants meet a horrifying in they are cast from their Masters presence into a place of outer darkness and weeping of gnashing of teeth and weeping and gnashing of teeth. There is the master and then away from him there is darkness, there is the master and then away from him there is pain and sorrow. So what is there with the Master? Well, those that are faithful are welcome into the Masters company. The wise maidens join the wedding feast with the bridegroom, the resourceful stewards are told well done good and faithful servants Enter into the joy of your master. So what is the difference here? What awaits the wicked versus the righteous, the righteous get to be with the Master? Oh, happy day, oh, glorious thoughts.

Jeremy Sweets  28:24
For there is true joy, you enter into the joy of the master, and you rejoice in his presence with him. But the wicked are cast away from the presence of the master. And there is pain and there is sorrow. I'm sure there's a sense of I wish I had done something differently. Don't let that be you. Be a faithful servant. Be one that is ready and prepared for the Masters return. If you're here this morning and you're not a Christian, you have an opportunity to obey the gospel message, believing that Jesus is the Christ, repenting of your sins confessing Jesus as the Christ and being baptized in the water for forgiveness of your sins. If you're here this morning and you are a Christian and you're not honoring the commitment that you may, which is a lifelong commitment. If you're not living as you should you also need to make corrections. If there are any that are subject to limitation, please come as we stand and sing
