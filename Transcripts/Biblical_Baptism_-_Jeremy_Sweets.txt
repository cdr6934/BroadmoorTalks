Good evening. Good to see everyone here tonight, certainly good that we can gather together and worship our God. Even more appreciative of the fact, because of all these circumstances, just being able to gather together and worship. It's a real blessing. So I'm glad that you're here. And I'm certainly glad to be here with you. I'm going to talk about the subject of biblical baptism tonight, biblical baptism. It's not often that I do a series and maybe that's just because of the way that we're splitting up services between the different preachers, but for the last four Sunday nights I've been scheduled. And so I didn't really intend to start off with a series but it's ended up that way. And so we're just going to continue on and look at biblical badasses. That doesn't seem to work. So I will start here. And Ephesians chapter four, Paul encourages the Corinthians there, to be eager to maintain the unity of the Spirit, in the bond of peace. As Christians, we are all united together, not in anything of our own making, not of anything that that we decide, but in the unity of the spirits. It is what God has designed for us. And that is a bond of peace we are brought together and in peace in Christ and peace together. He goes on to describe seven things that bring us together that unite us that Bond's us together. And there Paul says in Ephesians, four and verse four, there is one body and one spirits, just as you are called in one hope of your calling, one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and Father of all, who is overall and through all and in all. First of all, we are united together in the fact that we serve one god that is found in the father that is found in the Lord Jesus Christ, and that is found in the Spirit. God is one and we are united together in our service to God. We share a common faith together, we proclaim a common statement of faith in our God. We're in one body together, headed in the same direction guided by our faith, and headed in the direction of heaven. We have one hope together. One of the items that he mentions, there is one baptism. As Christians, we are united together and the fact that we have been baptized. This is the baptism that I want to talk about tonight, biblical baptism. At Broadmoor, our goal and desire is to give God praise and all things and to adhere to his word, the follow after his word. And so we're going to talk about the one baptism that we find in Scripture, biblical baptism. It's our desire to be biblical and to follow after the words of God. And so that's what we're going to discuss tonight. First of all, baptism, biblical baptism is a consummation of faith. It is a completion. When a student takes all of their coursework, they receive a diploma and a graduation ceremony where they are deemed to have graduated. When a couple of gets engaged, they go to a marriage ceremony, where they are deemed to be married. faith and baptism go hand in hand, baptism is the completion of faith it is it is where faith leads one, two, it is the consummation or the completion of faith. When one becomes a child of God and receives forgiveness of sins that is found in baptism, in Galatians, chapter three and notice in verse 25, Galatians three and verse 25.

Jeremy Sweets  04:13
All talks about where our salvation comes from where our justification comes from, is it from the law, and Paul says, no is not from the law, but it is found in faith in Christ. Notice in verse 25, but now that faith has come, we are no longer under a guardian. For in Christ Jesus, you're all sons of God through faith. For as many of you as were baptized into Christ, have put on Christ. As many of you has been baptized into Christ have put on products. You'll notice that we are sons of God, all of us children of God together before Him through faith. It is through our belief in God through our acceptance of who he is our submission to His will, it is through faith. He goes on there to say that we are all in Christ and put into Christ in baptism. That is where we close ourselves with Christ. And we share that common clothing, don't we? We have all been closed with Christ. And so we see that faith leads one to baptism points to baptism. We are sons of God in Christ through faith, and we are put into Christ through baptism. In the book of Acts, we see that that baptism follows after faith, when the preaching went out and was declared to the people they would believe, and that would lead them to baptism. You might notice the Ethiopian unit. When the Ethiopian eunuch was taught about Jesus in the Scripture, he said, See, here's water. What stops me or prevents me from being baptized? Many manuscripts have a statement by Philip in response to that it says, If you believe with all your heart, you may, if you believe you may, Faith will lead you in the direction of baptism. We also see the flip in jailer when he asked Sirs, what must I do to be saved? Paul and Silas replied and act 16, verse 31, Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved you and your household. That's a very succinct statement. Certainly that doesn't include everything that was spoken that night. But when he asked, What must I do, they replied, that you must believe believe in the Lord Jesus. And then what did they do? In verse 33, it says that he took them the same hour of the night and wash their wounds, and he was baptized at once, he and all his family, once he had become convicted of the truth, and Jesus, he was baptized, we see that baptism is the completion of faith. It is where faith leads one, two, might also add another comment here about about baptism is that it is a tangible thing. It is something that you can point to.

Jeremy Sweets  07:20
In the early 19th century, as people were struggling with their faith in the teachings of many different denominations, and people that were there, there were many people that were waiting for the spirit to enter in their heart so that they could be saved. And that caused a lot of difficulty among people as they were waiting for the spirit to enter into their hearts. And there was a lot of frustration for people that wanted to be saved, but they didn't know if they had reached that point or not. And so they kept waiting for this spirit to come. There are many that preach though, that salvation is not something that you can earn, but it's something that you can have confidence that you can hide. The Bible points us in the direction of accepting those things, believing that Jesus is the Christ repenting of her sins, confessing Christ and being baptized. And so that that gives people it removes that that doubt that people had as they were waiting, am I a believer or not? Am I saved or not? Well, they could look to their baptism and say, Yes, I am saved. They could point to something tangible. Just as when a couple gets married, they could point to their marriage ceremony say, this is when it happened. Now you when you begin to fall in love and fall in love with each other. When did that happen? When was the exact point? Sometimes that's a process is, we don't know exactly when that point is, but we can point to something tangible, to when we got married. The same thing is true for faith. Faith is a process where we hear God's word, we come to accept those things and that can take place over a period of time. And we may begin to wonder in question, am I say Have I accepted those things? Well Bampton baptism gives us a tangible point in which we can say that we have accepted the Word of God. Martin Luther was one that I'm reminded of here as well. He struggled with whether he was saved or not, and he sank into depression and had lots of difficulties. But he would often say, I know that I've been baptized. He looked back to his baptism and found confidence that I can know that I had been saved, had my sins washed away. I know that I'm a Christian and he could look back to his baptism. I think that's helpful for us. It provides something tangible for the decision that we make, to follow after God. So the first point I want to make is that baptism is a consummation of completion of faith.

Secondly, baptism is immersion into new life, immersion into new life. Biblical baptism is immersion it means to be fully submerged or immersed into water. And Acts chapter eight, when Phillip preached to the Ethiopian unit, the text states that they both went down into the water, Philip and the unit, they went down into a body of water, and then it says, and he baptized him or he immersed him. So they both went down into the water, and then he baptized him. The picture that we have, there is one of immersion, he worship, not sprinkling, not pouring, but immersion. The form of baptism is important here. And important points also the function of baptism. Baptism is a barrier, the putting to death of the old man, and the Raising to walk in newness of life. The form and the function are tied together, they are connected. The form of baptism is immersion. And that is a picture of what a Christian is committing himself to, to put the old man to death, and to raise to walk in newness of life. In Romans six and verse three, there, Paul says, Do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into his dead, we were buried therefore with him by baptism in the dead, in order that just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, we too, might walk in newness of life. Jesus Christ was put to death, and he was buried, and then he was raised. We are a picture of what Jesus Christ accomplished. We put to death, the old man of sin, we make a commitment. I'm no longer going to live that way. Sin separates me from God. And I don't want to have any part of that any more. And so we put to death, the old man the way of selfishness and self interest, and we are buried, we are buried in baptism, we are immersed in water, and we are raised from the water from the watery grave to walk in newness of life. We live a different life. We have a clean conscience, our sins have been washed away. We have a different mindset and a different direction and purpose we are following after God and His will. Following after God and His way. We are immersed into new life. Paul exhibits this new life and he showed that when when he was converted when he was baptized, Jesus told Saul when he appeared to him, that he was he was calling him for this purpose to appoint you as a servant. And as a witness, saw who would change his name to Paul was chosen for a purpose, to be a servant, and to be a witness. Now he had a special calling a special mission. I would say that all of us are chosen to be servants of his we are chosen to be devoted to him. When the blinded saw appear before Anand is when he was told to go to he asked this. And now why do you wait, rise and be baptized and wash away your sins calling on his name. And Saul did just that. He made a complete change in his life. He was immersed into a new life, wasn't he? He went from being a persecutor of the church, putting to death those that oppose Judaism, those that proclaim the gospel, putting those in prison that refuse to follow after the ways of the Jews. He went from that to being a proclaimer, from a persecutor to a proclaimer. He went from an enemy to being a disciple. He was completely immersed into a new life into Christ. That's all his life was about once he became a Christian. All didn't go halfway to the he went all the way. In Galatians, two in verse 20, he says this, I have been crucified with Christ. It is no longer I who live but Christ who lives in me in the life I now live in the flesh. I live by faith in the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me. Paul displays this, this idea of being immersed into a new one. He says that I've been crucified I've been put to death. And it's no longer I who live it's not me who lives I'm not the one calling the shots anymore. I did that As the man of sin didn't, I chose whatever I wanted to do whatever made me happy, please me. But Paul says that, that he was crucified with Christ and it's Christ who lives in him.

Jeremy Sweets  15:13
Oh, that we all could say that, that we are so controlled, so immersed into the new life that it is Christ who lives in us. That is our goal. Well, baptism is immersion into new life. Baptism is also a pledge of allegiance. Jessica, Claire's sick tonight. So she's not here. I'll just mention that real quick. But Jessica asked me, Are you going to talk about Pledge of Allegiance? She saw that on my note and I said, Well, no, baptism is a pledge of allegiance. And when we say those words, there's something definite that comes to our minds probably universe and went to public school recited the Pledge of Allegiance. I pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America, and to the republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all. Well, we state our loyalty to that flag when we state the, the Pledge of Allegiance. Baptism is not a statement of loyalty to any nation, to any man, whether there's really a pledging of our allegiance of our loyalty, of our devotion to God Himself. Baptism is an acknowledgement of the Lordship of Jesus Christ, he is Lord of my life, and I will serve Him. It is a pledge, when one submits the baptism they are submitting themselves and their loyalty. They're doing that as a disciple of Christ. When Jesus commissioned the apostles, after his death, he said, Go therefore, and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father, and the Son and the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you. That's in Matthew 2819, and 20. Notice there that he says that you are to make disciples, they are to be made disciples, what is a disciple? A disciple is a students, one that devotes themselves one that gives themselves over to the teaching of another. And so we are to be disciples of Jesus Christ, we are to be made disciples, so that we come to a point of decision commitments and loyal, we acknowledge Jesus Christ as our Lord. Furthermore, we say that we're going to do whatever you would tell us to do. And so Jesus says, teach him to observe all that I've commanded you. Again, this is a a full proposition where we are to give all of our lives to Him, we are seeking to do all that, that Jesus tells us to do, every bit of it. We don't want to do half, three fourths, it's not good enough to get the majority and leave a few things off our desires to do all things that Jesus has instructed. We're here to observe those to obey the teaching of Jesus. When Paul came upon some disciples from Ephesus, and Acts chapter 19, he found that they had only known about the baptism of John and that's what they were baptized into. It says into John's baptism, but But Paul instructed them about Christ. John was pointing not to himself, he says, but to another one that would come after, and that one is Jesus Christ. And so the text says that they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus. And with their baptism, I believe they submitted themselves to the Lordship of Jesus, they submitted themselves to be devoted to him to be loyal disciples. And so they were disciples now of Christ of Christ. And so we see this idea of pledging loyalty. When we're baptized, that's what we're doing. We're saying, I'm not my own, I belong to another. I am a servant of Christ.

Jeremy Sweets  19:28
Baptism is also entrance into a community. Baptism is an individual decision and commitment that that individual may, but it brings one into a community of others that have made a similar commitment of others that have made a similar decision. Biblical baptism is entrance into a community. We are all united as it says in Ephesians chapter four, we are united by what we share together. Now we may have many doubts differences. The world may see us in many different ways. But we can all come together as the Body of Christ with our our submission to God, having one faith, one hope, and yes, one baptism. When Paul noted the divisions that were taking place in Corinth, he reminded them that they all shared something that made them one body. In first Corinthians 12, in verse 13, he says this, I think I'm starting in verse 12, for just as the body is one and has many members, and all the members of the body, though many are one body, so it is with Christ. For in one Spirit, we were all baptized into one body, Jews are greets slaves are free, and all were made to drink of one spirit. Here we see that we are all baptized into one body. And when were baptized, we are part of a body, a community, a family, of Christians, of those that have named the name of Jesus Christ, Christians are part of that same body today. We're not to live in Division, or competition with one another. This is not about proving who's best or who can be the best. This is about all getting to heaven together. And I love that fact about the church, we are an encouragement to one another, we are seeking to help one another. And we rely on one another, as we all see, to get to heaven. And so we encourage, we edify we strengthen what a blessing that is that God has given us that we can find strength in our brothers and sisters in Christ. Earlier I read from Galatians chapter three in verses 25 through 2727 said this, for as many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ, there is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is no male and female for you're all one in Christ Jesus. And if you're a Christ, then you are Abraham's offspring, heirs according to promise. Galatians three mimics some of that language from First Corinthians chapter 12. There's lots of ways that the world divides us isn't that people say that well, of your of this nationality, or that nationality, you're this race, or that race or you're a male, female, you have this social standing, the world loves to divide us up, doesn't it? But in Christ, we are all worn. None of those things really matter. They really don't define who we are do that. But here he says that we can be one in Christ in Christ. And so those things are external things they don't truly define us. And so we can be united together in our confession of Jesus Christ, relying upon or looking back, I should say to the fact that we all been baptized together. baptism does not discriminate. It's available for all for who so ever will.

Jeremy Sweets  23:17
conversions and acts demonstrate this new community in Christ. In Acts chapter eight, we see that there are a group of people, the Samaritans and they didn't have dealings with the Jews. In fact, they kept separate from one another. Well, the Gospel went not only to the Jews, but it also went to the Samaritans, and Acts chapter eight, verse 12. It says, Philip, as he preached good news about the Kingdom of God and the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized both men and women, despite the difference in their nationality, the Gospel went to them as well. Both men and women were baptized, and they heard about the Kingdom of God. And I love that image as well. In the world, they were divided based upon nationality, but when he heard about the Kingdom of God, God's reign, and his people, they realized that they could be one in that, as they heard the gospel message, the name of Jesus Christ, they were baptized. In Acts chapter 10. The Gospel went to the Gentiles. If you think the Samaritans were separate from the Jews, the Gentiles were either a step further away from the Jews, they were separated and kept separate from one another. But the gospel message went to the Gentiles as well. After Cornelius had been shown the gospel was baptized Peter recognize the extent of the gospel when he stated this in Acts 10 And verse 34. Truly I understand that God shows no partiality, but in every nation anyone who fears him and does what is right is acceptable to Him. God show no partiality, what a wonderful message. We live in a world that's divided. That talks about partiality a lot, we just need to stick with the gospel message and adhere to that. There is no partiality with God and that should be our messages. Well, there is no partiality with with the gospel. There's no partiality in baptism, it is for who soever will. And so we need to listen to those things and accept those things. That the lessons the series of lessons prevented, presented have been been helpful for me to open my eyes, some new connections and things that that I've really not paid attention to. Or maybe I've forgotten, as I even look at this baptism. The points that I make, kind of wrap up some other aspects of the gospel. And as I've presented these almost wondered if I should present each form because they seem to overlap so much in my mind, I was talking to Curtis last week about the lessons. And I've noticed in those first three, that almost every one of them dealt with the mom, the acceptance of truth, almost all of them dealt with the heart and giving oneself over making a commitment of life. And so all those aspects run through faith. It runs through repentance, it runs through confession. And I see all of that wrapped up in baptism as well. Notice that the baptism is the consummation or completion of faith that requires faith, faith leads one to be baptized. It is also the immersion into a new line, which requires repentance, dozens, air requires that we would change the way that we would live. Baptism is also a pledge of allegiance, we can do that by confessing Jesus Christ, by acknowledging his lordship, by understanding who he is and who we are in relationship to him. And it's also infants into a new community there. And so we see this idea of being part of the church. All of these things are important, and they they are woven together, they go together. What God desires from us is our hearts, that we would accept him, acknowledge Him, give our lives to Him. And that can be seen in all of the aspects that we've looked at before all the elements, believing, having faith, repenting, confessing and being baptized.

Jeremy Sweets  27:40
What a blessing it is that God has provided the avenue the opportunity to have our sins washed away. And what we see in baptism is that we can have our sins washed away as it wraps all those things in together we give our hearts to Him, give our minds to him and commit our lives in service to Him. There's someone here tonight, that's not a Christian, you have an opportunity to become a child of God, hearing the gospel message, believing that Jesus is the Christ repenting of your sins, confessing Jesus's Lord Jesus as the Christ, the Messiah, and being baptized in the water for forgiveness of sins. When you do that you can become part of the church, the Body of Christ, so that we can all strive together to get ahead. If you're here tonight, and you're not a Christian, or you are a Christian, and you're not living as you should, you have an opportunity as well to recommit yourself. Reach out to brothers and sisters in Christ, the elders or or another member that you know and trust. Do not hide your sin. Let it be known and seek to move past that and you can do that with help from brothers and sisters and prayers that you might need. There's any subject to the invitation, please come as we stand and sing at this time.
