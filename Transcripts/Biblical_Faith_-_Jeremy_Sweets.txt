Good evening. It's good to see everyone here tonight. Certainly good that we can gather together. I missed being with you last week. But I'm certainly glad to be here today. I'll mention a couple of things before I get into my sermon. One is I've been trying to get Jessica to write my sermons for a long time. She's just never agreed to that. But tonight, I did get my daughter to help me with my slides. So I said, I need this written out all nice and pretty. And she whipped it up and sent it over to me. So Naomi did that for me. So just is still refusing. But the second thing and I don't like to brag, but I have become having four children, a master tent make a master tent maker, especially this last summer, Ezra and Claire really got into the tents and Chloe joined in with that. And so they would get the the cushions from the couch, try to lean those up the right way, put the blankets on top, you know, they tried to situate everything. And so it would always kind of fall down and then there would be weeping and gnashing of teeth. I can't believe it fell. So I had to get involved, right? I had to join in the tent making tents are temporary structures. I'm not the only tent maker, you might remember Paul was also a tent maker. In Second Corinthians five, he used the illustration, in fact of the tent compared to the building. And he said that our bodies are like tents. They are that temporary structure. But there's more than just this tents, we may groan for something more. And he talked about the building that comes from God. So I would like to talk for just a few moments as we get into this text as he talked about that difference. He says, there's really one way though, that we know about this difference. And it is through faith through faith. We know and believe that there is more than this tent. There is more than this physical body because we believe and we have faith in what is to come. In second Corinthians chapter five and verse six, he says so we are always have good courage. Even though our tents our bodies are moaning and groaning and getting older and facing challenges and difficulties. Even though that's happening. We're a good courage, for we walk by faith and not by sides. I'd like to talk for a few moments this morning about biblical faith. What does it mean to have faith, Biblical faith? Second Corinthians chapter five, verse seven, Paul says that we walk by faith, and not by sight. So what does it mean to live by faith and to walk by faith? That's what I'd like to discuss a few moments tonight.

Jeremy Sweets  03:10
First of all, faith is a conviction of mind, a conviction of mine. Faith requires an understanding. In Hebrews chapter 11. And verse one, we talk about the fact that chapter of faith there and Hebrews 11 And verse one, it says this. Now faith is the assurance of things hoped for, the conviction of things not seen, for by the people of old receive their commendation, by faith, we understand that the universe was created by the word of God, so that what is seen was not made out of things that are visible. Notice the solid ground, a stable ground, there have faith. Faith is the assurance. It is a sure thing, it talks about faith is a conviction. And so we see that faith rests upon this idea of an assurance and a conviction. And verse six, he goes on to say, and without faith, it is impossible to please Him for whoever would draw near to God must believe that He exists, and that He rewards those who seek Him. Notice that faith is essential and it consists of a belief that the belief that God is and that God will do what he says he will do that he will keep his word. It's not just saying I believe in some power out there, but we believe in the God that keeps his word that will reward as he says, as we go back to Hebrews 11 verse three, notice that all of this produces for us and understanding It says, Therefore by faith, we understand that the universe was created by this same God that exists, and that will do what he says he will do. And so we come to understand, we come to have a knowledge. And so faith is a conviction of mine. Notice in Hebrews there, that the option object of our faith is not directly observable. Paul says that it is the conviction of things not seen. It's not something that we can take out and test with science, we can measure, it's not something we physically see that is not the basis of our faith. But it is based on evidence. So it's not a blind faith. It's not a jumping into the unknown, but rather, it is based upon evidence. In Romans chapter one and verse 20. Paul says that the creation can be observed, and we can come to conclusions based on what we see in the creation. There it says, For his invisible attributes, namely, his eternal power, and divine nature have been clearly perceived, ever since the creation of the world and the things that have been made. What is it about God that can be understood from the creation, first of all, his eternal power, His eternal power, everything we see, has a beginning. Everything we know and understand has something that starts, so there must be something before us, that starts at all, and it is the eternal God. Not only that, but something must be big enough, powerful enough to abroad this creation, about. And so we see that it is his eternal power, sees the eternal power, and second, His divine nature we look about, we see people and all the things that they can do. But we also see their limitation Don't be a man did not create the world, a man did not create human beings. That's not how all this came about. It was not through a human nature that this came about. But it was rather through a divine nature. Hebrews three in verse four, Paul continues there by saying, for every house is built by someone, but the builder of all things is gone. If you go out and look at a house, you say, I know there wasn't a tornado that simply plot that house down within the order and structure that we see there. If you find a watch, you say, I know this, that and just happened to be someone designed this. And so we look at creation. And the builder of all things is God. He has made all things and so we look at the evidence, and we can become convinced, convicted on what God has done. Furthermore, we see not only the revelation that comes through nature, God reveals Himself something about himself, that eternal power and divine nature. But he will also have another kind of revelation that is where God has spoken to his apostles and prophets. And they wrote those things down so that we can read them today. That's the word of God. And so God has revealed himself through the Scripture as well. First Corinthians two and verse 10, says, These things God has revealed to us through the spirits. Paul is speaking there along with the apostles. And Paul says, God has revealed these things to us. Now notice, he says, and we impart this in words, not taught by human wisdom, but taught by the Spirit. God has revealed it to us, Paul says, as an apostle, and we impart this with words, through the Spirit to you. Paul would later say in Ephesians, chapter four, that he would write these things down and when you read, you can understand. You see, faith has a basis in understanding, becoming convicted in your mind upon the truth that God has for us. In Romans 10 A verse 17. There it says, So faith comes from hearing and hearing through the word of Christ. As we listen to and hear God's were we become convicted, convinced, our faith develops and grows as we see what God has done.

Jeremy Sweets  09:56
Part of God's word involves also I will witness testimony, when we look at Jesus and what He has done, it is not something that that we simply have to blindly accept. We were to go into a court of law to try to establish the events that happen, we would call witnesses and said, Listen to their testimony. And so it is in Scripture, when we want to know about this, Jesus, the Savior and what he has done, we listen to eyewitness testimony in John 20, in verse 30, says, Now, Jesus did many other signs in the presence of the disciples, which are not written in this book. But these are written so that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in his name. Notice that what Jesus did was not accomplished in a vacuum, or in secret, or only at night. Now it was before many other people. His disciples saw much of what he did, they traveled with him. And so it says that he did these things in their presence. And there were also many others around as well. And they relayed these they provided testimony. And some of these things were written down. And it only contains a small portion of what Jesus did. But this is enough. And this has been written, so that you may believe and belief has a great consequence there and then believing you may have life, in his name. And so we see this idea of understanding, having our minds convinced. Understanding is a good starting word, but it's really not enough. I like that word, conviction, right? Because sometimes we talk about like math problems, I understand how that works. But this is more than some kind of intellectual idea. It's something that we become convinced. The understanding is a firm belief, a solid belief. And Ephesians one, verse 818, says, having the eyes of your hearts and lightened, that you may know, what is the hope to which he has called you? And what are the riches of His glorious inheritance in the saints? And what is the immeasurable greatness of His power toward us and who, who believe. Notice that we gain an understanding but notice the way that those things are described. It says that we might have the eyes of our hearts enlightened we may understand, so that we may know there is a firmness there a certainty. And this is not just trivia, you know, we talk about trivial pursue, we have trivia questions, meaningless information. This is the opposite of that isn't, this is not meaningless. But notice what we are to know. He says that we are to, to know what is the hope that we have the future direction of our life, we are to know the riches of His glorious inheritance. And we are to know the immeasurable greatness of His power toward us. Again, that's not trivia, or trivia. But that is great and outstanding. And that's what he has provided for us. In Second Timothy three in verse 14, we we need to have the kind of faith that Paul mentions in this passage. But as for you continue in what you have learned, and have firmly believed, and that's the kind of faith we're talking about a conviction, a firm belief. And when we talk about this firm belief, it is the kind of belief the kind of conviction that will propel us forward into action. Again, it's not a matter of trivia, but it is the direction of our lives. We believe this so much, we are willing to follow it. In Second Corinthians five verse seven, it says For we walk by faith, not by Stein's the understanding of faith is not learning the answer to a single puzzle or a piece of trivia or having a single piece of knowledge. But it is an understanding that orients our life, it's a worldview it's how we see the world. So Paul is not just talking about taking a Sunday stroll or a walk one day, it is the walk of our life. We walk by faith. Our our view is oriented toward God so that it directs the way that we live our life and that is faith. It is a conviction of mind, a conviction of mine.

Jeremy Sweets  14:56
Not only a conviction of mine, but it's also a trust. of hearts, a trust of heart. Faith involves the conviction of mine. But it's more than an individual understanding or even the individual determination that one might make. There is more than just an individual involved when it comes to faith. Faith is a relational term. And so there is a relational component to faith that requires trust of hearts. Trust is, it is a belief in something it is putting faith in something. Our fault, faith is bolstered by evidence. But it's not just an accumulation of facts. Our faith is in a person, namely, God, the Father and His Son, Jesus Christ through the Spirit. And so the faith that we have is a trust in God, a trust in God. In Proverbs three in verse five, there it says, Trust in the Lord with all your heart, and do not lean on your own understanding, in all your ways, acknowledge him, and he will make straight your pants. Be not wise and your own arms, fear the Lord, and turn away from evil. Notice that the trust we have we are to place in God, He is the one that is provided for us. And so we see faith to find something is a firm belief and the reliability, the truth, the ability, or the strength of someone or something. That's what dictionary.com says. And so trust is all of those things in God, we believe that he is reliable, that he is true, that he is able and he has all the strength that one could have. Faith includes what we believe there is a conviction of mind. But it is much more than that. It is about who we believe in who we believe in, in second Timothy one in verse 12, says, but I am not ashamed, for I know whom I have believed. And I am convinced that he is able to guard until that day what has been entrusted to me. Notice the faith there the assurance, that conviction there, it is convinced in God, and what he is able to do. And that moves us forward. We believe in God. We believe in his character, we trust his character. And so we trust him. So let me just remind you a few things about what faith is not in faith is not in the church. Now that doesn't diminish the church in any way. God, the one we trust wants us to be a part of the church. And so it's very important. But that's not where our trust is. We don't trust the church. The church is a collection of people. And you know what we may fail from time to time, as individual Christians and as people as part of that church. And so we trust God, we trust God, our faith is not in popular opinion. It's not a matter of taking a poll. And what do most people say? What is the prevalent idea out there? We hear a lot about popular opinion, right? One person likes it and they share and guess what they do they share this news story picks it up and feels like all we hear is popular opinion. That's not where our faith rests. Our faith does not rest in science or in human knowledge, even the collective human knowledge all throughout history. As we build upon one another. That is not where our faith rests. Our faith does not rest in military mind of any one single nation or of all of them combined. Our faith does not rest in ourselves. Our faith rests in the person of God, His Son, Jesus Christ, and His Holy Spirits. And so we see that we are to have faith, trust in God and His Son Jesus Christ. When the flippin jailer asked what must I do to be saved, he was hold, Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be safe. Have trust trust Jesus Christ. And John three in verse 16 says, For God so loved the world that He gave His only Son that whoever believes in Him, you see that component of trust in a person. Whoever believes in Him shall not perish but have eternal love.

Jeremy Sweets  19:48
Trust is in the person of God and Jesus, His Son. In John 11 In verse 25, Jesus speaks about the resurrection He says, I am the resurrection in the life Whoever believes in me, though he die, yet Shelly wood, and everyone who lives and believes in me shall never die. Do you believe this? She said to him, Yes, Lord, I believe that you are the Christ, the Son of God who is coming into the world. And so she announced and confessed her faith, her trust in Jesus. And that is what is necessary for us as well. Let me add one other point about this. And that is we can trust in God, because God is trustworthy. We don't normally just pick a stranger off the street and say, I'm going to trust you. Why don't we do that? Well, we have, we don't know that person. We haven't seen how they act or how they behave, we don't know their character. And so we don't pick a stranger and say, I trust you. But with God, we can see and begin to understand his character, and it is a character of reliability. I've selected just a few passages in the songs that talk about trust. And notice how it uses this language. It talks about trusting God because of his character. Trust is rooted in God's character, and he has shown himself to be trustworthy. And Psalm nine and verse 10. And those who know your name, put their trust in you for you, oh, Lord, have not forsaken those who seek you. God is reliable. He has not forsaken anyone. We see in Psalm 52 And verse eight, I trust in the steadfast love of God, forever, and ever. Notice the use of trust and God and His character. I trust in God's steadfast love that he will continue to have steadfast love. I do not doubt that. I don't call that into question because everything I've seen from God has shown and displayed steadfast love. In Psalm 62, in verse eight, trust in him at all times, oh, people pour out your heart before Him. God is a refuge for us. God has shown himself to be a strong, a protector of those who are in the gods or refuge. His character displays this in Psalm 115, in verse 11, you who fear the Lord, trust in the Lord, He is their help, and their shield. God provides protection. So the trust we have is in God, and it's because he is trustworthy. He has always shown himself to be trustworthy, without fail. As we come back to second Corinthians five in verse seven there it says, For we walk by faith, and not by sides. One of the themes are the theme that we have this years holding God's hand. And so when we talk about walking by faith, and that we walk by faith and not side I like the image and the picture of walking hand in hand, with God, walking hand in hand with the Savior and the walk that we live the life that we live, should be by faith, living with him, trusting in Him, relying upon Him, for we walk by faith, and not by sides. A third aspect of Biblical faith is the submission of will the submission of will.

Jeremy Sweets  23:42
Faith requires conviction of mind. It involves a trust of hearts, but it is more than that. It is something that must be demonstrated. And James two in verse 14, it says this, what good is it my brothers if someone says he has faith but does not have works? Can that faith safe him, for brothers or sisters poorly clothed and lacking in daily food and one of you says to them, Go in peace be warmed and filled without giving them the thing needed for the body? What good is that? So also faith by itself, if it does not have works, is dead. Faith is intended to be active, it requires action. Almost think about it. Have you ever seen those little windup toys is setting they're not doing anything, but if you wind it up, that propels it and springs it into action. That's what our faith does for us. It it winds us up and it moves us into action. It is what propels us forward. It is what gives us the energy and the strength and the determination to serve God with all of our minds. By our faith, we act in faith and service to Him. So we see that we are to be an active people. Faith is not just any action, the the action that is required is service to the master, and acknowledges Jesus as Lord. And again, this is one of those descriptions that's not compartmentalized. Jesus is Lord of Sunday in my life. No, well, he's that but not only that, Jesus is Lord of me when I'm not watching sports. Jesus, Lord of me, but you know what I need my me time you know, my hobbies just for me, I'll give him the rest. Now, when we acknowledge Jesus as Lord, that is a whole life determination. In Romans 10, in verse nine, all states that if you confess with your mouth, that Jesus is Lord, and believe in your heart, that God raised Him from the dead, you will be saved. The confession is of the truth that Jesus is Lord, but it's also a very personal truth. Jesus is my Lord, the Lord of my law, and I submit to Him. And so we see the need to serve the master. And Hebrews five, verse nine, it says, And being made perfect, He became the source of eternal salvation to all who obey Him, Jesus Christ became perfect, giving Himself on the cross, being raised from the dead, and sit at the right hand of God, and He is the source of salvation. And it is for those who would obey Him. And so we see that faith requires submission, the submission of a serpent. The type of submission that is required is often described as giving one's life. Again, I've tried to point out this is not just a portion of one's life, but is a complete giving of self. In Galatians, two and verse 20. He says, Paul says, I have been crucified with Christ. It is no longer I who live but Christ who lives in me in the life I now live in the flesh, I live by faith in the Son of God who loved me and gave himself for me. The language of that passage is powerful, isn't it? Paul there says that I have been crucified with Christ crucified is to be put to death. I've been executed my life and my will has been put to death. And I've done that with Christ in such a way that I no longer live, it's no longer what I want to do. I'm not calling the shots doing what makes me happy. You see the point there, but rather, it is Christ who lives in me I follow after his will, what he wants from me, and that life is a life of faith. That's what faith is to give up ourselves, and to completely Serve the Master. In Matthew 16, in verse 24, Jesus told his disciples, if anyone would come after Me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me. Brother Swofford. Talk about that, taking up that cross that wasn't an easy matter was, but that's what Jesus requires of all of us is that we would deny ourselves and go and serve him. Give up what we want, and serve him That is faith. That is faith, a complete submission of our will, so that we follow after Him and DO what He would have us to do.

Jeremy Sweets  28:42
In Second Corinthians five in verse seven, it says, For we walk by faith, not by sight, when we walk by sight, we often do what we want. We have to figure things out. Everything is up to me and my ability and we walk by sites, you know, in some ways, we're comfortable doing that. You know, some of us are OBO control freaks. We like to have exactly what we can see and know and know that I'm in control. We fool ourselves there don't we hear? We think we have more control than we really do sometimes. And even if we don't we try to say I'm walking by side I can see and I can know and it's all up to me. But Paul says the Christians don't live that way. They don't walk by sides. We walk by faith in God, who is truly in control, and we submit our will to him, and we walk by his son. walking by faith and not by sight requires a conviction of mind, a trust of heart, and a submission of will may conclude by simply saying this, that faith is not optional for the Christian. It is not something that we can buy Pass are is not simply reserved for those that are the devoted Christians, it is essential for every single one of us. And Hebrews 11. In verse six, it says that, without faith, it is impossible to please Him. Faith is necessary to please God. And so we should seek to have the kind of faith we find in Scripture. In Ephesians, two in verse 10, it says, For by grace, you have been saved through faith. Faith is necessary for salvation. If we hope to be saved, to have our sins washed away by the grace of God by the blood of Jesus Christ, then we have to have faith in him, and what he has done for us. And faith is a way of life defined by the reality of God and His purposes. In Second Corinthians five in verse seven says, For we walk by faith, we live by faith, and not by science. Do you have Biblical faith I hope that you do. I hope that we're growing in that and growing more and more. If you're here tonight, and you're not a Christian, you have an opportunity to develop that faith, look to Scripture and and obey the gospel message, which involves believing that Jesus is the Christ repenting of your sins, confessing Jesus as Christ and being baptized in the water for forgiveness of your sins. If you're here tonight, and you are a Christian, but you're not honoring the commitment, you may, which is a lifelong commitment, meaning you're not living up to what you said you would do. You also need to make changes and there's no better time than right now. If you're subject to the invitation, please come as we stand insane at this time
