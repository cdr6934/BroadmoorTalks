Unknown Speaker  00:18
So it's good to see you all.

Jeremy Sweets  00:22
You know, I understand the, the trouble that some family members of preachers face, you know, they are always thinking, don't tell that story on me. I tried to I tried to save my family, my kids from too many stories. So I have to tell one of myself. When I was in college, we had a fall break and I decided with a bunch of guys that we were going to go around the Everglades. So we were near Tampa area, you go south, you know, around around Panhandle there last month, a painting around the South go around the Florida. So we take off, we're all talking, we're all goofing around. And a couple hours later, we say wait a minute, where are we? Well, this was before GPS, I had headed north. And we were all talking and we didn't even realize it for a couple hours. And so after a couple hours, we're like, okay, we need to turn around, we were going the wrong direction. And we needed to turn around. Paul did some turning around in his day as well. In fact, it was a lot more consequential than my little turning around. We were so upset, not really, we decided just we stopped and watched the high school football game that was two hours north. So we said well, we'll just go ahead and do this. And x 26. Paul does a more consequential turning around x 26. He relates his conversion. And this is actually the third time it's recorded in x. And then Paul is talking to Agrippa. And he talks about the time that he turned, turned the direction of his life. After he saw a bright light, it says that he falls to the ground and he hears a voice that says to him, why are you persecuting me. And he says, Who are you, Lord, and Jesus identifies himself. And it's at that time that he commissions Paul saw at this time, but he would change his name to Paul and he says this in verse 16. But rise and stand up upon your feet, for I have appeared to you for this purpose, to appoint you as a servant and witness to the things in which you have seen me and to those in which I will appear to you, delivering you from your people and from the Gentiles, to whom I am sending you to open their eyes, so that they may turn from darkness to light and from the power of Satan to God, that they may receive forgiveness of sins and replace among those who are sanctified by faith in me, notice Paul's mission. First of all, this would be the time in which he would turn change the direction of his life. But the commission that Jesus gives him is this, that you're to go and preach the word proclaim it so that you might open the eyes, particularly of the Gentiles, so that they may turn from darkness to light, and from the power of Satan to God. The turning here is repentance. In fact, as he is talking to Agrippa, he says that I obeyed the commission that Jesus gave me. And he says to Agrippa, that he talked to the Gentiles that they should repent and turn to God, performing deeds and keeping with their repentance. Last week, we talked about biblical faith. And I use Naomi's slides there. I got her to design some more for me. So this week, we're going to talk about biblical repentance. What does it mean to repent, or one of the key ideas that we've already talked about is a turn, it is a change in direction, I was going north. That's not the direction I needed to go. So I had to turn and go south. Paul was putting Christians in prison. And when he saw the Lord, he recognized that was not the direction he needed to go. And so he turned and went a different direction. And not only that, he began to preach and proclaim to all everywhere, that they should repent, that they should turn away from darkness to light away from the power of Satan, to Jesus Christ. As we look at this idea of biblical repentance, one of the fundamental concepts is that idea of turning but how does that play out? Well, let's notice a few ways in which we see biblical repentance used.

Jeremy Sweets  04:52
First of all, biblical repentance is a sorrowful heart, a sorrowful hearts and this sorrow Heart includes first of all, and acknowledgement of sin. Admitting that we have sinned is really the first step. In alcoholics innominate anonymous, you have to admit that you're an alcoholic. And that's the first step and being able to move forward being able to deal with the problem for until you can say that I have this problem, you can't move forward. And so it is was sin until you can acknowledge your sin, you cannot truly repent. When it comes to our sin, we tend to do a lot of things, except admit it, we tend to hide it, conceal it, minimize it, deny it, or we distribute the blame to other people. Everyone is at fault, except for me. It's like we become a season politician where we can twist the circumstances to make ourselves look good. But biblical repentance requires acknowledgement of sin. You might notice in Scripture, there are several people that were notorious blame shifters, moving the blame away from themselves, they they failed to acknowledge their sin. Adam, when he was confronted with his sin, do you remember what he said? He said the woman. It was the woman that gave me the fruit. Not only that it was the woman that you gave me. God, you're partly to blame for all of this,

Unknown Speaker  06:26
says Adam. Well, God asks,

Jeremy Sweets  06:30
even she says, The devil made me do it. It was the serpent's that deceived me. And then I Yes, I did this, but there were extenuating circumstances. There were things out of my control. Aaron was a notorious blame shifter, wasn't he? He said these people after he had made the golden calf It was these people. Their heart is set on the evil, he says. And after they had given him all the gold, and they were at fault, somehow out pop this golden calf. He was the one that had made it and crafted it. But when you listen to his words, he had nothing to do with it. He was an innocent bystander. And isn't that how we treat sin? We want ourselves to looks good so much before others, we often deny it to ourselves, that yes, we are sinners, we have to add a qualification and excuse a reason. We very rarely say that I have sinned and stop right there. There's a reason for my sin, and it's not my fault. Another notorious blame shifter. Moving away from himself is David. David went down a whole maze in order to get out of the sand that he had committed with Bathsheba. When he impregnated Bathsheba, he recalled her husband Uriah from battle, to come and be with her so that that could conceal the fact that he had committed that sin with her. But Uriah did not lay with his wife because he was concerned for the battle. And so David has to turn again, he thought he had solved his problem and hidden his sin, but he has to take another step into deception. And so he ends up sending Uriah her husband to the frontlines and puts him to death, essentially murdering him and he's unraveling and unraveling anything but acknowledge his sin. David, though, had not lost all sense of justice heavy. When Nathan the prophet comes to him, and tells him the story about a rich man that had all the lamps that he could want, but he saw one poor man with a lamb and he took it. And David's indignant at the injustice of that. And then Nathan says, You are the man. You know, it's, it's easy to identify the sin of others. But it's much more difficult to identify that in ourselves, where we acknowledge our sin. We can deny and make excuses and shift blame all day long, but we find something in someone else and they we immediately are indignant at the injustice of it all. But David, to his credit, was convicted by Nathan the prophets. And you'll notice in Second Samuel 12 And verse 13, and 1112 is that story in verse 13. He says this, I have sinned against the Lord. And I find it very important that that sentence is so short. He doesn't. He no longer adds a qualification, or an excuse, he stops right there. And he says, I have sinned against the Lord and that's exactly what we need to do. We need to acknowledge our sin and stop right there. Don't make excuses Don't add a qualification. Don't add a denial or point the finger at someone else but acknowledge our sin. And when we acknowledge our sin that should lead us to great sorrow.

Jeremy Sweets  10:13
That should pain our hearts that we have done that in Psalm 51. The title of Psalm 51 says it's a Psalm of David. And it was given after his sin with Bathsheba. And in that Psalm we see that David expresses a sorrowful heart over what he had done. In verse three and four, it says this, For I know my transgressions, and my sin is ever before me, against you, you only have I sinned and done what is evil in your sights. And the sorrow here of David sin was that he had sinned against God. He had caused God great pain. Paul mentions this sorrow also in Second Corinthians seven in verse nine. There he says, As it is, I rejoice, not because you were aggrieved, but because you were aggrieved into repenting, for you felt a godly grief, so that you suffered no loss through us. For godly grief produces repentance that leads to salvation without regret, whereas worldly grief produces death. We see that there are different kinds of grief different kinds of sorrow. Sometimes we're sorry, aren't we in the midst of sin, but we're sorry that we were caught. Or we're sorry that we have to face the consequences. And that's not the kind of sorrow that we're talking about. It's not sorry that I have to deal with a bunch of trouble now because of what happened. It is sorrow over the sin that was committed, and that was committed against God the Creator on who is wholly impure, that is the sorrow it is a godly sorrow. And biblical Repentance involves a sorrowful heart. A sorrowful heart must also be coupled with a humble spirits. I humbled spirits, David showed this humility in his repentance, after he stated the words that I have sinned against the Lord. He accepted the consequences of his actions. He didn't fight and kick and scream against that. In fact, he announced the consequences what happens should that what should happen to that man, you remember that he should pay restitution fourfold, and almost feel like David had to pay that restitution over his life. The rest of his life was dealing with the consequences of the the difficulties of his children as the last the son the one that Bathsheba gave birth to there. You see Amnon you see Absalon a dog? got thrown now Adonijah is what's coming to mind. I don't think that's right. She's whispering to me, but I can't read lips. David sons, he faced the challenges there didn't. He faced the challenges. It is Adonijah I've got it written down. I just see it. Right. I was right even though I was wrong.

Jeremy Sweets  13:14
So we see that David showed humility even in his repentance. In Psalm 51, in verse 16, he says this, For you will not delight in sacrifice, or I would give it you will not be pleased with a burn offering the sacrifices of God or a broken spirit, a broken and contrite hearts, oh God, you will not despise. The NET Bible translates that broken and contrite heart as a humble and repentant heart. And that's what God wants from us not to just sorrow over sin, but that that would bring us slow that we would be humbled and recognize God's greatness, and are we our need for him. You know, sometimes it's really the time when we are humbled in our circumstances that we are more able to acknowledge this as sometimes we have to shift our circumstances and the humility we find there to to our hearts. I think this is what the prodigal son did. The prodigal son went to his father and demanded his inheritance before the time. And when he had his inheritance, he went out and lived a righteous life. He lived in parties and had lots of friends around at the time doing everything that he could want. But that money dried up didn't and so that his friends, so that he was left there with nothing, and he was feeding the pigs. Pigs were considered unclean to Jews. And so that's what he was left with a life with the pigs a life of nothing. And he was humbled wasn't he? And Luke 15 Number 17, though it says this is But when he came to himself, he was in those humble circumstances, but he came to a realization didn't. His poverty of experience struck his heart so that he humbled his own spirits. Sometimes it takes a while to get there, doesn't it? We hit rock bottom that our spirit doesn't know it and we're resisting and we're fighting. But here the prodigal son came to himself and how often that's exactly what we need to do. When it comes to biblical repentance, to recognize and realize our our humble states. A humble spirit recognizes one's unworthiness and God's worthiness. It is a spirit that depends completely on God with sometimes saying, I need the every hour. And so it is for biblical repentance, a humble spirit that acknowledges God and our need for him. Not only does biblical repentance include a sorrowful heart and a humbled spirit, but it also includes a changed mind, a changed mind. The turning of repentance requires that that includes our mindsets that our mind would be turned away from what we have done. The Greek word for repentance can literally be rendered after mind or a change of mind it is a turning a shift, a change. The new interpreter's dictionary describes this repentance as the complete reorientation of one's whole being to God. The reorientation, a different outlook, a different way to see things, a change a turn. Jesus talks about this change of mind in the parable of the two sons. He asked this question to the Pharisees, they're the religious leaders, what what do you think, Man has two sons. And he went to the first and said, Son go and work in the menu today. And that son answered and said, I will not. But afterward, he changed his mind and whence the King James version uses that word there changed his mind and mentions repented. New American Standard, and Ivy says he regretted it. And so we see this change of mind. And then the other son, he says, I will go, he set the expectation, but then he did not follow up and which one obeyed Which one did what he should do? Well, it was the first son. And so Jesus said to those, those Jewish leaders, truly I say to you, the tax collectors and the prostitutes go into the kingdom of God before you, because you did not afterward change your minds and believe him. You did not change your mind you did not turn to where you needed to. Repentance demands and involves a changed mind.

Jeremy Sweets  18:12
Repentance also includes an amended life, an amended life, a sorrowful heart, and a changed mine are not enough by themselves. Repentance must also be accompanied by amended life. We can see this in Matthew 27. This is one of the best examples of stopping short of repentance. Here we see Judas. And he sorrowed over a sin. He changed his mind. But he did not display the kind of dependence that he needed upon God. After he had saw that Jesus was betrayed and what was going to happen? I'm not sure if he did not realize the extent of what would happen or if just seeing it unfold. He was sorry that that had happened. And he went to the chief priests there, and he wanted to return the money. And do you remember what they said to him? They said, See to yourself. Well, that's a common mentality, isn't it for us? We want to see two things ourselves. And we do that by shifting blame. It's not me. We try to take control in many different ways. We'll do everything and anything except depend upon God. Well, he did see to it himself. He did not rely upon God in that circumstance, and he threw the money out, and he went and hanged himself. He saw to it himself. Repentance, though, requires more than being sorrow for your sin more than a change of mind. It includes an amended life a changed life. We can see this for example, in Acts 26 And verse 20. That was the passage we started with and in verse 20, as Paul's talking to Agrippa. He talks about performing deeds In keeping with repentance that was the message that he proclaimed repentance accompanied with deeds that are associated with that repentance. When the Jews came to be baptized by John the Baptist, there was a similar message there. In fact, he asked them, Why are you coming out to be baptized? This is in Luke chapter three. It's not enough he says to be a descendant of Abraham. But you must also in verse eight bear fruits and keeping with repentance, bring fruits in keeping with repentance. They continue to ask John the Baptist about repentance and what does it mean? What shall we do the Crown's asked that and we see that in verses 10 through 14 He provides an answer. He said Whoever has to tunics is to share with him who has none. And whoever has food has to do with likewise become sharers not just takers, not just Steelers here, but share what you have. Well, the tax collectors asked the same thing and he replied, collect no more than you're authorized to do. He told the soldiers do not extort money from anyone by threats or by false accusation and be content with your wages, to see to truly repent, we have to change our life, our way of living. And so we see it includes a sorrowful heart and a humble spirit. We are regrets we repent, we change from the sin that we have committed. But it involves a turning into a new direction, a new mindset, a new determination to follow a different path and amended life so that we would live in a different way. You might remember Zacchaeus, he offered fruits of repentance. When Jesus came to his house, he said that he would take no more than is required, he was a tax collector. And if he had taken too much from anyone, he would restore it or provide restitution for fault. This was not a hallow desire on his part, but it was shown to be complete or fulfilled by his changed life. He was backing up his desire to change and to turn. And so we see he provided an amended life.

Jeremy Sweets  22:23
So in conclusions, we look at biblical repentance. I want to just talk about two things here. First of all, if you're not a Christian, if you're not a Christian, you have an opportunity to repent tonight, and give your life to God. And acts 14 And verse 15. When the people of light Illustra came before Paul and Barnabas they they said to him that or that the people there said, You're gods. And Paul says, No, we are not gods. We are men of a nature like you. And we bring you good news that you should turn from these vain things to a living God turned from these vain things, these vain idols, and that's what we have an opportunity to do tonight as well. Turn from the vain things and that may be idols, idols in our hearts covetousness that may be the vain things of line, adultery, the vain things of anger, lust, envy, pride, turn from the vein, things of this life and to the living God. That's what we must do if we repent. You can do that by accepting the gospel message, believing that Jesus is the Christ repenting of your sins and being baptized in the water for forgiveness of your sins. If you are a Christian, but you've not been living as you should, you need to repent and return to God. And so it's not just a turning but a return. That's what Paul Peter said in Acts chapter three, Repent therefore, and turned back that your sins may be blotted out. We are living in sin. That's exactly what we need to do as well repent and return. Thankfully, God is not a vindictive King seeking to execute us at the first opportunity. The God is a loving Father, that is waiting and wishing for us to come back into repent. He desires our repentance that we would come back to him. Won't you bring joy to His heart and repent this night? If needed? There's any subject to the invitation. Please come as we stand in saying at this time
