Good morning. It's certainly good to see you. Good to see everyone here. I hate that we're not all together. But it is good that we can see each and every one that's here and we kind of shuffled around. So we we see a few different people, maybe every week. Bragging is a part of the human condition. And it has been a part of every culture and civilization really that has ever existed. Some of the oldest writings that we have are of bragging as kings would boast of their military exploits, or their wealth, or the longevity of the rain, their building projects. Boasting has been a part of every culture. And I'm sure you're aware of the fact that our culture our country is not immune to boasting. It's found on the playground. It's found in the workplace, it's found on the sports field, it's found in the home. It's found in the church, it is found nearly every place you go, and this may be a big shock to you, but it's also found online. And in fact, as people vie to get attention, they've made an art out of boasting, and bragging. One article on less pin greenie.com is entitled The best article ever written about bragging. And it lists 17 different ways that that people brag, and it defines. It defines bragging as personally imposing what you to be what you believe to be status, elevating thoughts on your audience, building yourself up, making yourself look good. I'm not going to go through all 17. But here's a few of the ones that he identifies as ways of bragging. There is the bare bones basic brag. And then this an individual simply responds with a brag. One person responded to a question about how they would handle a situation by saying I'm a very smart person, and then continued to talk about what they would do. There is the one upmanship brag. We're all familiar with this. If someone tells us something we have to better it. I am extremely tired. I only got four hours of sleep last night. Oh yeah, I'm more tired. I only got two hours of sleep. And so we up them by one. There is the humble brag, which is a boast disguised within a humble statements. I hate getting pulled over for speeding, I guess I should have bought a Corolla instead of that new Lamborghini. Putting that boast within a humble statement, you know, it's hard going through the airport when everyone's asking for your autograph. That's so difficult. And then there's the beneficence brag, and this often comes from parents. It's when you offer advice and you couch bragging within it. You know, the reason your child can't walk is because you're carrying them around all the time, my child was walking at seven months old. And so there is the rug within advice. And there are many more that are listed there. But what we see that is that people are constantly bragging, there is a constant boast. And although we find it repellent, when we hear it often, we find ourselves doing it as well. And I think it's for that reason that Moses addresses the subject in Deuteronomy, chapter eight, Deuteronomy, chapter eight, and nine, so that's going to be our text this morning, as we look at boasting, and really boasting before the Lord, for God hears all things. And it's for this reason that I decided to present the best sermon ever presented on the subject of boasting.

Jeremy Sweets  04:15
First of all, notice in Deuteronomy, chapter eight and verse 17, Moses presents a warning. He says, Beware, lest you say in your heart, my power, and the minds of My hands have gotten me this well. Now Moses is on the eastern side of the Jordan River as they prepare to enter into the land of Canaan. The land of Canaan is the land of promise. It's the land of plenty. When the spies enter into the land, they came carrying grapes on their shoulders that were that were very large and so they saw the wealth of the land and this is the land that Moses is preparing the people to enter into. And so he says that when you go into that land you need to take care. And you need to be aware lest you say, unless you boast, my power and the mind in my hand have gotten me this well, you'll notice, first of all that he says, notice or be aware that you boast in your hearts. We often want to boast before others, but sometimes we keep that thought even to ourselves. But he says, Beware of that. Beware of even making a boast in your heart or saying to yourself, for that, as I mentioned before, is heard and seen by God. God sees and knows our hearts. And so he says, simply Beware, beware of boasting in one's strength. Jeremiah extends this boasts to include not only one's strength, or physical power, but also to wisdom and wealth, in Jeremiah nine and 23. And 24. Thus says the Lord, let not the wise man boast in his wisdom, let not the mighty man boast in his mind, let not the rich man boast in his riches. And so both are made often today about our physical ability, you'll see sports athletes, sports athletes, they will boast about what they can accomplish what they can do, they're the best ever. And so they grabbed the headlines by boasting over their opponents. You see, boasting within one's heart and before others about educational accomplishments, I've had this much school, I have this mini degree. And so both are made before others. We see people boasting of their wealth, and they got their wealth, I say, from the hard work, and many years of hard work that they put into it, look at all that I had. Again, our country is not immune to boasting. In fact, we are people that talk about pulling ourselves up by our bootstraps, as long as you can do it, and look what I've done when we accomplish it. And so we boast about our strength, about our wisdom, about our wealth. But Moses says, Be aware that that happened to you be aware that that happened to you. He also says that there is a boasting in righteousness. Now, as Moses fills us out, he says that, when you come into the land, you're not going to be the most numerous, you're going to be able to overtake nations mightier than you. And so Israel may be able to realize that they're not the strongest nation, but maybe God is giving them the land because they're the goodest, the most moral, the most righteous nation, God has given this land because I am a better person. We are a better nation than you. Notice in Deuteronomy, chapter nine in verse four. Do not say in your heart after the Lord, your God has thrust them out before you. It is because of my righteousness, that the Lord has brought me in to possess this land. Do not say and do not think in your heart that you are a better people, that you are morally superior. In fact, he's going to point out that ever since you came out of Egypt, you have been an unrighteous people, a stubborn people, ascending people. And we can fall into that same trap today and can't we were in this building, and they are not. We come to services three times a week, we give of our money, we do what's right and good. We are simply better people. Christians of all people are susceptible to this, why? That we are better people. And we begin to forget our sin, and the fact that we have sinned, and we simply think that we are better people.

Jeremy Sweets  09:11
In Matthew chapter six and verse one, Jesus talks about the motives of practicing righteousness. And he says, Beware of practicing your righteousness before other people in order to be seen by them. And so often we do the things we do that are right, but not for the right reason, or not with the right motive. And Jesus warns against that. Do not practice your righteousness in order to be seen by them. The prohibition is not against practicing righteousness, but practicing righteous with righteousness with faulty motives. This ingenuous, ingenuous motives, and so he says, do not practice your righteousness in that way. In that way. regard, I think these are both that we need to be careful about today as well. They can. They can be found in the Christian very easily and we need to be aware, we need to be aware. Well, in Deuteronomy, we see that that God was preparing the people for entering into a land of blessing, a land of great wealth. And he did that through their trek through the wilderness. And Deuteronomy chapter eight and verse two, he says, And you shall remember, you short, remember the whole way that the Lord your God has led you these 40 years in the wilderness, that he might humble you, testing you to know what was in your heart, whether you would keep His commandments or not. He continues on in verses 336, as he talked about, God humbled you by by letting you be hungry, and by giving you manna. And God was teaching the important lesson that man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that comes from the mouth of God. Our life does not consist in what we eat, but who we follow, and following after God, and he says that your clothes did not wear out, and you had sandals on your feeds. It was a difficult time as they traveled, but God was still providing for them, even though it wasn't the abundance they would experience in the land. But God says that He did this so that he might humble them, so that he might test them and test their hearts. Today, we can find training in trials training in trials. In fact, our faith is tested when we face trials as well. When we face trials, it's almost like a refining fire that refines our Fe refines our character. In first Peter one in seven. It says in this you rejoice, though now for a little while, if necessary, you had been grieved by various trials, so that the tested genuineness of your faith, more precious than gold that Paris's notice tested by fire may be found result in praise and glory and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ. And so we face trials that are of faith can be tested so that ultimately, we can bring praise and glory to God and that we can receive those things when Christ is revealed. And so we need to understand that there is a point to difficulties. There is a purpose in trials. And we see this purpose in James chapter one, verses two through four. And James one, verse two, he says, counted all joy, my brothers. Now as I begin that statement, you may be familiar with the passage and know how to fill that out. But if I simply made that statement, you would probably begin to fill that out with your own thoughts. Consider it all joy when the weekend comes, Consider it all joy when, when you graduate, consider all all joy when you're able to retire. But that's not what James says, Don't consider it joy simply when you've accomplished. But you need to consider the process of getting there as a statement of joy. We would never on our own simply say Consider it all joy when you face challenges, integrate when we have troubles. We don't normally think like that. And that's because we see things from a human perspective, we can only see the here and now. And if that's all there is it is only trouble. But from a divine perspective, if we step back and look at the whole process, we see that this trial serves a purpose and developing our character so that we can get to Heaven one day. And so we don't say thank you for Monday's but you know, we wouldn't have that weekend without the Monday. And we don't we don't say thank you for homework. I'm

Jeremy Sweets  14:08
glad I'm loaded down with homework. But it's without that homework, we would not be able to graduate. And so we see the benefit of trials. So as James finishes the statement, he says counted all joy, my brothers when you meet trials of various kinds, for you know that the testing of your faith produces steadfastness. And let steadfastness have its full effect that you may be perfect and complete, lacking in nothing. We don't enjoy hardships to be and trials, but we endure them so that we can grow and be in heaven one day so that we can be complete. Maturity does not come without the struggle. No pain, no gain. And so we see the benefit of trials, even though they're not enjoyable. They serve important function and enforce important purpose. And so just like the Israelites, we can be trained by trials. And we can be trained in trials knowing that, that there is a great temptation in abundance. There is a temptation in abundance. And Deuteronomy chapter eight and verse seven, he says, For the Lord, your God is bringing you into a good land. And in verse 10, a few verses later, he says, And you shall eat and be full, you're going to have everything that you could want everything that you need. And so notice in verse 11, as he issues the warning, take care, lest you forget the Lord's you're gone by not keeping his commandments and his rules and statutes which I command you today, less when you have eaten and are full, and have built good houses and live in them. And when your herds and flocks multiply, and your silver and gold is multiplied, and all that you have is multiplied, then your heart will be lifted up. And you forget the Lord your God who brought you out of the land of Egypt, out of the house of slavery. Moses says, Be careful when you have wealth. Wealth is a great blessing from God. But it's also a temptation to turn away from the one that gave it to us. And this is a message we need to hear in this country. We are a wealthy people. And we have a tremendous amount. And that is a blessing from God, but it's also a temptation. And so we need to be on our guard. We need to be on our guard that wealth has not made our treasure that it doesn't become the point of life. In Matthew chapter six and verse 19. Jesus says, Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal. But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven, where neither moth nor rust destroys and where thieves do not break in and steal. For where your treasure is there your heart will be also.

Jeremy Sweets  17:08
We live in a country where we're continually comparing ourselves to others. And as people boast online, we see their boasts and we want to have what they have. And so we get into this rat race of trying to outdo each other. But that is not the point of this life. The goal is not to outdo your neighbor. And if that is your goal, that's a sad goal that will lead in a dangerous place. Wealth is not our treasure. Because what's going to happen to wealth and what does happen to wealth? Well, it fades, the moth get in the rust destroys and wealth goes the way of the world. But a treasure that is laid up in heaven will not be defined, will not be destroy. It is reserved in heaven for you. So let us be careful about making wealth, our treasure, our goal. In First Timothy six and verse 17. Paul says, As for the rich in this present age, charge them not to be haughty, nor to set their hopes on the uncertainty of riches, but on God, who richly provides us with everything to enjoy. Our certainty is not found in wealth. And here he says that people that are rich will often set their hope. They will set their their goal and what they are counting on the uncertainty of riches, instead of the certainty of God. And we most certainly must be aware of that. The problem is once we make that our treasure, and once we attain those things we often look to ourselves as the source. And so we boast, we boast in our accomplishments. This is exactly what Nebuchadnezzar did. And Daniel chapter four, as he was walking on the roof of the royal palace of Babylon, he said this is not this great Babylon which I have built by my mighty power as a royal residents and for the glory of my majesty. Nebuchadnezzar looks around and says, I did all this. And it was at that very time that he was humbled and walked around like an animal on all fours eating the grass. God humbled him and he made him eat his own words, didn't he? When he said, I am the greatest and everything I have is because of me. He had forgotten about the Lord and forgotten about God. When we boast in self The truth is that we leave little room for God. Psalm 10 and four says in his pride the wicked man does not seek him All his thoughts, there is no room for God. If we are responsible for all things, and we don't have any room for God, we don't leave any place for him, we see ourselves as the one that has made all things. And so there is a great temptation in abundance, and we must be aware of that temptation.

Jeremy Sweets  20:23
So what what is the answer to all this? Well, it's not to boast in self, but rather it's to boast in the Lord. And Deuteronomy, chapter eight and verse 17, we'll go to the warning, beware unless you say in your heart, my power and the mind of my hand have gotten me this well. You shall remember that the Lord your God, for it is he who gives you power to get well that he may confirm His covenant that he swore to your fathers, as it is this day, as Israel entered into the land of Canaan, they needed to be weary and beware of taking credit for the land. They needed to remember that it was God that was providing them with all of these things. God was the one that they needed to boast. God was the source of their strength. And first Chronicles chapter 29, in verse 12, David recognizes this as he brings his offerings before the Lord. And instead of saying, look at all the wealth that I am bringing to you, he recognized where the wealth came from. And he said this, both riches and honor come from you, speaking of God, and you rule overall, in your hand, our power and mind and in your hand, it is to make grades and to give strength to all. The truth is any strength that we have any wealth that we have, any wisdom that we have is given to us by God, the one that has all strength, in all wisdom, all power, and all minds. It comes from God. And we need to remember where our blessings come from. Let us not take credit, but let us boast in God, who is most certainly great. Not only that, but the Lord provides salvation or provides righteousness for us. God is one that has not sinned and will never sin, his character is pure, there is no blemish upon his record, there is no black mark. We can't boast in our righteousness before God because we are sinners. That was the message that Moses gave to the Israelites in Deuteronomy, chapter nine and verse five. Notice what he says, Do not say in your heart after the Lord your God has thrust them out before you it is because of my righteousness that the Lord has brought me in to possess this land. Whereas it is because of the wickedness of these nations that the Lord is driving them out before you. It's not because you're so good, but this is actually a judgment that God is bringing upon those nations. Now in the next verse, He goes on to talk about now you need to remember your own sin, and the fact that you have sinned from the time that God brought you out of Egypt, even to this time. And Moses reminds them of the sin they committed it at Mount Sinai, and the sins that they committed on the journey. They're in the wilderness. They were a stubborn and rebellious people. They need not take credits for being a righteous person or righteous nation. And yet again, for the people of God, this is a strong temptation, that we would say, Look how good we are. We often talk like the Pharisee when he prayed before the Publican Thank God, I thank God that I am not like other men extortion is unjust, adulterers, or even like this tax collector. Thank God that I'm not a borscht. inist I don't, I don't murder people. I don't sleep around. I'm glad I'm not like them. And as we say that that's a boast and an arrogant boast. And what we've simply done is overlooked our own sin may not be the same issues that others deal with. But the truth is, is that we have sin, we have sinned, and we have the potential to sin again. And Ephesians two verses eight and nine. For by grace you have been saved through faith and this is not your own doing is the gift of God, not a result of work so that no man may boast. When God saved us by His grace as a gift that was graciously given to us, he left us no room to boast We can't look him, we can't look at him and say you owe this to me. I deserve this. We can't say that I have earned salvation.

Jeremy Sweets  25:11
But we can only say thank you for giving me what I have not earned. Thank you for being gracious and calm. Salvation is not something we can boast about. But something we can simply fall upon our face. And thank God who is the great giver. And so we see that the Lord provides salvation. And because of this, because he is our strength and the giver of all blessings, because he provides for us salvation and rescues us from our own iniquity. God must be our boast in First Corinthians 127 through 31. God talks about the stumbling block, the foolishness of the cross of Christ, who had believe in a savior that that died, that was put to death that didn't have the power to overcome. So many people said, but But Paul reminds them that God use the foolish things. He says in verse 27. But, but for God, what is foolish in the world, he put the shame the wise, God chose what is weak in the world to shame the strong. God chose what is low and despised from the world, even things that are not to bring to nothing things that are so that no human might boast in the presence of God. And because of him, you are in Christ Jesus, who became to us wisdom from God, righteousness and sanctification and redemption. So that as it is written, let the one who boasts boast in the Lord, the only boast we can make is of our great God, not in ourselves, our confidence needs to be in our Lord, not in ourselves, he is our boast. And Jeremiah 923, and 24. And when he says, let not man the wise man boast in his wisdom, the mighty man boast in his mighty nor the rich man boasting his riches. We saw that earlier about the things that we can boast in. Jeremiah continues by saying, But let him both let him who boasts, boast in this, that he understands and knows me, that I am the Lord who practices steadfast love, justice, and righteousness in the earth. For in these things on the light declares the Lord. We can take confidence in knowing God, that is our boast, and we take that boast before others, our great God can accomplish great things. And so we brag on him, not ourselves, we boast in the Lord. And so we see that our boasting should not be in self, but in God. So let us put all things in perspective, as we consider this, we need to consider our relationship before God. Often when we boast, we say I am so great, I have accomplished so much. But when we see ourselves in relation to God, it's very difficult to boast. When we dwell upon his greatness and His Granger. It's very difficult to books. In first Peter five and six, it says, humble yourselves, therefore under the mighty hand of God, and He will exalt you at the proper time, when we consider God's might. We can't help but humble ourselves and lower ourselves because we don't compare in the slightest. We have there is no comparison between God's strength and power and mites and ours. And so when we think about him, we can't help but be humbled. And so Peter says, humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God, we need to put things in perspective regarding others as well. In Philippians, two, verse three, do nothing from selfish ambition or conceit. But in humility, count others more significant than yourselves. We do a lot of focus, focusing and bragging on ourselves and what we have accomplished. But Paul says, Don't put yourself up so high, but rather consider others as more significant focus on them and

Jeremy Sweets  29:24
how you can encourage them. We also need to consider ourselves in relations to others and that we are all in need of God. Now, it may be by a process of maturity that we've been able to grow, but we need to remember where we have been. We have sinned before God and so we need not look at someone that has not had the opportunity to grow yet or is there at the beginning of their journey, or if they haven't even started and say I'm better than them. We can't say that. We have been blessed with opportunities and Blessings and we've taken advantage of those hopefully, but let us not look with this deign upon others that may not have had that opportunity yet or may not have had the advantages that we have, instead of looking down upon them, let us consider them as significance and see what we can do to help. See how we can encourage, see what we can do to point them to God, let us seek to provide encouragement rather than discouragement. We also need to put things in perspective with ourselves. In first Corinthians 10, verse 12, it says, Therefore lead anyone who thinks he stands take heed, lest he fall, when we begin to think that we're impenetrable, we can't fall there's nothing that's going to happen to me we get that Superman complex, right? Well, Superman had kryptonite than in a weakness, our weaknesses, sometimes our pride, we need to recognize the fact that we can sin. We have sin and the potential is always there, that we would turn away from the Lord. The potential is always there that we would become so proud and arrogant that we would fall into the trap of sin. When we think that we are above sin, that's the exact time that we need to prepare ourselves for a fall. So let us put things in perspective. Let us not boast and brag, except in the Lord and His goodness. It may be that there's someone here this morning, that's not a Christian, you've not made God your boast. He wants to be your God and He wants you to be His child. You can do that by believing that Jesus is the Christ repenting of your sins and being baptized in the water for the forgiveness of sins. When you humbly submit yourself to God, he readily accepts you and you can be His child. If you're here this morning and you started along that journey, but you're not living as you should. God wants you to repent and make a change so that you can continue on and you can be in Heaven with Him one day. If there are any that are subject to the invitation. Please come as we stand and sing at this time.
