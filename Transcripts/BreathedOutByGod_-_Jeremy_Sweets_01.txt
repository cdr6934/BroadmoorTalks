Good morning. Good to see everyone here certainly good that we can gather together and worship our God. I truly appreciate mental and see each and every one of you. I've been encouraged to yours by each one of you and it's always good to worship together. I think you begin to recognize that more and more if you have some time apart, right, which which we have had a little bit you know, one of the things with Coronavirus, it's led us to think about things that we haven't thought about before, or at least I haven't thought about before. We're thinking a little bit more about our breath, aren't we? How far that breath travels and the particles in there, we want to be careful that we're not infecting someone else, if we haven't. The dangerous thing about the Coronavirus is that you may have it and not even realize that you have it. So something that's inside of you could be spread to someone else. And so we mask up don't we we guard our breath so that we're not sending that out. When I look in Scripture, there's that's another place that I notice the breath is something that we don't often think about, but one of the places we see breath is when it comes to Scripture itself. And that is the fact that it is breathed out by God. Now we're worried about spreading a virus, something that is inside us. But here it's a positive thing, because something that is inside of God, the very mind of God can be spread and given to us and it is a life giving thing, rather than something that is destructive. God's breath as it is breathed out. Notice if you would in in Second Timothy chapter three verses 16 and 17, second, Timothy, 316, and 17. There it says in the ESV. It says all scripture is breathed out by God. It comes from within God and it is breathed out he is the source of Scripture. He is the one that is giving the Scripture, we know that our breath comes from with inside us. And so we have to be careful if we have that virus of spreading it. But here it says the Scripture is breathed out by God. It comes from God Himself. He is the source of Scripture. And so when we read the words in our Bible, we can know that ultimately that that those words come from God, they are breathed out by him. Now that's a little bit different than maybe some of the translations that we have grown up with the New American Standard. That's the one that I grew up with says that all scripture is inspired by God. And often we'll think about the the process of how the Bible came from God to us. And so we think about the men, the the men that were involved were inspired, that means that God breathed into them. And so they were inspired. And the Scripture reveals that process. And I think we see some concept of that, for example, in Second Peter chapter one, it talks about men that were moved by the Spirit of God. And so men play a part in bringing to us the breathe out word of God. But I don't think that's the best translation here. It's not so much talking about the men that were inspired, as the book that is expired or brief doubts. And so we see that God's word comes from his mind, it is breathed out by God. And because it comes from God, it is a very unique and special book. And it provides for us great benefit. And so God's word is breathed out. You know, it's a pretty amazing thing when you think about it, that God has spoken to us. In Hebrews chapter one and verse one, it says God after he spoke to the fathers long ago in many portions in many ways, and these last days has spoken to us, by or through or in his son. If you boil that sentence down, and that sentence actually keeps going for a couple more verses, you see three words at the heart of it. God has spoken.

Jeremy Sweets  04:45
God has spoken. What an amazing thing that the creator of the universe, the King of all kings has spoken to us. And if God has spoken to us, we most certainly need To listen, I'm reminded of what the psalmist says in Psalm eight, verse four, what is man that You are mindful of him and the son of man that you care for him? You know, the same statement could be spoken about the words of God? Who are we that you would speak to us? You are so great and mighty, and we are so small. Who are we that you would speak to us? If God of the universe speaks, then we most certainly should? Listen? Can you imagine the President and his busy schedule, taking the time to sit down and write a letter to you? Are the Queen of England that has all these people as their subjects sitting down and writing a letter to you? Would you take that letter after they've handwritten it and just throw it in the trash? Not even read it? No, certainly not. If someone of significance like that would write a letter personally to you, then you would read it? Well, here we have the breathe out word of God, for us, and so we should take the time to read it to understand it, it is breathed out by God and He is the source. You know, another thing that we see in Scripture is that there's actually quite a bit of conversation of God's breath. You might not notice that. And as we see what it says about God's breath, we see what God has the power to do himself. And also notice that what God has the power to do himself is also found through his word. For example, notice that God has the power to create in Psalm 33, in verse six is it describes the creation in the beginning in Genesis one, it says, by the Word of the Lord, the heavens were made, and by the breath of his mouth, all their hopes, God breathed into the world, all creation, it came from his mouth, and as he spoke, it came into existence. And as he breathed, that it was created. God's word can accomplish the same thing. In Second Corinthians five, verse 17, therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation, the old has passed away, and behold, the new has come, we can be created a new through the word of God, God has the power create, and it makes sense that his word has the power to create, as well. We also see that God has the power to give life. In Genesis two and seven, then the Lord God formed the man of dust from the ground and breathed into his nostrils, the breath of life, and the man became a living creature. And so we see that God has this power to animate or to give life and we see the same thing of His Word. Notice again, that God is bringing life and Ezekiel chapter 37. There we have this picture of, of dry bones, of deadness of dryness of a lack of life. But as AQL sees a vision where God brings life to the situation through his breath, it says in verse one, and I'll skip around a little bit here, but I'll be reading from verses one through four.

Jeremy Sweets  08:39
The hand of the Lord was upon me, and he brought me out into this in the spirit of the Lord and sent me down in the middle of the valley. It was full of bones. And he said to me, Son of man, can these bones live? And I answered, oh, Lord, God, you know, then he said to me, prophesy over these bones and say to them, oh, dry bones here, the word of the Lord, Thus says the Lord God of these bones, Behold, I will cause breath to enter you and you shall live. And as I prophesied, the bones came together, but there was no breath in them. Then he said to me, prophesied to the breath, Prophesy Son of Man and say to the breath, Thus says the Lord God come from the four winds or breath and breathe on the slain that they may live. So I prophesied as He commanded me and the breath came into them, and they lived and stood on their feet and exceedingly great army. Then he said to me, Son of Man, these bones are the whole house of Israel. Behold, they say, our bones are dried up and our hope is lost. We are indeed cut off. Therefore prophesy and say to them, Thus says the Lord God, Behold, I will open your graves and raise you from your graves, oh my people, and I will bring you into the land of Israel. And you shall know that I am the Lord, when I open your graves and raise you from your grave, so my people, and I will put my Spirit within you and you shall live, and I will place you in your own land, then you shall know that I am the Lord your God, I have spoken and I will do it declares the Lord. Notice that God takes these valley of dry bones, and he reads his spirit, a life giving spirit into them, so that they have life. And it uses the language so that they have breath. And so you see that God has the power to give life and he does that through his breath, through what is within him. God's word has that same power. In Matthew four in verse four. There it says that man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds from the mouth of God. God can breathe into his life and we can attain that as we listen to and live by His Word. Second, Peter, one in verse three also says, His desire, his divine power, has granted to us all things that pertain to life and godliness. And so we see that we can have life from God through His Word, God has the power to give life and so does his word. God's breath also has the power to lay bare, to expose that which seeks to be hidden. In Psalm 18 And verse 15. When David cried out to help the God he says this, then the channels of the sea were seen and the foundations of the world were laid bare at your rebuke, oh, Lord, at the blast of the breath, of your nostrils. God is so mighty and powerful and big, even his breath can lay bare, here mountains and those that seek to hide, God has the power to lay bare and to expose. And Hebrews four in verse 12, it says, For the word of God is living an active, sharper than any two edged sword, piercing to the division of soul and spirit of joints and of marrow, and discerning the thoughts and intentions of the heart. And no creature is hidden from His sight, but all are naked and exposed the eyes of Him to eyes of Him to whom we must give an account. God has the power to lay bare, there is nothing hidden from him. Poor Jonah thought he could run in hot, but he couldn't, could he, and neither came away. God sees and God knows. And so it is of His Word, we may try to hide our heart or shuffle our hearts so that no one else can see. But when we come to God's word, it has the ability and the power to expose our thoughts and intentions. And ultimately, we will have to understand that it is exposed before God.

Jeremy Sweets  13:06
Not only that, but we see that God has the power to bring judgment. And He does this by his breath. And Ezekiel 22 And verse 19. There it says, Therefore thus says the Lord because you have all become dross. Therefore, behold, I will gather you into the midst of Jerusalem, as one gather silver and bronze and iron, and lead and tin into a furnace, to blow the fire on it in order to melt it. So I will gather you in my anger and, and my wrath, and I will put you in and melt you, I will gather you and blow on you with a fire of my wrath, and you shall be melted in the midst of it, as silver is melted in a furnace, so you shall be melted in the midst of it. And you shall know that I am the Lord, I have poured my wrath upon you. You see the imagery here of a furnace. And if you've ever had to build a fire, you know that you're going to have to give that some oxygen, you're going to have to blow on that to expand that fire. And so it is with God's judgments. Israel here says that

Jeremy Sweets  14:13
they will be gathered together and they will be put into the furnace and God will breathe into it. Judgment so that that fire has red, hot, God will bring bring judgment, and he'll do so by his breath. In Second Thessalonians, two and eight says and then the lawless one will be revealed whom the Lord Jesus will kill with the breath of his mouth and bring to nothing by the appearance of His coming. When God comes as he speaks for the word of life, it's also a word of judgment to those that reject Him. And here it is for this one of lawlessness that the breath of God's mouth will kill him. Put him to death, make him as nothing. And so you see the great power in the breath of God. In John 12, verse 48, not only will he killed the man of lawlessness, but he will bring to judgment. All people in John 1248, the one who rejects Me and does not receive my words has a judge, the word that I have spoken will judge him on the last day. And so we see God's breath in Scripture is quite powerful, isn't it? And God's word is an extension of God himself. The breathed out word also has the same power of God Himself. God's breath is certainly powerful. Well, let's go back to Second Timothy, I tried to expand and look at God's breath in scripture. But let's go back to Second Timothy, chapters three and four. And notice there are some benefits of the God breathed word. Scripture is certain ensure powerful and profitable because it comes from God Himself. He is the source. And as we look through these chapters, I think we see many benefits. First of all, God's word is profitable for teaching and doctrine, profitable for teaching, and doctrine. In chapter three, in verse 16, it says, All scripture is breathed out by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training in righteousness. That word teaching is sometimes translated for for doctrine. It is what is can be taught. When we teach others we want to teach them what is right and true. And when we teach from God's Word we can count on that. It is right and true, because it comes from God himself who cannot lie. There is no error in God, there is no misunderstanding, there is no accident, God is certain. And sure, now, if you begin to teach the doctrines of men or the psychology of men or the the thoughts of our society, you will likely be wrong. Now they may was they say, a blind squirrel finds a nut every once while there may be some truth and things that people say. But when it comes to God, it is always true. And you can count on it. It is profitable for teaching for doctrine. He goes on to say that as we teach, we can also reprove or God's word can reprove. That is to remind or to confront with what is true, there may need to be a correction there, which is the next word, as someone follows a course they may need to alter that course to align themselves with God. And God's word can correct can change the course so that they're following after God. And as we're, we see that we can be trained in righteousness. An athlete takes a regimen of training, that is that they, they're careful about what they eat. They're careful about the exercises they do. And they do that with a goal of accomplishing what they're desiring to do. They have a goal in mind. And so they're going to train themselves, they're going to do the same action so that they can be prepared to do that in the game or in the sport. And so it is for Christians. We train ourselves in righteousness. We practice righteousness so that we can do it time and time again, so that we can continue on that course. And God's word is profitable for that. We need God's word.

Jeremy Sweets  18:50
Not only that, but we see that God's breathed out word challenges, error. And that makes sense. If it teaches truth, it's automatically within his very nature going to confront and challenge error. In chapter three in verse 12. It says, Indeed, all who desire to live a godly life in Christ Jesus will be persecuted, while evil people and imposters will go on from bad to worse, deceiving and being deceived. He received that, that those that do not follow after God's word, that reject His word, they follow a path of evil that only descends into more evil, and that same evil will persecute those that are doing right. And so you see this confrontation between truth and error. Those that are in IE, then those that are in error, and following after evil will reject and persecute those that are doing right. And so just by doing what is right and living a godly life and speaking the Word of God, we may we We will face a backlash, won't we? We will face people that reject what we have to say. But that's what truth does. It challenges air. And sometimes as Gil talked about in our class, sometimes even a silent sermon can can enrage others, just by how we live. Just by the choices we make to do what is right, it can make others upset, and angry. Truth has that effect. As we move on through the text, we see that truth can be God's word can be a guide, from our youth, leading us all the way through our life. In Second Timothy three and verse 14, Paul says to Timothy, but as for you continue in what you have learned and a firmly believed, knowing from whom you have learned it, and how from childhood, you have been acquainted with the sacred writings, which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus, the sacred writings, the Scripture, the breathed out word of God, All scripture is breathed out by God, that is something that can guide us from our youth provider, a concrete path, a clear path, that Northern Star, the compass that points us in the right direction, from our youth, all through our life. It is a guide into what is right, it is a guide into what God would have us to do. And we need to follow after that God, those that were trying to navigate, you know, they would often use the stars, what if someone said Why don't want to follow the stars, I don't want to follow the guy, I don't want to use my compass. Well, they would end up off course and loss with me. So it is for us today. If we're not following the guy and we are lost. If we're not following the guy. We also see that God's word equips us it gives us what we need. It trains us in righteousness, and then we are equipped for the very purpose for which we were made. And that is to do good works. In verse 17. It says that God's word is profitable for doctrine for teaching, verse 17, that the man of God may be complete, equipped for every good work. The goal of a Christian is to, to do that which is good in order to glorify God, to do good works, which we have been created for before the foundation of the world. And as we seek to do those things, God's word equips us for that. It gives us the necessary tools, it points us in the right direction. It teaches us and equips us for that work. When you're on a job you need to receive on the job training, training that will help you do the tasks that you're being hired to do. And that may involve the tools and involves knowledge about how to get there involves all of these things so that you're equipped to do your job. God's word equips you to live the Christian life. You're equipped to live the Christian life by following after God's word.

Jeremy Sweets  23:36
Not only that, but we also see that God's word tests, discipleship, it tests discipleship. Being a disciple is all about denying yourself and submitting your will to the Lord. When we become a Christian, that's the pledge we make. I will serve you and not myself. That's what discipleship is. But God's word test that discipleship and that commitment. In chapter four and verse to begin in verse two. Paul tells Timothy, preach the word be ready in season and out of season reprove, rebuke, exhort with great patience and instruction. He says in verse three, for the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine, but wanting to have their ears tickled, they will accumulate for themselves teachers in accordance with their own desires, and will turn away their ears from the truth and will turn aside to men's God's word will test discipleship and that means that if you do not want to submit your will to him, then you're going to turn away from his word. You're going to turn aside to what you want to having your ears tickled to whatever makes you feel good, not necessarily what's right or what you need. But what you want reminds me of discussion of diet, you know, parents and children are continually having that discussion, aren't they? What is the child wants to eat? Well, if they could choose their meal, a retirement would be something like cotton candy, right? Or nerds. My kids love nerds. That's a little candy if you're not familiar. And so children love those things. But that's not what's good for them. That's not a healthy diet isn't. And so parents, eat your vegetables, eat your meal, eat that. That is, the treat is something saved for later. And so we see that it is with God's word, it tests our discipleship because it gives us what we need. And the question is, are we going to submit to what we need? Are we going to reject that and simply seek out cotton candy? What we want something that will provide no nutritional value whatsoever for us, it does not give us the strength we need. What choice are we going to make God's word tests our discipleship? Will we choose to follow after God's will? Or our will? That is the question. We also see that God's word prepares us for the challenges of life. Paul and Timothy had a very special relationship. In fact, Paul was Timothy's spiritual father, having taught him in the faith and they had a close relationship. But Paul says that he was about to depart. He was about to die. And he wrote Timothy encouraging him to continue in the faith to continue to serve Him. They had a close relationship and that the death of Paul certainly would have been a point of sorrow for Timothy. But Paul tells Timothy, continue in the word continued to follow after God's word. And I think it prepares us for those challenges when we lose loved ones when you face sickness, when we face heartache, God's Word, God's word can be a source of comfort and strength for us in those times. God's Word also leads us to heaven. It leads us to heaven. Paul says that I fought a good fine, I've finished the course I've kept the faith. Paul was nearing the end of his life. And he says in verse eight, henceforth, there is laid out for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord the righteous judge will award to me on that day, and not only to me, but to also all those who have loved as appearing. Paul was an amazing man that was devoted to God, but heaven is not reserved just for Paul, just for the Apostle Paul says, Yes, I'm included. After I've lived a godly life, I'm included in that reward, but it's for everyone.

Jeremy Sweets  28:01
That means you. That means me. If we would live a life of discipleship and service, having run the Christian race of faith, having finished the course, fought, the fight was Satan's so that we can overcome if we will rely upon God within that journey, then we can have the reward that awaits us. In verse one of this chapter, it says that Paul makes his charge before God who is to judge the living in the dead. God is the judge. And one of the benefits of God's word is that it can lead us to salvation. We saw that in chapter three in verse 15. Paul says that, Timothy that God's word is able to make you wise until salvation. And as we come to chapter four, verses seven and eight, we can have the crown of righteousness, it's laid out for those that would follow him. But let me tell you that the benefit of God's word is only for those that choose to follow it, that choose to submit themselves to it. God's Word is a benefit, but it's also going to be a point of judgment, for those that reject it. And so God will judge the living in the dead, we must make the choice of whether we're going to follow God's word, or reject. Again, I asked you the question, the President, the Queen of England or someone that you respect someone that you love, takes the time to write you a personal letter, what are you going to do with that letter? Are you going to throw it away? Are you going to read it? Well, God of the universe has written you for spoken to you and we have his words. Let us read them. Let us read them often. Let us read them with love in our hearts. Let us read them with an attitude of submission. Let us read them with humility so that we follow after what it says rather than what we won't let us read them and read them often. So that we can be like Paul. And at the end of our lives say that I'm ready to attain the reward that awaits me. This morning, we've talked about God's Word and God's word points us to Him and do what we need to do in response to him in order to have a relationship with Him so that we can be in heaven one day, if you're not, if you're here, and you're not a Christian, you have an opportunity to believe the gospel message, believe that Jesus is the Christ, to repent of your sins. And that means to turn away from selfishness and sin and submit to God and to His will. confessing that Jesus is the Christ and being baptized into water for forgiveness or remission of sins. If you're not a Christian, you can become one. And that's a great thing. You can be a child of God. Everyone wants a family. And you can have a father, a heavenly Father, that loves you and cares for you. All you have to do is submit to Him. If you're here this morning or even listening online and you're a Christian, but not living as you should. You need to make your life right. Honor the commitment that you made at the beginning when you became a Christian, and you may need to rededicate recommit. You may need help from brothers and sisters in Christ, and we will pray with you and for you, whatever the situation is, do not leave here today without making your life right. There's any subject to the invitation. Please come as we stand and seeing at this time
