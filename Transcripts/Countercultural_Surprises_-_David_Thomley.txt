Unknown Speaker  00:01
Thank you very much for being here tonight. And thank you for letting me have this opportunity to come and be with you tonight. It's a pleasure to be back with you. It's been a long time since I have been here. And I'm glad to be back. We live on the other side of the war zone. As you know, I've told someone one time traveling through Nashville is like fighting a battle every time you have to cross cross the city, especially if you're traveling in the morning or in the in the evening, when everyone else in Nashville seems to be trying to travel at the same time. What it's, it's great to be back up on this side of town. And it's great to see all of you, thank you so much for your kindness. And thank you for the invitation to come and talk with you about Jesus and the Gospel of John. We're going to be talking about some countercultural surprises and some countercultural realities as a result of our Lord being countercultural, but I want you to go back all the way to the beginning. As you recall, in Genesis chapter three, when the sin had occurred, and God has confronted the man, the woman, the serpent, with the sin that has been committed, he said to the serpent, I'm going to put enmity between the and the woman between thy seed and her seed, and he shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel. We look back at that now. And we say, well, that was the first messianic promise in the Bible. And I believe that it was. And yet, someone's quick to point out that's, it's somewhat ambiguous, don't you think? I mean, he said, I'm gonna put enmity between the and the woman, but you're speaking to the serpent between thy seed and her seed. Yeah, Genesis 315, we don't see very clearly who this seed is going to be. But we find out in Genesis chapter 6789, it's going to be also through the family of Noah, that this is, this seed is going to come. And then in Genesis 12, we find out well, it's going to be also through the seed of Abraham, that this seed is going to come. And then we find out as we continue in the book of Genesis, and we get toward the end of the book with Jacob and his 12 sons, that it's not only going to be from the family of Abraham, and then Isaac, and then Jacob, but it's going to be someone from the tribe of Judah. Then little by little, the picture, just gradual gradually comes into focus. We get to the prologue of John's gospel. And John said, In the beginning was the Word. And the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God, all things were made through Him. And without Him was not anything made. That was made. In him was life. And the life was the light of men. And the light shines into the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it. And the beginning was the Word. And this word John said, became flesh and dwelt among us, and we beheld his glory. glory as of the only begotten of the Father, full of grace, and truth. Word became flesh and tabernacled among us, that's the word. He dwelt among us.

Unknown Speaker  04:27
John was baptizing. And as he saw Jesus coming to him, he said, Behold, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world. This is he of whom I said, After me comes a man who ranks before me because he was before me. I myself did not know him. But for this purpose, I came baptizing with water, that he might be revealed. to Israel. Jesus, Jesus as He closed himself with flesh and blood and he walks among Israel of the first century. He was not in any way. What those Jews were expecting in the coming Messiah, he just wasn't. There were so many things about him that were just different. I mean, can can we just say that there's a very real sense in which it in the religious community in the community of faith and the first century Jesus was just odd among them. It wasn't like them. It didn't fit in. And so, as you begin to look at the Gospel of John, you're going to see just how odd how strange how counter cultural. He really is he and John the second chapter after the wedding feast at Cana, he, he comes to observe the Passover in Jerusalem. He went up to Jerusalem and the temple he found those who are the sellers of animals, the money changers in the temple. Wow. He did something that nobody else had ever done before. And he drove them out of the temple. And then the John the third chapter, Nicodemus comes to him by night, and Jesus is says something to Nick even Nicodemus does, it doesn't get it that you want to be you want to be my disciple, you want to be part of the kingdom, you must be born again. Then in John, the fourth chapter, the Holy Spirit tells us through the pen of John, that Jesus now is passing through Samaria. And he's come there for a reason. The disciples go into the city to buy food to buy bread, and this woman comes out and she comes to draw water and that and she's not just any woman, she's a sinful woman. Well, first of all, Orthodox Jews didn't go through Samaria. Secondly, Jewish men did not speak to other women in public. Nor did other women speak to a man who was not her husband, in public. And thirdly, it is not just that Jesus is in Samaria, and he's speaking to a woman, but this is a sinful adulterous woman. I am saying to you that in his behavior, as he has come to gather souls into the Kingdom, Jesus is as counter cultural and individual, as his generation had ever seen. And John, the fifth, Fifth Chapter, he's healing a paralytic on the Sabbath, gets him in all kinds of trouble with the establishment there. And John, the sixth chapter, they're coming after the feeding of the five deaths, and they're going to make him king by force, you are going to be our king, we're going to make you are king. No, this isn't a political endeavor. And I'm not here to fill up your bellies with food. And he refused it. In the eighth chapter, the woman who was caught in the very act of adultery, to hurt Jesus showed

Unknown Speaker  09:10
compassion and forgiveness and the 10th chapter, as he's talking to them about the good shepherd who will lay down his life for the sheep. And he contrast himself with the imposters and those who are hirelings. Then he had the audacity to say, I and the Father are One No wonder they took up stones to kill him. And the 13th chapter on the on that last Passover night as he's gathered in that upper room with the disciples as Jimmy Corrigan said and his comments on this passage on this particular night, he said, when they gathered in that upper room to eat this last Passover, there were 12 lords, and one servant. No one had done the work of the domestic who would meet the guests at the door with a towel and a basin of water, and one by one wash their filthy feet. Before they came in, to recline at the table, Jesus washed the disciples, feet. And then in John, the 15th chapter, he just reminds them, you, you're not going to live like the world, you're not like the world, I'm calling you out of the world, you're going to be different from the world. And he says in verse 18, If the world hates you, you should know that it has hated me, before it hated you. If you were of the world, the world would love you as its own. But because you are not of the world, you're you're not part of this culture. You are in a very real sense, counter cultural, because you're not of the world, but I chose you out of the world. Therefore, listen, therefore, the world hates you. Remember the word that I said to you, a servant is not greater than his master. If they persecuted me, they will also persecute you. If they kept my word, they will also keep yours. But all these things they will do to you on account of My name, because they do not know Him who sent Me. If I had not come and spoken to them, they would not have been guilty of sin. But now they have no excuse for their sin. Whoever hates me, hates my father. Also, if I had not done among them the works that I did, that no one else did, they would not be guilty of sin. But now they have seen and they have hated both me and my father. And the word which is written in their law must be fulfilled. They hated me without a cause. Jesus said, I want to tell you, in a very real sense, you need to be paying attention to what's happened to me, to the way the world has reacted to me, to the things they have said to me and the things they have done to me, because if they have hated me, they will hate you also, if they have persecuted me, they will persecute you. Also, if you were of the world, the world would love you as its own, but you're not of the world. You've been called out of the world. And Jesus from the very beginning of his ministry to the end, he was one countercultural surprise after another, he just never fit the bill. He never conformed to their idea of what this messianic figure was going

Unknown Speaker  13:50
to be. Now, if in fact, we are the disciples of Jesus, there's some things we need to learn. And there's some things we need to understand about what it means for us if we are being conformed into His image. That's what God is doing with us every day molding us, making us refining us, shaping us day by day to be more like Jesus. Romans eight and verse 29. Isn't that what we're predestined to be conformed to the image of God's Son? And in Romans chapter 12, the apostle Paul said, I'm begging you by the mercies of God, to present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God which is your spiritual service. And do not be conformed to this world. But be ye transformed. How? By the renewing of your mind aimed, so that you may prove what is the good and acceptable and perfect will of God. Don't be conformed to the world. Don't blend into the culture that is around you. Jesus has called us to something that is far greater and far better. And there is a price to be paid for living that life. The first thing I want to say to you, as Jesus was emphasizing to His disciples over and over again, he's saying that I'm calling you out of the world. I'm calling you into the kingdom, the apostle Paul would say in Colossians one, that we have been, we have been called out of the kingdom of darkness translated into the kingdom of the Son of His love.

Unknown Speaker  16:00
Jesus said, I'm calling you to be different. Come ye out from among them, and be separate, saith the LORD, and touch no unclean thing I will be under you a father, and you shall be unto me sons and daughters, the entire, the entire concept of this is the concept of being separated. That word holy, that word saint, it has everything to do with what we're talking about tonight. I've called you out of this world to be separate, to be distinct. To be Jesus said, like me. But Jesus warned His apostles. I'm calling you to the high road. But it's not the easy road. Being different, is not easy. John, the 17th chapter. And that prayer that is truly the Lord's prayer. Jesus said, beginning in verse number 14, he said in his prayer to his father, I have given them that is His apostles, I have given them your word. And the world has hated them.

Unknown Speaker  17:40
Because they are not of the world, just as I am not of the world. Now want you to notice very carefully, verse number 15.

Unknown Speaker  18:00
Because Jesus said clearly, and unequivocally, I do not ask that you take them out of the world

Unknown Speaker  18:16
but that you keep them from the evil one. They are not of the world just as I am not of the world. That amazing. Jesus said to his father, in the prayers, he's come to the end of his ministry, His death is in front of him it it's all coming to his climactic point now, the cross and the empty tomb. And he said to his father, I've accomplished what you want, I have given them Your Word, and the world hated them.

Unknown Speaker  19:02
And then Jesus said, I don't want you to take them from the world. I want to say something to you tonight. I don't know if you've noticed or not. Sometimes if you turn on the news, you you'll hear a negative broadcast.

Unknown Speaker  19:25
I really think Christians would do well sometimes. Just to turn all that off. And I want to tell you something about about politics and about wars and rumors of wars and nuclear things and all of that a long time ago. Before there was a cold war before there was a hot war before there was a nuclear bomb a long time ago. God was seated on his throne in heaven. And he was the ruler of the heavens and the earth. And to my knowledge, as best I can tell, from all of my studies

Unknown Speaker  20:24
My God still sits on the throne. He hasn't moved. He's not going anywhere. So I said, Aren't you concerned about this upcoming? How many elections? Have we heard this?

Unknown Speaker  20:43
How many times? Just how much drama can we generate? A long time ago, during the days of Isaiah, there was a pro Egyptian party, there was a pro Syrian party, there was a pro a Syrian party, there was even a pro Jehovah party and Isaiah is what are you people thinking? You're thinking you're going to be saved by creating some alliances, some political strategy is going to be the key to your survival, and the happiness and the welfare of your kids. That's not so and I want to say to all of us tonight, there is no government, no ruler, there is no earthly thing that is the key to our success and survival as God's people. It is the Lord God himself, who has redeemed us with the blood of His own Son, He is the one who lifts us up. And he is the one that takes care of his people. And he is the one who feeds the birds of the air, and he closed the grasses of the field, and don't we believe that he can take care of us? Well, Jesus said to His disciples, look, I didn't call you to the easy life. But I did call you to the good life. I called you to a righteous life. And I called you to alive that to a great extent the world is going to hate. The world is going to hate this life and the world is going to hate you because you're going to be different. And the very fact that you're different, is going to stand in condemnation, to the way that they are living, isn't it something that is not enough? As we lived through several years, where we're the mantra of the world around us in the media, as it was assaulting us in every way was was proclaiming the virtue of tolerance, tolerance, tolerance, just just be tolerant. Now, tolerance is not enough. They will affirmation, affirmation, affirmation, listen. The very fact that you stand, you stand with your feet firmly planted on your convictions of what is right, and what is wrong, that in itself, lights the fire of hatred and animosity of those who are opposed to righteousness. That's the problem. And someone says, Well, I just think we Christians need to be careful how they speak. We do need to be careful how we speak. And we need to speak with wisdom. And we need to let our speech be with Grace Season with salt. And we need to speak in love to one another, I believe all of those things. But folks, I want to tell you

Unknown Speaker  24:00
something. Speaking the right way, is not going to negate this principle that Jesus just set forth.

Unknown Speaker  24:17
He said they're going to hate you not just because of the way you talk. They're going to hate you because you're righteous. And your righteousness stands in condemnation, to their sin.

Unknown Speaker  24:31
It's going to be ugly. At times Jesus said. Let me say something to you about your children live in a world where all of us if we're not worried about our children, worried about our grandchildren?

Unknown Speaker  24:52
Maybe our great grandchildren all what kind of world are they going to have to be raised? Well The world that we were raised in different packaging, different flavors of sin and unrighteousness. But at the end of the day, it's the same menu, and the same problem and the same stench and the same dangers. And I want to say to you, if you think that there's some magic formula, that Christians need to learn some some secret key to the success of raising children, so they can just blend in to this world and they will be loved and accepted. Go back and read again. The Gospel of John.

Unknown Speaker  25:49
Jesus said, I'm telling you, the problem is not that darkness abhors light. That's the problem. Was it I just, I just want my children to, I just want them to fit in, I want them to have this sense of belonging, I want to say this to you.

Unknown Speaker  26:18
One of the most dangerous things you can teach your children is to value this sense of belonging to this world. We don't belong to this world. And children do well to learn from a very early age, that we're different. I laugh a lot, we like to go down to down around Etheridge, Tennessee and buy fruits and vegetables and things.

Unknown Speaker  26:52
There are a group of people, they're called the Amish. And they do things a little different in their families. And I remind my kids all the time, my grandkids.

Unknown Speaker  27:10
I said, you need to look at the folks and you need to learn something. You can live true to your convictions. And there's a very real sense in which we are coming into a generation in which God's people are going to be the Amish of our culture. Those who are righteous are going to be odd and different from all the rest. Jesus is saying I'm calling you to be different and be different and being different is not easy. Secondly, in this counter cultural reality, you need to know that accommodation is simply not allowed. There can be no compromise with the spirit of this age, there is no bending of the rules of righteousness, and there is no apology for the message of Jesus Christ. None. Never, ever. We do not apologize for being Christians. We do not apologize for bearing the name of Jesus, we do not apologize for standing on our convictions that we will do what is right before God. On the day of Pentecost, when there are 1000s of Jews who were gathered for that feast day, and Peter has the opportunity to stand up and invite them for the very first time into the kingdom of God. What an opportunity to, you know, let's just let bygones be bygones. And I mean, after all, everybody believes in God, let's just hold hands and be sweet and get along with everybody. I'll tell you what he said. He said, this Jesus of Nazareth, God showed him to you by the signs and the wonders and the miracles that he performed in your image. You killed him. And God raised Him from the dead, seated Him at His right hand exalted him to be both Lord and Christ. Let me tell you, Peter was not accommodating anybody that day. When Jesus was telling his apostles that he was going to leave and he was going to send to them the comfort of the Holy Spirit. He said, And when he comes the very first thing Jesus said, the first thing he's going to do is convict the world. Someone said of righteousness. No to convict the world of sin I'll tell you it is a wonderful, wonderful privilege to be able to carry the message of salvation to the loss and to talk to someone about our Savior, Jesus Christ. But I want to tell you, we need to understand something. The only person who will ever truly love the Savior is the person who understands that he's lost and he needs to be saved. As a matter of fact, when the Apostle Paul and Romans, chapters one, two, and three, as he's developing his first major sub thesis of that letter, he is is thesis is the gospel. I'm not ashamed of it. It's the power of God unto salvation all. Well, who needs the gospel? Glad you asked. Paul said, three, get this point number one, the Gentiles need the gospel, the wrath of God shall be revealed from heaven against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men. And then Paul is going to go on and talk about this God, who has declared himself and he showed himself to this world, His power and His divinity, even through the themes that he has made, so that they may be without excuse. Those who do not acknowledge him.

Unknown Speaker  31:59
And the Jews as they are listening to Paul, wax eloquent in his passion, for the judgment of God that is coming to the Gentiles for not knowing God, they are Don't you know, sitting in the amen corner saying, preach on brother? Let them have it. But Paul's not done. Because in chapter two, he said, and by the way, the Gentiles aren't the only ones who need the gospel, that is the power of God to salvation. The Jews, we needed also, when we who received the law, we didn't keep the law, that the Gentiles who are going to be judged apart from the law, we're going to be condemned under the law. Who needs to be saved? Paul said, I'll tell you something. There is none righteous, no, not want all have sinned, and fallen short of the glory of God. I'll tell you who needs the gospel. Paul said everybody does. Accommodation is not allowed. Let me do some when Stephen was standing up before the Sanhedrin if there ever was a man who understood that he was standing in the presence of a hostile audience of Stephen got it.

Unknown Speaker  33:35
It hadn't been that many days. Prior to that day that these were the very rulers who were shouting, crucify him. Crucify Him. If there was ever a time when, when Stephen would have had the opportunity to, I'm not going to say, you know, to preach a lie, but just to tone it down a bit.

Unknown Speaker  34:11
This would have been the day but as Stephen reached the climactic point of his sermon that day, there was no accommodation. There was no watering down the message. There was no avoiding the issue.

Unknown Speaker  34:39
And on that day, it cost him his life. Over and over again in the New Testament Peter when he stood before the Jerusalem Council, the apostle Paul before Festus in a grip, there are plenty of opportunities. There plenty of opportunities to accommodate the story for the cultural setting. Now just want to say to your folks, that's not the way the gospel was spread in the first century. The third thing that we ought to see from what Jesus said to His disciples, and what we see in the Gospel of John, even in the life of Jesus, and then in the life of lives of His apostles, is that when we clothe ourselves in the character of Jesus Christ, conflict is going to be inevitable. The Spirit of God has revealed a word from God, a gospel message that clashes, it is a message that clashes with both the cultural Church and the secular world. I want to remind you that the most vicious opposition to the kingdom preaching that Jesus did in his apostles that did not come from the Romans. It came from those scripture quoting Passover eating temple attending Jews. So it came from.

Unknown Speaker  36:13
And I'll tell you something. God's people today, we're going to have to find our voice, first of all, among our own brethren, and we're going to have to find our resolve and our conviction and our willingness

Unknown Speaker  36:47
to stand for what is right, and what is true. And here, here is this club of orthodoxy here, they have for 1500 years been practicing circumcision. And I can tell you right now, no one is going to be part of this holy group if they are not circumcised, and the Apostle Paul said let him be accursed. That is not the gospel. There may well come a day when, among our own brethren, we're going to find out that standing up for truth and what is right is going to create conflict, first of all in the household of God. I'm saying to you, folks, let's stand with Jesus. Let's speak the truth. And the chips will fall where they fall. And, and folks will show themselves to be who they are, that and those with honest and good hearts, they will migrate toward the truth.

Unknown Speaker  38:13
And the others. They will migrate toward whatever is motivating them. Over and over again. We saw the conflicts in the book of acts as the gospel was preached.

Unknown Speaker  38:32
Because you just can't be a Christian honoring Christ as Lord and dropped by the temple for a little Dianna worship on the way home.

Unknown Speaker  38:45
You just can't do that. So is it? Now, let me tell you something. Our entire 401 K is invested in that temple up there.

Unknown Speaker  38:59
I mean, don't forget your granddaddy helped lay the stones up there we we have three generations of gold and silver. And I'm telling you there's a price. There's a price to be paid there. There are conflicts that are coming and we start messing with people's financial gain and you start creating discomfort in our very comfortable lives. Then we're going to find out what what is really motivating us more than anything else, Jesus said, I want to ask you something. Do you think that I came to bring peace to this world? came not to bring peace but a sword I came to set a man at variance against his father and a daughter against her mother and daughter law against her mother, a lot of man's enemies are going to be those of his own household. And Jesus is saying, look, he that loves father, mother, son or daughter more than Me is not worthy of me. You're not ready for the Kingdom. Because in the kingdom, I come first.

Unknown Speaker  40:26
And Jesus said, I want to tell you, no one, no one ever gave up anything. But what he's not going to receive it back to himself a hundredfold.

Unknown Speaker  40:36
The apostle Paul would say it this way, I reckon that the sufferings of this present world are not worthy to be compared to the glory that shall be revealed to us.

Unknown Speaker  40:53
That that is a tremendous thought. The sufferings of this present, were I just got back from being overseas, again. I do quite a bit of work over in Italy.

Unknown Speaker  41:12
And going back and forth across the pond, the last few times I've gone. There's this annoying thing that they made us where from the time we got into the airport, the whole time we're in the airport, we boarded the flight hours and hours and hours on the flight would that thing smothering me the whole way? Oh, do you hear the violins playing? How much I suffered?

Unknown Speaker  41:45
Are you kidding? Me people later asked me about that I want to say so I'm ashamed. I'm ashamed to say anything about the creature comforts or lack there of that I may have had in travel. But the Apostle Paul would would write about his he traveled to

Unknown Speaker  42:14
he went across the water on a boat into the water, I'm scared to death of being on a boat in the water. I don't mind flying over it. I've never been on a cruise. It's not on my bucket list either. But I'll tell you, one of the reasons why is because I don't want to be in the water. Paul said he was in the water at night and the day that the first time something touched my toe or my foot, that's it. I would either walk on water or the Lord just take me home right then because it would be I'd be done.

Unknown Speaker  42:56
I would be done. creature comforts. Now, we don't know much about suffering for the Lord. I'll tell you what, I tell you what Jesus said. He said, If you live the way I'm calling you to live,

Unknown Speaker  43:19
there's going to be a price to pay and over and over again. in New Testament times, there were moments when the Christians paid the price. And the words of the Apostle Paul, over and over again had come to our minds whenever we are, are convinced that we are suffering for righteousness sake. And it's just not right. It's just not fair.

Unknown Speaker  43:54
That's, that may be true. But the sufferings of this present world are not worthy to be compared to the glory that's going to be revealed to

Unknown Speaker  44:09
us. And then this this countercultural living, it will ultimately expose the happiness lie there are people who believe that God's ultimate aim and sending Jesus to this world was to make me happy. And I would just want to tell you that was not God's ultimate objective in sending Christ to Calvary was not to make me happy. It was to make me righteous. And God knew that in my righteousness. I would gain happiness as a blessing and reward. God wants us to be righteous, and over and over again. He calls us to that righteousness. I'll tell you what happens when Christians live in a counter cultural way. That's you and me. And it's in this world that we're living in now. And folks, we're becoming more and more obvious. In our neighborhoods and in our schools and in our workplaces, in our offices, and the and the, in the communities where we live, it's it's easier and easier to spot us. How many people how many people in your neighborhood were leaving home tonight around 630? Every all the kids and the parents getting in the car, if the kids and the parents were there together and getting in the car carrying their Bibles headed to Bible study tonight. Did you see your neighborhood just turning out tonight? Going to Bible study on Wednesday night, on Sunday morning. Do you see all the folks in your neighborhood just creating a traffic jam at the entrance to the subdivision all of them trying to get out to get to church on Sunday morning. I'm telling you more and more and more. We're becoming obvious in the world in which we live. When Paul went to Thessalonica, and he preached the gospel there, there was a riot that ensued and the accusation were these are the people who have turned the world upside down. May God help us to be the people who will be accused of turning the world upside down. I would, that our lives and our influence could so influence people around us that the city authorities would be disturbed. What a wonderful thing. Being different is not easy, and accommodation is not allowed. And conflict is inevitable and the happiness lies exposed. But in the first century, the word that was revealed by the Holy Spirit, powerfully disturbed both the religious establishment and the secular world. And I'm telling you in the 21st century, it still does. Jesus said, I've given them your word. And the world has hated them, because they are not of this world.

Unknown Speaker  47:18
counter cultural people do not ask you to take them out of the world,

Unknown Speaker  47:27
but that you keep them from the evil one. They are not all of the world. Just as I am not of the world. And I leave you with these words of the Lord. I've said these things to you. Jesus said to his apostles, I've said these things to you that in me you may have peace in the world. You will have tribulation, but take heart. I have overcome the world. And that great. I'm telling you, I don't know chapter by chapter. All this is going to be written in the book, but I'll tell you this, I know how it ends. I know how it ends and the lamb is victorious. And all of his people are gathered home. That's what it's all about. We're part of that narrative. If you're here tonight, not a Christian, what a wonderful time for you. To make your public confession of faith in Jesus Christ as the Son of God, be united with Him in baptism. have your sins washed away be born in New into the family of God and spend your life living for Him if you're a child of God, and you need to come home to the Lord. Why don't you come well we stand and sing we invite you
