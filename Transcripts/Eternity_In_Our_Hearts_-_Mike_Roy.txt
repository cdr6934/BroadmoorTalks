It is always a privilege and an honor to come together to assemble with the with each of you to worship and praise our God in heaven. That's what He created us for. As Chris mentioned in Lord suffered, we live for Him, we reciprocate God's love for us by serving Him by being obedient to Him and applying his word to our lives. So it's great to be with you this morning, and appreciate the songs that Evan LED. For me that to complement this lesson, as we will be looking at Ecclesiastes chapter 11. This morning, say secular verses over there, especially the first eight verses, or I think the first 11 verses of the koozie STS. Chapter Three contains some of the most well known verses in the Bible. In fact, the musical group, the birds, made a song back in the 60s called Turn, turn, turn to everything, there's a season time for repurposing the heaven, well known song, well known section of Scripture, but a few verses down from there. And I believe verse 11, if I'm not mistaken, is one of the most compelling and intriguing statements in Scripture that tells us a God placed eternity in the heart of man. And so this morning, I want you to think with me about this phrase about this truth and what it means. And we can probably think about that and and talk about it for a long time and still not have a full understanding of everything that God implies from that, but with the writer of Ecclesiastes tells us, what Solomon tells us here in chapter three, is that God placed eternity in the heart of every human being. And I think when you contemplate that we naturally ask the questions, What does God want me to learn from this truth? What truth is God trying to convey to me from this phrase, I think one of the most helpful mindsets that we need to develop and maintain is an eternal perspective, in our daily lives, we have to live our lives in view, or through the lens of eternity. And that helps us to make the right decisions that helps us to obey the gospel of Jesus Christ, that helps us to serve him faithfully. And so there's this phrase in Ecclesiastes chapter three, that I'm really focusing on this morning, where God placed eternity in the human heart. What does that mean? We'll talk about that this morning. So in this lesson, the first section we're going to kind of focus on this text and Ecclesia ClickZ STS chapter three, then I've got four points I want to make, maybe to support that or in conjunction with that. But look at this text I've got on the screen, and Ecclesiastes chapter three. And verses nine through 11. This is the New Living Translation. This is what the people really get for all their hard work. I have seen the burden God has placed on us all, yet God has made everything beautiful for its own time, he has planted eternity in the human heart. But even so people cannot see the whole scope of God's work from beginning to end. So one of the truths there that Solomon has conveyed to us, a God planted eternity, and the human heart. So the Amplified Bible to maybe give us some appreciation of that says that, in verse 11, that he made everything beautiful and appropriate in his time, he has also planted eternity that has a sense of divine purpose in the human heart, a mysterious longing which nothing under the sun can satisfy except God. So again, that gives us helps us to maybe begin to think about what does it mean when God planted eternity, in your heart, in the hearts of all people. And so, again, just looking at verse 11, forget this slide to advance.

Mike Roy  04:18
What we're focusing on here, this is the NIV, but in verse 11, that God has set eternity in the human heart. And so again, the question we're asking is, What Does god mean by this? What does he want us to learn from this? And I suggest as we think about this particular phrase, it can really have a major and positive impact in our lives when I understand that God put eternity in the heart of every single person who has ever lived, or whoever will live. God's trying to get our attention. He wants us to come to love Him and serve Him and obey Him. So let's think about this phrase for a few minutes. And then we'll look at some supporting scriptures. And, again, four points that I want to use along side this text over here. I like the comment from Albert Barnes noted, Commentator From long time ago. This is what he said about this phrase. He said God has placed in the inborn constitution of man, the capability of conceiving of eternity, the struggle to apprehend the everlasting and the longing for an eternal law. That's a lot to take in right there. So I think he's, he's right on when he says this, that God has placed within the inborn constitution of human beings, the capability of conceiving of eternity. And then the struggle to reach that to apprehend everlasting life, and then the longing for an eternal so I thought his his comments were very helpful. And so what I think it's reminded to us when we say that God has placed eternity in our hearts, that God wants us to be thinking about eternity, he wants us to long for eternity, He created us in such a way that we would spend eternity with Him, praising him and worshiping Him forevermore, if we serve if we obey his will obey the gospel of Jesus Christ. And so it's a reminder that all human beings have this desire to know what life is like after the grave. Driving down Galton road the other day passed a big military cemetery on the one hand side, then the other side is there. The other cemetery, I see just a sea of tombstones, on the right side of all military people die there. That's all that's left to them, right? And we say what is next? Is at it. And these women, mainly people fighting in the Civil War, many of them on the military cemetery. But we asked a question, what happens after the grave, everybody has that longing for something more, something more meaningful, more fulfilling. And I suggest to you that when it says that God placed eternity in the human heart, He stamped us in his course, he made us in His own image and likeness. But it's like a, our DNA has been crafted by God, with an upward look towards him, in the in this eternal hunger that we have is given to us by God. So in Acts chapter 17, says that God placed mankind over all the earth in order that they would seek Him and find Him. So that's part of the DNA, God put us on this earth, to look for him, to search him out, but ultimately, to love Him, to serve Him and to obey Him. That's why you're here today, to search for God to love Him, to serve him to obey Him to praise him, and his New Testament Christians. So what we are doing, but this is God's design. So you put eternity in the human heart, as a way of making us think about really what's most important, and God uses his creative skills in designing skills through all of creation, to a purpose, accomplish different purposes. I was thinking about this the other day, why does salmon swim upstream? That's a tough task to do. They're going back to the place of birth Scientists tell us that this is their safe place. Why are they traveling all these miles fighting the current going upstream to get to this cool, clear water where they spawn, and all these eggs are laid there? And then many of them die.

Mike Roy  08:52
And the process is repeated over and over? Why do they do that? God makes them do that. It's in their DNA as part of his design. You think about the migration pattern of whales that they go on, they move all over the globe, going back to maybe a place of birth for them or to find a place to give birth to their calves. In fact, one statistic I read said that the humpback whales would migrate over 5000 miles from Costa Rica, down to Antarctica in the South. Why would the whales travel 5000 miles to do this? Is because God put that in the whales. And you see all types of real migration patterns here the western coast of our country from Alaska and the north down to Mexico and the South. Why are they doing this? Is because God put it so to speak in their hearts, so they can reproduce and have more offspring and, and so again, it's just reminder that God has made us in such a way that he wants us to be thinking about him. And one of the questions is we are focused on this phrase, eternity in the human heart. Why is the universe so big? Why is the world that we live in so vast? There's probably lots of questions. Here's one image I found is probably some better ones of our solar system. It's it staggers the mind, to grasp how big our solar system is our galaxy. In fact, I believe, One source said it would take 200,000 years per spacecraft, traveling at the speed of light, to make it from one end of our galaxy to the other end, the Milky Way galaxy 200,000 years traveling at the speed of light, that's 186,000 miles per second. That's just our galaxy. Not to mention the whole universe, which has billions of galaxies. Why is world so big? Why is it so vast? I'll tell you why I think it is. Because it gives us a glimpse of the concept of eternity, knowing God and doing His will, that's the most important issue for each one of us. And so God wants us to be thinking about him, and to realize that he is bigger than this world, and He wants us to look at him and to think about his power. And ultimately, he wants us to come to know Him, to love him to serve Him. And so the pictures of somebody looking at on a star Starry Night, again, just were mesmerized by the power of God's creation, and the vastness of His creation. So let's go ahead and shift to the second part of this lesson. And there's four points I want us to think about, in connection with our focus on this first, a God placed eternity in the human heart. The first point I want to make is, excuse me, is to say that God made us like himself as eternal spirits. So God has an underlying motive for creating you and creating me, He wants us ultimately, he wants all people ultimately, to come to know His will to repent of sin, to obey the gospel of Christ so that we can spend eternity as we've been thinking about this morning, worshiping and praising God in His heavenly realm. So here in Genesis chapter one verses 26. And 27, says, Then God said, Let us make man in Our image, after Our likeness, and let them have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the birds of the heavens, and over the livestock and over all the earth, and over every creeping thing that creeps on the earth. So God created man in His own image, in the image of God, He created him, male and female, He created him this is a well known verse of scripture, obviously, and to be made of the image or the likeness of God means obviously, that we can think we can reason we can argue, we can love we can hate, we can love righteousness, we can hate evil, we can make do we can we can have dominion, we can rule over creation.

Mike Roy  13:26
But when we think about the image of God, does he look like me? Does he look like Kevin, or Evan or somebody? No, God is not a physical being. God isn't a god is an eternal spirit. So it to be made in the image. And the likeness of God is to be made as an eternal spirit. What we see here in my flesh, in my bones, as the outside stuff, my soul is inside of me, and your spirit is inside of you. And so to be made in, in God, in God's image to be made like himself means that we are eternal spirits. When the Psalm was talks about God's greatness, and his power, says, Lord, you have been our dwelling place and this is Psalm chapter 19, verse one and two, you have been our dwelling place in all generations Before the mountains were brought forth, who brought forth the mountains God did, or ever you had formed the earth and the world, from everlasting, to everlasting, You are God, that defines who God is. He is eternal. He is from ever lasting. And he goes on to ever lasting, I can't fathom that. It's hard to understand how vast and how, how enormously powerful and holy and great God is. With the Psalms shows again that you that God is an eternal spirit. And he made us to be like himself. And so it's a reminder that our mortal bodies house our souls and before too long, our bodies will go to the earth, they will die. And then, depending on the choices, we making this life, we will either live with God forever in heaven, or away from him in hell, based on the choices that you make, and I make today, that's what this life is all about. So when you look at Ecclesiastes, chapter 12, I relate more to chapter 12. Now that I'm getting a little bit older, the mind becomes a bit fuzzy. And the physical skills kind of diminished in some ways. It talks about, we're being so afraid of heights and the mourners go about in the streets, man goes to eternal home. But verse six says, Remember, you're creative before the silver cord is loose, or the Golden Bowl is broken, or the picture shattered at the fountain, or the wheel broken at the well, then the dust will return to the earth as it was. And the Spirit will return to God who gave it for people who don't think we have a soul, they don't understand scripture in truth. So what we see on the outside, that's our fleshly bodies, that's just the temporary attend, that our soul occupies. When my life is over, when your life is over, our bodies go back to the dust.

Mike Roy  16:32
But our spirit goes back to God who gave it. And so it's reminded that, like God, we have eternal spirits in where we spend eternity is going to be based upon our decisions in this life, whether we love God, serve him obey his will. Or if we decide that we're going to go our own way, and not be like the salmon going upstream, we're just going to go the easy route. And then we miss out on fellowship with God for all eternity. So God made us like himself as eternal spirits. Secondly, I want to suggest to us that God designed us and created us to worship Him eternally. Before this world was ever made, he had a vision of a people who would love Him, serve Him and worship Him in His heavenly home for all of eternity. And so again, it's a reminder of what it means when it says that God placed eternity in the human heart. So you look at excuse me, Revelation, chapter four, and chapter five, these are worship scenes. So John is trying to receive some encouragement, and send it on to the churches of Asia Minor, to have them persevere in the faith and not to give up. So he's given a worship scene, and this was the ads gonna be like, and what's going on, for in John's life, now is is on the island of Patmos. He's in banishment, his persecution, there's depth is suffering, this all that kind of stuff. But the image in the vision that he gets from God is is of that of a worship seen in heaven. And verse nine says, Whenever the living creatures give glory and honor, and thanks to him, who is seated on the throne, who lives forever and ever, the 24 elders fall down before Him, who was seated on the throne in worship Him who lives forever and ever, they cast their crowns before the throne, saying, Worthy are you our Lord in God, to receive glory, and honor and power for you created all things, and by your will, they existed and were created. So this is a picture of God's eternal plans for for his people, is we can be in God's presence and worship Him for all eternity. And that's what helps us get through the challenges of this life. And there's difficulties that we're facing in the world around us. So God, understanding again, connecting ourselves to that phrase, eternity in the human heart, that God designed us for eternal worship. Think about that. It's not going to be comparable to a worship setting. We have wonderful worship here at Broadmoor. But nothing is perfect in his life, but but God designed us for everlasting worship. That's what life's about. It's not about how much money you make, or how much money you lose, what kind of job you have, what kind of job you don't have, or how fit and healthy you are, or how unhealthy you are. And when we do God's will, we can spend eternity praising him and giving him the honor that that is do him in Revelation chapter five, same scene or similar scene. And this vision shown to Johnny's died look in this vision. I've heard around the throne and the living creatures and the elders of the voice and the elders, the voice of many angels, numbering myriads of myriads and things 1000s of 1000s Sing to the Lord voice worthy as a lamb, to receive power and wealth and wisdom in might in honor and glory and blessing. And I heard every creature in heaven, and on earth and under the earth and indicee, and all that is in them, saying, To him who sits on the throne, and to the Lamb, be blessing and honor and glory and might for forever and ever were eternal beings. We've been stamped in the image of likeness of God designed and created to worship Him, and praise Him for all eternity. So this life is just a little speck on that radar. You're here for just a few days, and then you're gone. And so the most important issue is, am I going to do God's will? Am I going to learn God's will? Am I going to obey the gospel of Jesus Christ. So secondly, God designed us to worship Him eternally. Thirdly,

Mike Roy  20:59
maybe a similar point by made this a separate point that God designed us for eternal pleasure, we all like pleasure. And we want to make sure that we experience pleasure on God's terms, and not in the selfish or sinful way. And Psalm chapter 16. This is a Psalm of David. But when Peter gives his sermon and accepted to he's applying this to Jesus, that God was not going to abandon his soul to shield in the realm of the dead. And or let his, let him see decay, he said, You will make known to me the path of life, you will fill me with joy in your presence, with eternal pleasures, it's your right hand. So Psalm chapter 16, verse 11, is a verse that you ought to be in your memory that God created us to experience eternal pleasures at his right hand. So again, it's a reminder that God created us for His pleasure, and he wants us to enjoy his presence for all eternity. And that's why he, he put eternity in our hearts. That's why he made us in His image and likeness, so that we can make plans to be with him. When this life is all within this life is over the fourth point that I want to make, excuse me. From a practical standpoint, then this Our challenge is to think about in visualize eternity, every day, I know that's, maybe it's hard to do, maybe we get So, so busy, sometimes we we push the thought of eternity out of our minds. But since God placed eternity and the human heart, He made us in His image and likeness. I don't need to be thinking about the house that I live in, and you know, getting some more land and all those things, business decisions, we all make those types of things. But the focus of our heart has to be on eternity, not on how much money you have in the bank, or how your investments are doing, or not doing, or what your travel plan, we all have those things. But but every day, stop and think about eternity. God put eternity in my heart, so that I will be thinking about him every day in my life. So that is our challenge, to think about individualize eternity every day. That means practically, we need to visualize heaven, we need to visualize hell. We need to visualize the Day of Judgment. Those are the three things that Harold comer, my mentor and longtime friend, when I was preaching in North Alabama, taught me to visualize Heaven and Hell in a Day of Judgment every single day, because that helps us to know what's most important in this life, and getting my family to have his number one, that's what and then in preaching the same thing, I want to get as many people as I can to be in God's presence. And so our challenge is to think about eternity every day. Look at Paul says over here in second Corinthians chapter four in the midst of all his suffering, persecution, the beatings and everything else. Paul said, therefore, we do not lose heart, but though our other our outer person is decaying. And the older I get an amen that that's happening, isn't it? The outer person is decaying. Our bodies are wearing down as we get older, our minds are becoming a little bit fuzzier, or more fuzzy, or however you want to say that why that's happening, policy but the other person is decaying. Yet our inner person is being renewed day by day. For our momentary light affliction is producing for us an eternal weight of glory, beyond all comparison, and Paul says While we look not at the things we're seeing, Paul said, I do not look at the things that are seen. I don't look To the earth, I don't look just at the things around here creation. He may do that to be reminded of God's power, but he's not looking at the present world for satisfaction. But he says at the things which are not seen God in heaven, eternity Jesus on this throne, he said, That's what I look at, except for the things we're just seeing are temporal. This pulpit, we're getting a new renovation here, Broadmoor nice, great for worship and teaching as one. But sooner or later, this is all going away. The things that are seen are temporal. But the things which are not seen are eternal. So that means we have to be thinking about eternity.

Mike Roy  25:45
Every day. That's what's most important. And we get so distracted, it's so easy for us to push the thought of eternity out of our hearts and minds. One of the things I've done through the years on occasion with SERMs is to put together but I'm calling verbal affirmations. I'm all about self talk or talking to yourself. I've been doing it my whole life. And it's good to be positive in your talking. But what I'm suggesting is we want to make applications and we prayed this morning to understand the word of God, what does it mean to have eternity in our hearts? I think we need to take God's word and speak it out loud. I've tried to do that. I don't do that as consistently as I should. But I'm saying you take these truths of scripture and you verbally express them out loud to yourself or to your family, in your house, in your bedroom, in your office, in your truck, wherever you are, and say things like this. God placed eternity in my heart. And I'm keeping it there. What happens? We get it gets pushed out, I'm not thinking about eternity, I'm going to get a raise, get a new job, new promotion, whatever it might be. All those things crowd this out. But so this verbal affirmation, I'm saying you say this, throughout the day, God placed eternity in my heart. And I'm not going to lose it. I'm going to keep it there. Or something like this. I choose eternity with God, over brief, earthly pleasure. What God offers us in in heaven? Is he ever lasting pleasure. There's nothing there's no pleasure in this life that compares with what God wants to give you in me. So we say say this out loud. I choose eternity with God over brief, earthly pleasure. And then here's another suggestion I have been created and designed for eternal fellowship with God. So what happens? When what happens when you say that out loud? repeatedly? Do you do this every day you do this? Do you like a 21 day plan? Like hell would you say when you save it every day, and you visualize it gets what happens? I'm going to heaven. I don't care what happens to the stock market, or who's in the White House or who's on the throne of England, I'm on my way to heaven. And when you verbalize the things you begin to believe them more and more. So tell yourself, I have been created and designed for eternal worship. I'm not going to miss out on that. And my family is not going to miss out on that view my level best to make sure that happens. And so again, here's another thought, verbal affirmation, I'm keeping eternity in my heart every day. So again, the through the years I've done this occasionally, I think it's helpful as a practical way of applying God's Word, to realize what we want to take from the lessons that we hear whether it's mine or anyone else's, is you take these truths and you save them out loud, just like Louise, sing songs going down the road, these songs of worship in Christ alone, the more you sing that and let those words resonate in your heart, it transforms you and it transforms me. And so as a practical thing that I can leave with you just we'll go ahead and wrap up the lesson. Appreciate your attention this morning. Hope that the lesson is is helpful for you. But the question that I leave for each one of us is this question is eternity in your heart, or have you pushed it out? You're not really thinking about eternity get to my other plans and goals and aspirations and dreams? is eternity in your heart. Are you thinking about gold or dirt? Are you thinking about walking on streets of gold one day, or you think about walking on your dirt driveway? It's gonna go it's gonna be gone. So God placed eternity in our hearts, we have to be careful not to not to push the fall of eternity out of our hearts and minds. And so as we wrap up the lesson, are you ready for eternity? I trust that we are but if you here this morning you haven't obeyed the Gospel Jesus Christ. You have to do that. That's how you get prepared for eternity. Believe that Jesus is the Messiah. Repent of your sins, confess your faith in Him and be BAPTIZED IN WATER immersed like in this, this tub of water behind me. be immersed in water. That's how you get your sins forgiven. If you haven't done that, we urge you to do that. Or maybe for all of us, maybe just need to renew your faith in renew your focus on eternity if there's any way that we can encourage you this morning you might come always stand and sing this invitation song
