Good evening. Thank you for having me to be a part of this summer's series. Tonight we are in John chapter 13. If you'll turn in your Bibles with me there will spend a great balance of our time considering this text. Our Lord Jesus had a way of sometimes bringing special occasions to an awkward end, cutting straight to the undercurrent of interactions with people. Now, I don't intend to drop in here, invited guests that I am to your Wednesday night assemblies and make things you know, unnecessarily awkward. So don't go too far with that lead in. But I am here to say that there is something to be gained in giving some careful thought to when Jesus went and did that kind of thing. When we can look at stories where he's looking at people in their faces and their situations, and he's looking through them, and right off the page and into our lives. The way he could just cut through surface level niceties of formal occasions when he needed to. So while I don't mean to make it weird, I do think and I commend to You all, to take opportunities to listen to the very challenging and cutting words of your Lord when things need to be made weird in your relationship with him. From time to time, Jesus had a way of doing this, whenever there was something important that was lurking under the surface is more of a subtext, especially in the intentions of the people around him. Jesus was not content with shallow positivity, he always cut to the heart of matters, to look straight into the hearts of people and to call out their issues. The fact is the final barrier to giving our all to our Lord, which is really what we have to do if we're going to pass through the gates of the Beatitudes and through the qualities of the sermon on the mount to be Kingdom citizens. We have to let go of the things that we're holding on to within ourselves, the Lord knows that we won't have real peace with him until we get to the messy, necessary work of clearing up that final thicket, in our conflicted spirits, whatever it is, he wants illustrated this and that's what we're looking at tonight by a very awkward interruption. During a holiday feast. We'll begin reading at the beginning of the chapter. Now before the feast of the Passover, Jesus knowing that His hour had come, that he would depart out of this world to the Father, Having loved His own who were in the world. He loved them to the end. During supper, the devil having already put into the heart of Judas Iscariot, the son of Simon to betray Him, Jesus knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands, and that he had come forth from God, and was going back to God got up from supper, and laid aside His garments, and taking a towel he girded himself. Then he poured water into the basin and began to wash the disciples feet and to wipe them with the towel with which he was girded. This was a lowly, but necessary work that Jesus was doing. Not completely alien to these men and what they were they're doing. In this time and place people walked wherever they were going. And they did it wearing sandals and walking on dusty roads. So if people were eating at a household that had slaves, it was the task of the lowliest of the slaves to wash the guests feet. But it was as they came in from the outside to eat. Some sources say that if you had Jewish and Gentile slaves, you made the Gentile slaves do this particular job. It wasn't just that sandal feet are fandel feet, right? They're dirty. They're smelly. It was also a status thing. Think about it this way. Once someone has scrubbed between your toes, it is hard to look them in the eye.

Mitch Stevens  04:38
The text says Jesus verse four rows from supper. That's why I pointed out this is something you do as you're coming in from outside. This should have been taken care of. But before the start of the meal, they're eating alone, of course, so there's no waitstaff so I would suppose that each man would have been expected to have seen to this himself. But that obviously hadn't happened. Perhaps nobody wanted to admit the obvious. So they're all just, you know, holding their noses and getting on with Passover. It's not like they had a table, like we would tuck their feet under once the sandals were off when the Bible says they reclined at a table, that's just what they did. At a meal. In those days, people did not sit on chairs, they reclined on couches, and a couch would hold about three persons. And each would basically lean on his left elbow, with his body out to this side, his head toward the table, and feet away from it. But if you have three guys that are all laid out like this, then you also have a picture here of how the beloved disciple, presumably John, is at the Lord's breast. It's not like it's two grown men cuddling, like you might picture it's a man at his trusted head, who if he leaned back is that the Lord's breast trusted a close position. But uh, you were eating in proximity to your neighbors feet. One summer years ago, I came home after a long day. And I sat down on the carpet by the coffee table in the living room where all the family was already gathered. And I took off my shoes. And that always just feels so good, doesn't it? Especially after a long, hard day. But suddenly, my oldest son Ben, jumped back, put his shirt over his nose and said, Dad, your feet steak. This is the one with a sensitive nose. He's always been that way. But you know, something he's right. And I knew it. As soon as I took off my shoes, I can tell that I figured that it would become tolerable as soon as they cooled down. And my long suffering wife is there this whole time. And she chose to let it go without comment, but then was having none of it. So I did what any good father would do. I wrestled him to the ground and put my feet in his face. But you know what, then, I quietly left the room, like I was going to the bathroom. But what I did was I took off my socks, and I washed my feet. Because I was embarrassed. And by the way, I don't have like a condition. They were old shoes. My feet are much better today since I've had COVID. In fact, they don't really smell at all. Well, so Peter in this story is in a similar sort of confrontation. But he's the one. The one drawing up next to him, to put his feet in his hands, is the Lord Jesus Christ. The one that Peter had so effectively confessed, is the Son of the living God. So Peter recoils as we continue our story in verse six. So he came to Simon Peter, he said to him, Lord, do you wash my feet? Jesus answered and said to him, what I do, you do not realize now but you will understand hereafter. Peter said to him, never shall you wash my feet. Jesus answered him, if I do not wash you, you have no part with Me. Simon Peter said to Him, Lord, then wash not only my feet, but also my hands in my head.

Mitch Stevens  08:41
So Jesus is doing this, as a parable of what he is about to do, in taking our sins upon himself on the cross, First John chapter one, verse seven, says, But if we walk in the light as He is in the light, we have fellowship with one another, and the blood of Jesus, His Son cleanses us from all sin. He's about to cleanse all of mankind, including these his closest disciples, but Peter cannot bear to see the Lord doing something that's only parabolic to something that he's going to do in a much, much greater sense. But it doesn't at all seem to reinforce his role as a leader. And he does not want Jesus Near his feet. Jesus is not instituting a Christian ritual here, like, say, the Lord's Supper. He's illustrating a principle that we must follow. It's more like a sign act, then then a church right. But some people have ritualized this this practice from John 13. Some people have footwashing services. In fact, it's common as especially among charismatics, among Pentecostals. And I have heard of some people who have grown up around footwashing services talk about how they can go off into being these vain empty shows. But I've also heard people who have been in a foot washing service, answer this question. Which is easier to wash someone else's feet? or to have your feet washed by someone else? Put yourself well put yourself in their shoes or out of them. How would you answer? Now the people that I was listening to said that it was by far having their feet washed, is the harder thing to do in those services rather than watching someone else's. That brings out an important truth about our sanctification that I want us to think about as we're in this text tonight, Peter tries to deflect this thing, doesn't he? Once Jesus clarifies, and he says, this is really important. This has to do with your fellowship with me moving forward. Well, then Peter gets on board. But do you see that even when Peter jumps back in the rebound, he's still setting terms. He's like, Oh, I want to pardon you, Lord. But here, let's do the head and the hands to see, look, these parts are more honorable. You see, those are the traditional parts for like a purification ceremony, those things would get involved if a Jew was going in to be ritually cleaned to be acceptable in company, especially Pharisees. When we look at Peter, and I know we tend to get really tough on Peter, but don't we do that same thing? Don't we have some of the same automatically inclination? Do we love the idea of redemption and sanctification and nearness. But we have dark corners, and dirty crevices where we would rather the Lord just not look? You know, give me your heart is is a good song of invitation. It's it's imagery is correct. It's comforting. I like to sing that song. Give me your heart. We want to hold hands with the Lord we want to be also as we sing safe in the arms of Jesus. We want to break bread with the Lord at his table. But what about when he says to all that? Good, good, good. Now let me see your feet. Do we do like Peter? Do we recoil? Oh, no, no, no, no, no, Lord, I could never you would? Well, he would what? Not like what he sees. That's probably true. No longer consider you worthy. No longer desire to save you as his own. We can easily take an uncomfortable truth that we harbor and begin formulating a lie. And this is a lie that can cost us our souls. The lie is this because of what I think, or because of what I've done. I'm not worth saving.

Mitch Stevens  13:28
We humans have a long standing habit of trying to hide from God. stuff he very well already knows. The very night of the footwashing. In just a few moments, text wise, Judas is going to look Jesus in the eye, and he's going to say is that I rabbi? Jonah is another classic example. He tried to run from a direct command of God as if there's a boundary at which he can get beyond a direct command of God, and our greatest grandparents of all ran and hid to conceal their nakedness from God. Let's look back together all the way to Genesis chapter three. Verse seven. Then the eyes of both of them, Adam and Eve were opened, and they knew that they were naked. And they sewed fig leaves together and made themselves loin coverings. They heard the sound of the Lord walking in the garden in the cool of the day. And the man and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God among the trees of the garden. Then the Lord God called to the man and said to him, where are you? He said, I heard the sound of you in the garden and I was afraid, because I was naked. So I hid myself. And he said, Who told you that you were naked? Have you eaten from the tree of which I commanded you not to eat, the man said, The woman whom you gave to be with me, she gave me from the tree, and I ate. Then the Lord God said to the woman, what is this you have done? And the woman said, The serpent deceived me, and I ate. Why do we try? Because we're no different, right? Here's, here's the model for human behavior. Not the planned model. But certainly the track that we follow. Why do we try to hide things from God? Do we think that he doesn't already know when you're reading this story? Do they really think that hide and seek with God behind shrubbery is going to be effective? Do we imagine that he doesn't see we have passages like Hebrews 413 that says nothing in all creation is hidden from God's sight, everything is uncovered and laid bare before the eyes of Him to whom we must give account. I mean, this truth, we sorted out early, don't we? This is first principles, stuff that's covered in the baby class, and the father up above who's looking down in love. So we're all we're careful. From the time we can do the hand motions. So why do we hide? And for that matter? Why does God ask where we are? What Why does he asked them when you you know, he already knows. Because he's summoning. He's challenging, because our shame in our guilt drives us to break the connection from God's presence. He calls us to reconnect. We need to talk then, about shame. You see, shame is one of those multifaceted words a loaded term a lot like pride, where there's a good use of it, and there's a bad abuse of it. And we touch on the good use of shame. Like when we talk about topics like modesty. But tonight, we're talking about the misuse of Shame, shame, it has been approximately defined as this shame is the feeling of intense psychological pain, deriving from the belief that we are unworthy of acceptance and belonging. intense psychological pain deriving from the belief that we are unworthy of acceptance and belonging, shame comes from a traumatic exposure of sin, or nakedness, folly, weakness, deficiency, inferiority, powerlessness, or unworthiness. Now, as you consider those words and those concepts, you'll see that what shames us is not necessarily sinful. We can be triggered or wired in such a way that something that is not actually breaking us from from the one we want, we feel shame toward

Mitch Stevens  18:21
to actually be wrong. But to suffer shame is to feel that the true self with all of its defects is exposed, naked and vulnerable to the damning judgment and criticism of others. Shame is triggered when we anticipate disapproval, or rejection, from those who matter most to us. What comes from that, then is a disconnection and alienation from relationship, the very opposite of what we are made and wired for. Carl Jung called shame, the swamp land of the soul. Once you the idea there being that once you put your feet in it, it just drags you down. You don't know what to do with it. And so it sucks you in. So having been surveyed this huge concept of shame, and what we mean to think about it tonight, I need to ask what makes you ashamed? Because whatever that is, has a profound effect on the way that you think and feel and act. What is your automatic impulse when you are confronted in your shame when you've made a foolish mistake or you have deeply violated a trust you freeze Are you flee, right? All the color may drain from your face, your heart races. And here's the key thing, perhaps a universal thing. You do not want to look that person in the eye. That is a physical reaction that says everything. Because even Jesus said to the effect, the eyes are the window of the soul right to see eye to eye with someone, when we use that phrase, what does it mean? It's to have fellowship, or a Bible phrase, when you are right in the eyes of God. In the eyes of God, that means what it means you have his sincere approval. When you break your gaze, and when you avert your eyes, you are disconnecting, you are fleeing contact. So what did Adam and Eve do? They hear God coming, they're afraid, and they hide. And then they begin deflecting the shame and the guilt. Adam says, the woman that you gave me and he tries to deflect on to the woman, and and to God, right, the woman you gave me. That's what we do, too. We start casting other things, and other people, between ourselves and God, trying to justify ourselves. Within our exposure, our weakness, Adam took a fault before God, and he turned it into a fight with his wife. That's what shame can do. Satan manipulates our shame. He wants the reigns of it. He convinces us that when God offers cleansing, here's that lie. It's not for us. No, no, no, because our stains those don't wash out. Those are too deep. Those are baked in our sins that are foolishness in the past and the present, and even in the future, are only going to hurt the church and lead to further damage. So when Christ calls out our faults, in the context of the church, we've clutched them to our chests. And we flee to the darkness. Just like Judas Iscariot, is about to do. God in His mercy and His grace worked to cover the original shame of Adam and Eve. He gave them garments that were made of animal hides, you remember that. And the importance of that detail is that blood had to be shed in order to cover the effect of their guilt in order to cover that shame, their nakedness. Jesus wants to do the same thing. He wants to provide cleansing. But he says, not just your head, and not just your hands, you're perfectly willing to show me those, I need your feet. Because he knows that if he doesn't have that he has none of us, none of you.

Mitch Stevens  23:22
If you don't give your foulest parts to his keeping and His cleansing, then you cannot do what he's about to ask of you. It's more than just footwashing going on here in John chapter 13, between Christ and Peter, and now we sit in Peters seat, confronted by Christ, we are also to let Christ in to our hidden faults. He must own them. You must ask him to wash them. And you must trust him when he says that he does. Who is this for? It? Well, I'm what I mean is what position is Peter in? Is this for new converts? Is this for unbelievers? What is Peter at this point to the Lord? What are the rest of them? They're believers. And in fact, within the interaction, this comes up there are people who have been qualified. They've been holy washed before. Let's keep reading and see this verse 10. Back to John 13. Jesus said to him, this is after he said, not not just my feet, but my head in my hands. He who has bathed needs only to wash his feet, but it's completely clean. And you are clean. But not all of you. He doesn't mean not all of Peter he knew one who was betraying Him. For this reason, he said not all of you are clean. So when he had washed their feet and taken his garments and recline to table again, he said to them, Do you know what I have done to you? They've had a few minutes you presume to really take this in. Although I imagine the stunned silence has not been broken. You call me Teacher and Lord, and you are right, for so I am. If I then the Lord and the teacher wash your feet, you also ought to wash one another's feet. For I gave you an example, that you also should do, as I did to us. So there's a commissioning within this, I don't mean to dispel this as a one time sign act of the Lord that we don't need to consider deeply in our relationship with one another. I'm simply saying we need not literalized it. Because we miss his main point, if we do, Truly, truly I say to you, a slave is not greater than his master, nor is one who is sent greater than the one who sent him. If you know these things, you are blessed, if you do them, if we don't give Jesus our feet. So what I mean by that is, if we don't have our sense of safety, and stability in him, then we cannot serve others the way he did. If we don't give our feet, our fear of rejection to Him. If we give it to, you know, to somebody, or to something else out there, shame becomes a trap. It becomes a trap when we allow someone else besides God to take away our security, our identity, and our peace of mind. What makes good disciples, what makes good servant leaders like the Lord, it starts with the person that you're looking at in the mirror. If you're not Okay, with that person, then you're going to have a difficult time. How was Jesus able to do? What he does in this story? How can you look Peter in the eye as Peter, his friend, his admirer is sitting shocked and not a little embarrassed at what he was doing. And yet, if if Peter had continued in his refusal, Jesus made clear that he would just move on to the next person at the table. So you see how Jesus is handling it, he's not going to let somebody else's misguided shock or disdain, keep him from his work. If Jesus were relying on a public opinion poll, you know if that's if that's the way he thought he never would have gone to his cross, Jesus is above and beyond Jesus's decision to wash his disciples feet. The secret is, and the secret to Our servant discipleship is an assurance of a relationship with God. That explains a little bit the introduction to the story that we have, at the beginning of the chapter. What was it that would release Jesus to do something that his own disciples considered bad leadership, something that would risk his being seen as a failure and being rejected.

Mitch Stevens  28:20
He knew who he was in the eyes of God. Look at verse three, again, Jesus, knowing that the Father had given all things into his hands and that he had come from God and was going back to God rose from supper. Why was all this extra information here given at the start of the story, because these details give clues to what equipped Jesus to do what he did to lead others the way he did. You could break it down like this. He knew three things. First, he had a sense of provision. That is the Father had given all things into his hands. Everything I need my father has provided for me. So he knew that second, he had a sense of purpose. That would be I know where I came from. I have a foundation, I have a sense of my roots, and I'm not disconnected from them. And third, he had a sense of peace, because he knew where it would all end up when everything was over. I know where I'm from. I know where I'm going. And I know I am well equipped. There's your three point sermon of assurance. Jesus had a sense of security in his relationship with the father so secure, that he could risk the appearance in his well if he were dependent his most needed witnesses, right. But that's not how he saw it. But he risked the appearance of failure in his leadership and even risk being rejected by these people who are closest to him. So that's why Jesus says, give me your feet. Give me your shame, Christians, he's washed your body. But you've got to keep giving him your dirt. If you want to walk in fellowship with Him, that John addressed this again in his first letter, if we say we have no sin, we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us. And we're at the table. And the kid next to us is going man, Something stinks. If we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness. If we say we have not sinned, we make Him a liar, and His word is not in us. Do you see that that cuts as starkly as Jesus with Peter, if we don't go beyond this? You're not part of this. You've got to do that. So you don't fear the disapproval of men more than the disapproval of God. You see, Satan is a blackmailer. Now, if you think about it in terms of blackmail, what is the best way to break free of a blackmailer? You come clean, and you come clean with the people that the information matters to the most. Now that's hard, because the people that matters to the most are the ones who are going to be most wounded by whatever this person is wielding against you. But you weather that storm, as terrifying as it is. And if you do, the point is you will be far less devastating. The situation will be when the accuser comes calling. What you will have done is have robbed him of his power to manipulate you. Now imagine what it would be like in your life. If you got up tomorrow morning, and had absolutely no fear of failure, or of any one's rejection. Imagine being so secure, in your calling before God that whatever God needed you to do tomorrow, you would be ready to do it. Imagine being able to say it doesn't matter. If the whole world rejects me. If the whole world throws all of my dirt back in my face, because you accept me and you love me and everything that I need for the task you put in front of me, you're gonna provide for me. I'm good to go. Peter found that strength later, when he stood in front of a crowd, after having not been able to confess Christ to a servant girl. With that kind of confidence help you to better help somebody else

Mitch Stevens  33:13
will an awareness of your own dirty feet and the need for their continuous cleansing help you when you're confronted with having to clean up somebody else's embarrassing mess. It makes you a better washer of feet. Do you realize that Jesus washed the feet of Judas Iscariot that night also? A he calls him out. But it's as he's washing feet? How could he have managed that? Knowing what he knew. Going back to my point because his task was not predicated on the way in which it was received. He knew where he was from. He knew where he was going and he was thoroughly equipped. and the Hour is nine. How do we have that confidence when you're immersed for the washing away of your sins, by the promise of Jesus Christ Himself. When that happens, literally and symbolically it gets your head and it gets your hands but literally and symbolically what's the first thing into the water? Your feet then you go all in. So if you're gonna give Him your heart tonight, then you need to start with your feet. If you need to respond to that invitation tonight, to humble yourself in the sight of the Lord, He will wash you and he will lift you up. You need to respond. I hope that you'll take our hand and fellowship that you'll join us tonight. in a special way so that we might all be strengthened and encouraged in our journey to heaven if you do need to come forward please do so we'll be standing alone we
