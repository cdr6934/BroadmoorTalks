Good morning to all. It's good we could be together again after a week of snow, ice, cold temperatures. So you know, my wife and I have done work in other nations for a few decades and work in Jamaica, Philippines, Malaysia, they never seasonal. Never see snow. So awesome pictures, a lot of our contacts there, have children out giving snowman. My say you know in winter season, our population increases because we answered dealing snow me in here. So I thought that was kind of funny. Even any of our song books, as given just left us with one of the songs hold two Gods on changing hand. Time is filled with Swift transition, not of Earth, unmoved can stand, build your hopes on things eternal hold to God's unchanging hand. Back last month, we had some good lessons on this idea of holding God's unchanging hand. And so that inspired me to do some writing on that myself. Excellent. I've you are on my mailing list of thoughts for today. And I had an article on that. And now I've expanded on that for our lesson. For this morning. I'm quite sure what we're downtown somewhere. We're walking along among the crowd, we may see a mother and a child walking together hand in hand. So why would that be? It's not that the child cannot stand on her own two feet. Not that she had to walk by herself. But there's some factors that would cause them to hold hands together. And I want us to consider that in our lesson today. And make some spiritual applications to this idea of holding to God's unchanging hand. First of all, I would suggest that holding to God's hand gives us direction. Obviously, five year olds don't know the way around town. Or they might know the way to the candy store or their ice cream shop. But to go to the grocery store, the drugstore doctor's office, whenever the idea how to get there. And so they need some help in doing that. So hand in hand, they stroll with mother leading the way, wherever they're going downtown. Is that a spiritual obligation to this? Obviously, obviously, so Jeremiah 1023. I know, oh, Lord, that a man's way is not in himself. Nor is it in a man who wants to direct his steps. So in that sense, by holding God's hand, we can reach our destination, he will lead us safely to the place where we're going. Other 19 Psalm, Thy Word is a lamp to my feet, and a light to my path. So he leads the way and guides us with a light of the scriptures. A while back my wife and I drove from Atlanta, where we used to live out to Oregon to visit our son and grandchildren out there and visited along the way with other family and other friends and all places where we used to live. We drove some 4000 miles over some way we had never been before. So how do we know how to go? How do we know how to find the place where we're going? Well, obviously we had a map. We had a map and God has given us a map it's called the Bible. Maybe the battery's getting weaker that we're gonna try this one. It's called a Bible. In our nation, I would assume that most homes have a Bible. I think you would agree with that. That's that's probably true in our nation. But the sad part is that in so many homes The owners actually

David Tant  05:03
don't spend much time in reading and meditating upon them. In some homes, even among churchgoers may be a Sunday. So we get the Bible on the shelf, blow the dust off, you know, okay, we're taking the church with us on free, that's been all that have their ideas about this. In most places that can tend to let their pastors or preachers or whatever, you know, tell them what it says, As One girl said, I don't need to read my Bible. My priests tells me what it says. Totally content. Let somebody else tell her what it says. And that's a problem we have. It 59 Jesus said, but in vain do they worship Me, teaching his doctrines, the precepts of men, let them alone, their blind gods with the blind, out of a blind man guides the blind bullshit fall into a pit. Now, he's not talking here about those who had practice Buddhism, or Hinduism or Islam or whatever like that. These are those who claim that they are practicing Christianity, but they have the dogmas and the precepts of men. I've got a whole shelf in my library full of doctrines of men, Baptists, manual, methods, discipline, Catholic Catechism, and on we go. They all teach something different from one another. And they all he saw the difference in the Bible. If they all thought the same thing is in the Bible, we would need them and consider for the first few 100 years, all Christians had was the Word of God. That's all the head. Within a time men began to develop their own ideas and their own interpretations. And so we had to write all these different creed books. 40 According to our well known church, historian Ed Harrell said there are some 42,000 different denominations all claiming to be Christian. Can you imagine 42,000 Different groups claiming to be Christian? Paul went to Santa Maria, breaching their acts 1711. Now these were more noble minded than those in Thessalonica. For they receive the word with great eagerness, examining the scriptures daily, to see whether these things were sold. Remember, Paul is an apostle of God, he's inspired. And so I think he'd be offended if people got out their own Bibles and began to check out what he's saying. Now, he said, they were noble. They were noble, because they checked out what I was saying, to be sure, it was true as to what the Word of God was saying. Revelation 717, for the lamb in the center of the throne shall be the shepherd, and shall guide them to springs of the water of life. He gives direction to us. The guy says, another quality we see in this, of a mother holding your child's hand is safety. That's a form of it. And that works in two ways. First place, it keeps them from being separated when you were a bit held crowd of people, and your five year old wanders away, we get lost. You're trying to find them. Second quality. It keeps someone from snatching the child. There are those who go about to try to kidnap the child statured away. But if mother has got a good hold on the child's hand, then the child is secure, cannot be taken away. In reruns passages. The Lord has also promised us safety. Psalm four verse eight. In peace, I will both lie down and sleep for thou alone, oh Lord, does make me to dwell in safety to dwell in safety.

David Tant  09:51
Fanny Crosby wrote some of the songs and our song book had a song titled hold down my hand the first time Hold on my hand, so weak I am and helpless. Do not take one step without Band Aid. Hold on my hand for them all loving Savior, no dread of ill shall make my heart afraid, a reference to the idea of safety. Christ made a promise to those who will cling to God's hand. John 1029 My father, who has given them to me, is greater than all, and no one is able to snatch them out of the Father's hand. So we hold on to his hand, and no one can snatch us away. Even the little child, hold her mother's hand Deuteronomy seven, as Israel, people are about to enter into the promised land after their years of sojourn after being in Egypt. They were fearful. There are many powerful nations inhabiting the land. So when the Lord your God shall bring you into the land where you are going to enter into possess it, and shall clear away many nations before you, the Hittites, the Gurkha, shots of the MRIs of the Canaanites, and the parasites on the Hivites, the JV sides, seven nations greater and stronger than you, and with the Lord, your God shall deliver them before you, and you shall defeat them, then you should already destroy them. You shall make no covenant with them, and show no favor, show no favor to them. Then go on verses 17 through 19. If you should say in your heart, these nations are greater than I, how can I dispossess them, you should not be afraid of them. You shall well remember what the Lord your God did to Pharaoh into all Egypt, the great trials which Your eyes saw in the science and the wonders, and the mighty hand, and the outstretched arm, by which the Lord your God brought you out, so shall the Lord your God do to all the peoples of whom you are afraid, they had no reason to fear, because they were holding on to God's hand, the Romans 831, What then shall we say to these things, if God is for us, who is against us the words of another song they're familiar with, written by Fanny Crosby back in the 1870s. That's on the safe, and the arms of Jesus, safe on his gentle wrist, thereby his love or shouted sweetly, my soul shall rest. Another factor of holding on to hand is that of comfort. The world around us, the world around us, presents many challenges. And many live in fear for the violence even in our own nation. There are many areas and I'm thankful that in our area, were saved from that. Of course, last year, we had the explosion, the bombing in downtown Nashville, I don't really know the motive of the one who did that. Except we're thankful that it did see to it that lives were not lost. Just great destruction of property. In many parts of the world, Muslim extremists are slaughtering 1000s of believers in God, day after day, day after day. But there's a remedy for all this. There is a remedy and that is found in Christ to comfort us in all our afflictions. Did you ever see a small child run to a parent and wrap our arms around him? Because of fear? Why do they do that? They know they'll be comforted. They know there'll be comforted. And we have a parent who comforts us. We have a parent who comforts us, our heavenly Father 23rd Psalm, a verse For ledger to us. Even though a walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for thou art with me. The raw staff, they comfort me under 19 song verse 50. This is my comfort in my affliction. That word has revived me

David Tant  14:55
among all the disciples of Christ and that first century If you were to list those who suffered the most in following him, which one would you pick out? I think maybe the Apostle Paul would be at the top of the list, who suffered so greatly. Consider what Paul wrote to the church at Corinth Second Corinthians One, blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies, and the God of all comfort, who comforts us in all our affliction. So that we may be able to comfort those who are in any affliction, with a comfort with which we ourselves are comforted by God. For just at the sufferings of Christ are ours in abundance. So also our comfort is abundant through Christ. You notice the words the word comfort, there's use six times, six times. In those three verses, Paul had a great understanding of the comfort we receive in Christ. And I can't think of a better time when one would need the comfort of Christ anymore than we are beaten. And when we're in Brisbane. Remember, Paul and Silas were in prison in Philippi. They were beaten, stripped. But in prison, the feets put in stocks. And what happened at 1622. The crowd rose together against them, and the chief magistrates tore their robes off him, and proceeded to order them to be beaten with rods, and when they inflated many blows upon them, and they threw them into the prison, commanding the jailer to guard them securely. And he having received such a command and threw them into the inner prison and fasten their feet in the socks. But about midnight, Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns of praise to God, and the prisoners, religion to them. They were on there weeping and mourning and wondering while there's what happened to them, about midnight, they were praying and singing hymns to God. And I'm sure the other preachers were thinking, What in the world is going on? Cause you remember that there was an earthquake, that changed the minds relieves the jail doors were open. And they ran out. The jail was about to commit suicide, because that's a part of the law that if you if prisoners escaped under your watch, then then your life is taken. Do yourself no harm. We're all here. And before long, they baptized the jailer in his household. What a lesson the jailer learned from these men to the comfort they had through their Heavenly Father.

David Tant  18:18
There is joy Have you ever seen that smile on the child's face when they see their father or mother from whom they've been separated for a time? It may be when they get off the school bus. And mom or dad is waiting for them. When they run up, to give them a hug, and then hand in hand, they walk back home. Look what David said about God's presence, Psalm 1611 That will make known to me the path of life in my presence is fullness of joy. In the right hand, there pleasures evermore Yes, we live in a world filled with troubles, sorrows, trials and violence. But in a sense, God says here take my hand and walk with me and put a smile on your face and not work in Jamaica

David Tant  19:33
they have what are called lively choruses. Little short songs that they love to sing Ardo Hamlet there are there may be hundreds of them. One of them says smile a while and give you face wrist. We often seen that at the close of his service. Smile while you face arrest. then shake hands those nearby and give us miles those you know the best something like that exact words you know a smile always looks better than a frown doesn't it? All it looks better than a frown. So God says here take my hand and put a smile on your face. He doesn't want us to go about with a sad look on our face look like we just smoked a pickle. That's not my characterizes us. Some other trials overcome them and they'd go around with a sad face with a woe is me face look all the time. And there is no joy there is no smile. The word joy is found in the Bible 170 times and the word rejoice 140 445 times. So there must be some application to us, even as it was the days of Israel, Nikon Second Chronicles 29. Moreover, King Hezekiah and the officials ordered the Levi's to sing praises to the Lord with the words of David. And as of this year, so they sang praises with joy and bowed down and worshiped. 100 The 16th Psalm, verse 11 That will make known to me the path of life, in my presence is fullness of joy, in the right hand, their pleasures evermore. Now, if we were to pick out another Bible character, one who suffered the most of any Bible character, whether Old or New Testaments, I think we would agree that a fella named job will be at the top of the list. In a moment of time, he lost it in children strong came to destroy their house where they were having a party birthday party lost his cattle, his sheep, oxen, his camels, most all the servants were killed except those who came to tell him with the news. In time he lost his health. In tiny loss of support his wife she said Joe won't just curse God and die get it all over with their three friends came to comfort him or what comfort they gave. Joe Have you should have fooled us We thought you were a godly man. But you really must have done a lot bad for all this to happen to us. We got to see in this trouble to you. He had a lot. He had a lot to mourn about.

David Tant  22:48
But there was something he rejoiced about job 16 It is still my consolation. And I rejoice in unsparing pain. That I have not denied the words of the Holy One are rejoice that have not denied the words of the Holy One. And back to Paul, in a prison cell flipping to 17. But even if I am being poured out as a drink offering upon the sacrifice and service of your faith, rejoice and share my joy with you all. Some years ago, that group of us went to the Bible lands we stayed in a hotel that was a few 100 years old. In some kind of building they converted into a place for tourists to stay now I went to the clerk one day office clerk and I said can you tell me where the memory teen prison is? He pointed about two blocks away as a prison where Paul was were Paul was so the group of us I don't know 15 or 20 others walked through this prison they still there you go in ground level you climb downstairs one level below ground then you go down the stairs to two levels the two levels below the ground and they were prison cells there were Paul was

David Tant  24:57
not very pleasant pleased And we stood there. I thought in my mind and I started leading us on faith of our fathers in prisons dark. And the tears began to flow as we thought of the apostle Paul, possibly even in this cell, writing a letter writing the letter Yes, there are many trials or tribulations in the life. But we anticipate what is to come, First Peter, one, eight and nine. And though you have not seen him, you love him. And though you do not see him now, but believe in Him, you greatly rejoice with joy inexpressible and full of glory. Obtaining is the outcome of your faith, the salvation of your souls. And we have all of this. If we're holding to God's hand if you're here this morning, and you don't have all of these blessings, God extends his hand to you. If you follow and walk with Him, those joyful words we will ever hear would be those spoken by our Lord. Judgement Day, Matthew 25. Then the King will say to those on his right, Come, you who are blessed with my Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world. I pray that all of us may choose to be holding on to God's hand. If somehow you let go and don't have a firm clasp on his hand. Why don't you return to the Lord? If you're not a Christian, remember ties into Christ. He extends his hand to you and invite you to come. He he was believed and have been the time shall be saved. Who was disbelieved shall be condemned. If you're suddenly thrown the invitation. Won't you come as we stand together and sing the song
