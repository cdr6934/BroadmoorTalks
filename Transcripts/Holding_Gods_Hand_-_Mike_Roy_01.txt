As we continue to spend time in worship this morning and praising God and reading His word, we want to focus our minds on him on his power on his grace and strengthen He gives us to serve him each day of our lives. And so as we come into this new year, still facing a lot of challenges, we want to keep our focus on God and put our trust in Him. You know, through the years, we have come up with a number of different themes for this congregation in the last five years or so I needed some help and recalling these recently, but you might remember back in 2016, our theme was be a brighter light. I think that helped us to let our light shine in a dark world. 2017 It was Kingdom citizens were citizens of God's kingdom belong to his family, his church. And then in 2019, our theme was faithful stewards, I still remember the graphic that Brian put together the the workers in the field, faithfully carrying out there task 2019, we talked about been focused on being raised with Christ. And it gives us again, that perspective to keep our mind on things above, not on the things of this world. And then last year, we focused on with our theme, seeing Jesus, I would say, if there was ever a year in which we needed help keeping our eyes on Jesus, it was certainly 2020. And so themes are very helpful. I think they're powerful, they help us to stay focused on what's most important. Also, I want to thank Brian for all the creative graphics that he came up with through the years as we've been developing these themes. I think that image of looking through those dark black rimmed glasses for 2020 won't fade from my mind anytime soon. So thank you, Brian, for putting together those, those graphics. And so after much thought and discussion among the preachers and elders, we have decided that this year's theme is holding God's hand. And that will be our theme for 2020. And I suggest to each of us this morning, that this is a simple phrase. But it contains power, a powerful truth or powerful truths. And so we want us to focus on this particular theme this year, the whole idea that we hold God's hand in and out of trial and difficulty with the ups and downs of life calm, that we keep our hands in his grasp. And, and so throughout the year, what we've been doing with these themes is each of the preachers and elders will maybe have an opportunity to preach on some aspect of what it means to be holding God's hand. And again, it's profound what we seen, we sing the songs, appreciate those songs that Gil lit for us this morning. But we, we make these statements and sing the songs hold to God's unchanging hand. But in fact, it is profound truth there that we need to be thinking about. And so this morning, that's what we're going to be doing is kind of introducing this theme for 2021. And even wondered if we should wait and do this when we have an assembly. But I thought to myself, well, you know, this is just, this typifies what's going on again, this year, and last year that we face challenges, lots of sickness. Again, that's why we're not meeting here in person today. struggles, still political challenges in our country. If ever we needed a message of hope and strength, this is it. So I thought, let's go ahead and introduce this theme that we want to be holding God's hand every day of our lives, we face the ups and downs that come our way. And so this morning, obviously, it's a different type of lesson. But to kind of give you somewhat of a breakdown, I'm going to be looking at Isaiah chapter 41. That's really the text of this lesson. And Isaiah chapter 41, especially verse 10, will kind of be like the the key verse throughout the year that many of us will be focusing on focusing on, there'll be many others as well. I want to convey kind of a main thought or, or objective that this theme is going to do for us. And then let's talk about some implications of what it means to hold god's hands if we're holding God's hand. What does that mean? What are the implications of that? And then I want to help us visualize these truths. So let's look quickly This is Isaiah chapter 41. I'm going to introduce some of these things come back to them in just a few minutes. But Isaiah chapter 41, we just read this a minute ago. And

Mike Roy  04:29
God is telling us through Isaiah, do not fear from with you, do not be dismayed from your God, I will strengthen you and help you. Then he says, I will uphold you with my righteous right hand. And then come then we're going to come back to this person a few minutes. And verse 13. He says, For I am the Lord your God who takes hold of your right hand. So I want you to think about that. God says to us, God says to Isaiah, I will uphold you with my righteous right hand, and I'm going to take hold of your right hand. So God takes His righteous, just faithful right hand and grabs hold of our right hand. So this phrase that the right hand of God or holding the hand of God is found throughout scripts here, and Isaiah chapter 42. And again, without going into all the details here, this tends to be what we call a Messianic Psalm. And God is using Isaiah obviously to reach people with a message of hope, and trust and strength. And, and ultimately, Jesus is the fulfillment of that as he's a light to the nations. He brings people out of the dungeons in the darkness of sin and the prison of sin. But again, there's the phrase who verse six, he says, I am the Lord, I have called you in righteousness, I will also hold you by the hand and watch over you. So again, there's a distinct and specific promise to God, from God, for us, for his people, for His Son, Jesus in the mission that he accomplished. God says, I will hold you by the hand and watch over you. And in Psalm chapter 18. And here's another relevant verse, Psalm, Psalms, chapter 18, verses 33 through 36. This is David's Psalm, when he was praising God for his deliverance from his enemies, especially from the hand of Saul. And again, just quickly, the text says, and it makes my feet like deers feet. He sets me up on the high places or my high places, he trains my hands for battles, so that my arms can bend a bow of bronze. You have also given me the shield of your salvation. And there's the phrase again, and your right hand upholds me. Your right hand upholds me. And your gentleness makes me great. I was looking at the meaning of that word gentleness, I think earlier this morning, and has the idea of condescension. And we say, well, what does that mean? It means that God has Condon said that he descended from heaven to earth, and he'd stoops to our lowly estate, and he holds us up. And he holds up my right hand and your right hand. And so the truth there is that God's right hand upholds us. So again, we see the phrase, the hand of God holding his hand, the right hand of God, God holding our right hand. And it reminds us the challenge is for us every day of our lives, to learn to hold on to God's hand. That's why the theme this year is holding God's hand. So go back to the we'll put this back up on the screen in just a moment, and Isaiah chapter 41. But this is my this is kind of the main point of this particular theme, at least my perspective of that I want you to think about this, because this is worth an awful lot to each one of us. I want to suggest to each of us that when you hold the hand of God, you have divine strength to face and overcome all fears, trials, temptations and burdens. There is nothing that you cannot face and overcome. When you're holding the hand of God. Powerful. No one else can give us that kind of strength. I get strength from you, I get strength from my family, and we give that to each other. But that's the point that I'm making that when we hold God's hand, we can go through darkness, sickness, suffering, sand, fear, failure, grief loss, you name it, it doesn't matter. He walked with us through the valley of the shadow of death, as David talked about in Psalm 23. So this is worth writing down maybe is one of your goals or thoughts, putting in your phone or your computer, whatever you might want to do. But when we hold God's hand, we have, we have heavenly strength, we have divine strength to overcome anything and everything. So think about that. That's kind of like an anchor message to this particular lesson. So let's go back to our text.

Mike Roy  08:51
And just a moment and Isaiah chapter 41, and looks specifically at what God is saying over there. But again, as we think about the this particular passage, I want to get one of us again to think about some of the implications of what it means to hold God's hand. Well, obviously it means if we hold God's hand, that means we're near to him, we're close to God. So if you're holding the hand of God, that means we're very, very close to him. But think of implies that we might be walking with God. So if we hold God's hand, it's kind of a picture of of a person with God walking hand in hand with God. Also, it conveys the idea of fellowship with God, the greatest fellowship that we can have is with our Savior with our God in heaven. So if we hold God's hand seems to me that we're in fellowship with Him, we're walking with him. And even beyond that. I can base the sense of intimacy with God. That's really what we need to overcome the difficulties and challenges that we face in life. We need to stay in constant intimacy with God the closer we get to God The stronger we become, the more holy we become the purer Our hearts are. So holding God's hand implies this real intimacy. And that's the thing that, that all of us hunger, for, we have that to some degree in our marriages with our family and the closest. And that's wonderful, but nothing compares with the intimacy that come from holding God's hand walking with Him, serving Him, trusting Him, trusting his promises. Again, one of the implications of holding God's hand is strength, our God is a God of all strength. And if we hold the hand of God, we have access to the access to the God of all strength, his strength becomes my strength, his strength becomes your strength. And so again, we begin to think about the implications of this simple phrase holding God's hand, it means I have his strength. In fact, in Ephesians, chapter six, we're told to take up the full armor of God, it says, Be strong in the Lord, and then the strength of His might. He's saying that God is strong, and he wants us to be strong. So when we hold his hand, nobody can break that nobody can pull us down, we can choose to walk away, obviously people can from from God. But when you're holding God's hand, there's nobody who can discourage you to the point of giving up your faith. Again, when we hold God's hand, we have access to infinite love, I want you to think about that. When we hold God's hand, we're walking with holding hands with the God of all love. And then also, when we hold God's hands, or hold, hold his hands, we have access to his grace and power. So this is, this is profound. These are profound truths that come from this simple statement, which is our theme for 2021 that we want to be holding God's hand every day of our life we'll talk about then how do we accomplish that, but these are some implications that I want us to think about. I'm going to go into that a little bit further in just a moment. But now, so I have said a few minutes ago, let's go back to our text. So Isaiah, chapter 41, verses 10 through 13 is really the key text, at least it is from my lesson. And I think this will be kind of like an anchor verse for our themes. This our theme this year in many will be maybe speaking from various elements of this. So again, think about the fact that God's people are in Babylonian captivity, they're in during tremendous trials and difficulties. And God reminds them that I have called you, I've chosen you, you are mine, yes, you're struggling. You're in difficulty. You're in trial, but you are my child, you belong to me. So what does God say over here? First, he says, because God Hicks calls his people and loves his people, he says, so do not fear. Before we go too far, much further from that, I want us to say that God does not want us to live in fear. God does not want us to be afraid how many of us through much of our lives at different times in our lives, live with fear, and anxiety, and all that kind of stuff. But the point I make is, when we're holding the hand of God, He does not want us to be afraid he does not want us to live our lives in fear. And yet, as human beings with our weaknesses, we very often spend much of our lives in fear or worry, that type of thing. But what's the reason you look at this text over here, because this is our key text that we want to focus in on. What's the reason God says so do not fear. The reason is for I am with you. God could have said, you know, I've

Mike Roy  13:49
got some good servants down there. And you know, a preacher over here and one of the elders over here, you get a great song leader, and he can encourage you or the sister who, you know, encourages some of the, the sickness shut in. But he said the reason that we are not to be afraid, the reason that we are to not live in fear because I am with you. I am your God, I am bigger than your fears is what God is telling the exiles. And he's saying the same thing to you and I that no matter what's going on our lives, God does not want us to be strapped by fear and be hindered by that. And so it's the reminder, he's saying over here that I am with you. So no matter what's going on, again, whether it's captivity, whether it's the grief of sin, whether it's some type of sickness, and we know about sickness from this past year. God says, Don't be afraid. I'm with you. I am with you. If God is with you, then you don't need anyone else to walk alongside you. And that's what he's saying over you. And I think back when I was in high school, up and growing up a man Massachusetts, I went to a trade school and that was not a big guy back then I know it's kind of hard for you to think about that. But anyway, when I was a freshman and sophomore, seems like the juniors and seniors to pick on me remember when they go into the locker room and get get my books, and oh, there's Roy, there's Mike. And so these seniors picked me up, one guy picked me up on my belt loops, you know, broke the belt loop. And they were trying to intimidate me, maybe it wasn't a totally serious thing to threaten me. But at the same time, in that school, one of the seniors with my sister's boyfriend at that time, his name was Steven and Steven came up to me said, Michael, he said, if anybody ever tries to intimidate you, or bring you harm, just let me know. And word got out. And he had some discussions with some of these guys and tried to rearrange some facial features and type of thing, not literally. But anyway, after my friend who said, I'm with you, no matter where you're going, they never bother me again. And so the point is, when God says, I am with you, that there's no reason for us to live in fear. And then he says, so do not be dismayed. Don't be discouraged, don't be, don't give in to your fears, and your and your worries. And again, the reason he's saying that is because he says, For I am your God. And so that's the point that we make over here that God is trying to convey to his people convey to the, his his people in captivity and convey to us as well. That we are not to live in fear, we should not be dismayed because he could God says, I am your God. And then he says, I will strengthen you, I will help you. And then he says, I will uphold you with my righteous right hand. So three times they were released, I think five times. And that verse is the personal pronoun, referring to God. And what he's really saying over here, that he is trying to give the highest level of assurance and confidence to his people. He said, The reason that we are not to live in fear and worry, and dismay is because God is our God. And he obviously loves us. He's called us, and He promises to be with us. And he's going to strengthen us, in fact, that says, I will uphold you with my righteous right hand.

Mike Roy  17:23
And that conveys again, the idea of faithfulness, God is faithful, he's not going to leave us he's not going to abandon us during sickness, or suffering or grief or loss. And so we read this and sometimes read past it too quickly. But the point I make here, is there any higher constellation that we can reach the receiver at greater assurance, and that we can have of intent to know that, that God is with us? And that's the that's the very point that he makes to us. And I think when we asked the question, why such repetition, so we look over here might jump down to the bottom of that text, but in verse 11, he said, All who rage against you will surely be ashamed and disgraced. Those who oppose you will be as nothing in Paris, those who search for you, though you search for your enemies, you will not find them. Those who wage war against you will be as nothing at all. And again, verse 13, for I am the Lord your God, God can't, can't give any greater testimony or assurance, other than the fact that he is God. And that was what his message was to Abraham, when he gave those promises that the writer of Hebrews talks about in chapter six. He said, he could not swear by anyone greater than themselves. We swore by Himself, He said, I am your God, I'm going to fill fulfill these promises. It's impossible for God to lie. And so that gives us the greatest assurance and confidence possible, to know that God is there for us through the ups and downs of life. And so again, there's that repetition, fry the Lord your God, I am the Lord your God who takes hold of your right hand. So it's interesting back in verse 10, he says, that I will uphold you with my righteous right hand. And then in verse 13, I'm going to take hold of your right hand, to the hell by the right hand of God, when He connects with our right hand is incredible encouragement. It's even maybe hard for us to fathom a god so great and so holy, so loving, reaching down to me and holding me back by the hand and then again, the message and verse 13, and it says to you, do not fear Do not be afraid, I will help you and again, so why such repetition? Obviously, God's trying to give us greater assurance. Also, one reason for this, this repetition, is because we are so often doubtful, right? We're fearful we're anxious, and we we tend not to take God at His Word. This is a plain promise of God to be with us to strengthen us to help us with his presence. And he wants us to believe that. And so often I feel like what Jesus says to the crowds and the Sermon on the Mount, oh ye of little faith. And I think that is our challenge. So, so Isaiah chapter 41, there's so much more we could talk about there. But I want us to focus on that, to think about that. And then let's talk about some implications of these truths. I just again, by way of

Mike Roy  20:34
reinforcement, and as we think about, what does it mean to be holding God's hand? Well, when we hold the hand of God, once you think about this, when we hold the hand of God, we hold the hand of perfect, infinite love. That's staggering to think about. And it's hard to fathom. When you hold the hand of God, you are holding in your hands, the one who possesses perfect, infinite, matchless love. That'll change your life just thinking about that. And that's what we're challenging each of us to do. There's so many verses we could look at. And First John chapter four and verse 16, says, and so we know and rely on the love God has for us. And there's the phrase and verse 16, God is love. And and we don't have any fear in the Day of Judgment, he were perfected in our love, it drives out fear and all that type of thing. But the the message here is that God is love. And when you hold the hand of God, you are holding love personified in your hand and verse 19. He said, We'd love because he first loved us. So we learn to love because God loved us. If we claim to love God and hate her brother, we're a liar. So the conclusion there. last part of verse 19, anyone who loves God, must also love their brother and their sister, we must love our brethren. So again, think about that with me, as we focus on this theme. Holding God's hand means practically, that you are holding the hand of, of perfect and infinite love compelling thought for us to think about. Another second idea that I want us again to think about, when we hold the hand of God, we have access to the God of all grace. So in First Peter, chapter five, Peter, look at the phrase and how many times this phrase comes up in, in Scripture. And First Peter, chapter five, verse six, he said, Therefore Humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God, there it is, again, the hand of God almost said, every turn of the page, humble yourself into the mighty hand of God, that he may exalt you in due time, Casting all your care upon Him, for he cares for you, he tells us, He tells us to be vigilant to be sober, are ever say the devil walks around like a roaring lion seeking to devour us. He said, resist him firm in your faith are steadfast in your faith, knowing that the same sufferings are experienced by your brotherhood in the world. And they said, but may the God of all grace He called us to his eternal glory, there's again the same message of Isaiah, God has called us to eternal glory, He knows the sufferings, he knows the trials, he knows the sickness, he knows the enemies that may rise up against us. But he says, May the God of all grace who called us to his eternal glory by cries, after you have suffered for a while, perfect, establish, strengthen and settle you. So again, what we're saying when we we slow down for just a minute and think about the implications of this, this truth, holding God's hand, when we hold the hand of God, we are holding the hand of the God of all grace, as a stunning again, thought to think about, and that's what we're challenging each one of us to think about in this new year. The third implication that I want us to look at from this, this lesson, this suggests that we hold the hand of God, we're able to walk with Him, there is such a sublime thought to think about walking with God, we sometimes sing about that. Genesis chapter five, verses 21 through 24, the well known story of Enoch, this could be another text that somebody wants to take this year in mind more deeply. So the Enoch lived 65 years and begat Methuselah after he begat Methuselah Enoch. It says Enoch walked with God 300 years. Wow. So Enoch distinguishes himself from really anyone else there.

Mike Roy  24:50
That he is a man who walked with God for 300 years and had sons and daughters. So all the dates of Enoch were 365 years look, verse 24. Aynak walked with God against her mentioned that truth again. And he was not for God took him. So when we walk with God, it enables us to to, to hold his hand to walk side by side with him to be encouraged by him. So just think about that and the challenges that we face in this life. When we hold the hand of God, we are in effect walking with him. And if we thought about that, on a daily basis, we hit off the work or school or whatever we might be doing the soccer field at a basketball court or anything else. When we hold God's hand, we are walking with him. Again, there's nothing that can overcome us. It's an interesting phrase there. So Enoch walked with God for 300 years, and he was not for God took him the New King James Version says over here of what's kind of interesting thing to think about I think what happened here in this scenario is that God is walking with Enoch and Indyk is walking with God. And Indyk is walking with God for 300 years. And God kind of looked at intercasino. Enoch, we've been walking together so long, and you got to know me so well, you're so much closer to my home, then you work then you are once you just come home with me. kind of seems like I'm not sure that's an exact way to translate that. But I think that's what he's saying that Enoch walked with God for 300 years got so close to God, God grabbed him and said, You're coming home with me? Wow, what a thought to think about can we walk with God? Surely we can. And when we hold God's hand, that really implies that we are walking with him. A fourth point that I want to make this morning is that when we hold the hand of God, we become more and more like him. Look at this second Corinthians chapter three, verses 17 and 18. This is not talking about holding God's hand, but in this context, is looking at his face and looking at his word and thinking about him. You said, Now the Lord is a spirit, with a spirit of the Lord is there's liberty. But we all with unveiled face beholding as in a mirror the glory of the Lord of being transformed into the same image, from glory to glory. So again, the principle is when we, when we gaze at the face of God and be consistently and continuously gaze at his face, we become more like Him. And when we walk next to him, and read His Word, and hold him and hold his hand. And obviously, if you're holding hands with somebody, whether it's your spouse, or your children, we become more like those that we walk with, and talk with and hold hands with. So when we hold the hand of God, we become more like Him. And that is the goal for God to change me into becoming more like him. One of the points that I want to make actually a couple before we make some final applications here. When we hold the hand of God, we overcome our enemies, and God helps us to overcome them. So Exodus chapter 15, verse three said that the Lord is a warrior, a warrior, the Lord is his name. Pharaoh's chariots in his army, he has cast into the sea and the choices of his offices are drowned in a Red Sea, the deep cover them, they went down to the depths like a stone, and verse six, he says, Your right hand, oh, Lord is majestic in power. So if God's hand his right hand is majestic, empower, then take hold of it. Your right hand is majestic and power, your right hand, oh, Lord shatters the enemy, the enemies. So the point I'm making here is that when we hold the hand of God, we are able to overcome our enemies, overcome difficulties, overcome adversity, whatever is coming our way. Look at another thought with me before we raised a practical question in the last section here, how do we hold God's hand?

Mike Roy  28:55
And I want to suggest this to you from this from Romans chapter eight. When we hold the hand of Jesus in particular, we hold the hand that one who is it God's right hand interceding for us. So in Romans chapter a, again, Paul's trying to encourage these Christians to keep their faith and not to give up and face of adversity? And he said, What shall we say then to these things of God is for us? Who can be against us? He who did not spare His own Son, but gave him up for us all? How will He not also with Him graciously give us all things? Who shall bring any charge against God's electives, God who justifies who is to condemn Christ Jesus is the one who died more than that, who was raised and who is at the right hand of God who enters who is interceding for us. So again, a very profound and sublime truth and when we hold the hand of God, when we hold the hand of Jesus Christ, as we walk in this life, we are holding the hand of the very One who sat down at God's right hand and who is interceding for you today and for me. So again, very powerful thoughts to think about. And we need to be thinking about those more and more on a regular basis. So again, the implications of this truth that we're talking about, I think are profound. But just think about that. When you hold Jesus's hand, the hand of God, the hand of Jesus Christ, you're holding the hand of the very One who sat down and finished his work. He's at God's right hand in these interceding for you and me very powerful. Well, let's think about, again, what does it mean? The big question is, okay, my understand the need for us to be holding God's hand is still somewhat, maybe hard to grasp, and how do we apply that? How? That's the big question, how do we hold God's hand, I want to suggest for things that we hold God's hand by holding on to his promises, by holding on to his people by holding on to prayer. And by holding on to his words, we'll look I'm going to look at some scriptures quickly for each of these. So how do we hold on to God's hand? Well, by holding on to his promises, when Paul told young Timothy in First Timothy, chapter six, fight the good of the good fight of the faith, he said, Take hold of grab hold of the eternal life to which you were called, there's a calling again, Isaiah says it. Jesus says, God is saying it. Paul, say it to Timothy, we've been called into God's presence. Peter talked about that, in Paul's telling younger Timothy, grab hold of eternal life. That is that eternal life is one of the greatest promises that God has given to us. It's our choice, we, we hold on to that promise. And that's one of the ways that we hold God's hand. When we hold on to his promises, like kind of the JB Phillips translation puts it, it says, Keep your grip on that life eternal. And the challenge for us is to keep a tighter grip on God's hand. But in particular, we cling to His promises, we stand on the promises of God. So that's one way that we hold God's hand. Secondly, I would suggest that we hold God's hand when we hold on to his people. So in Luke chapter one, when Chris Naomi is a widow, now she tells her daughters in law to go back home to Moab Orpah, kissed her mother in law, but Ruth clung to her. And she said, See, your sister in law has gone back to her people, and to for God's return after your sister in law. But Ruth said, do not urge me to leave you to return from following you for where you go, I will go and where your lodge, I will lodge and what is Ruth, say about Naomi, and your people will be my people. And your God, My God, one of the ways that we hold on to God's hands by holding on to his people. And here's again, the old sisters principle that Ruth clung to her mother law. And so there's the that's against stresses the importance of connecting with each other. And of course, we're dealing with this virus and the implications of that, but getting together in being connected to God's people. That's what helps each of us developing their relationships with one another. When we hold on to each other, then we hold on to God's promises,

Mike Roy  33:33
excuse me in the truth of His Word. And that's why when we come together, whether it's here in the building or yard assembly, we often sometimes might even hug each other from a distance, because we're trying to stay close to each other. A third way that we hold on to God's hand is through prayer. And so Paul says in Ephesians, chapter six and verse 18, through 20, and pray in the Spirit on all occasions, with all kinds of prayers, and requests with this in mind, be alert. And always keep on praying for all the Lord's peoples it pray for me, that when I speak words may be given to me that I'll fearlessly make known the mystery of the gospel, for which I'm an ambassador and chain. So here again, how do we hold God's hand? Well, we hold God's hand when we hold on to prayer, don't give up praying, and prayer is our lifeline lifeline to God and heaven. So one of the ways that we hold God's hand is by continuing to pray and not being faint or giving up with that. One of the point is we think about the question, how do we hold God's hand? Well, obviously we hold God's hand by holding his word that he wrote with the finger of God, we think about the law of Moses. So Joshua, again is being given some very strong instructions, he said, be very strong. Be careful to obey all that was written in the book The Law of Moses without turning aside to the right or to the left, we stressed that. This is not legalism. And this is not self righteousness or anything like this. This is how you stay strong. By holding on to God, we're being careful to obey what's written in the book of the law, in Joshua's case, the law of Moses, not turning to the right or turning to left, not getting involved with the nations around us. And it says you must not serve them or bow down to them in verse eight. Excuse me, he said that you are to hold fast to the Lord your God. So we hold so we hold fast to the Lord our God by holding fast to his word. And so I think this answers the question how we hold on to God, how do we hold his hand? How do we walk with them? When we hold on to his promises, we hold on to his people, we hold on to prayer. And we hold on to his word, I want to leave with one of the Scripture before we bring the lesson to a close. This is Psalm chapter 16, and verses 1711. It's quoted in the New Testament referring to Jesus, but again, listen to what the psalmist says, over here. And the point here is where does Where does, holding God's hand lead us to what's the conclusion here. And that's our conclusion this morning. The psalmist says, Our blessed the Lord has given me counsel, my heart also instructs me in their night seasons, I have set the Lord always before me, because he is in my right hand. David says because God's my right hand I shall not be moved, Therefore my heart is glad my glory rejoices by flesh also will rest in hope. You won't leave my soul and she'll, she'll normally Allah allow Your Holy One to see corruption. Verse 11, you will show me the path of life in Your presence is fullness of joy. And look at verse, the last part of verse 11, at your right hand, are pleasures forever more. Psalm chapter 16, in verse 11, at God's right hand, if you're holding his hand, he's holding yours, at God's right hand, our eternal pleasures. That's where holding God's hand will lead you into the very presence of God, to experience and enjoy pleasure beyond the human imagination. There's nothing in this world that compares in terms of pleasure with what God has in store for us. So this is where holding God's hand leads us into and we've chosen this theme for this year. And hopefully, that will consciously work hard at doing those things that applying these things that I've talked about this morning. We'll be sharing various lessons throughout the year we've done in the past as we focus on holding God's hand hoping that the lesson will be helpful and encouraging to each of us as we move into 2021 and let us embrace the challenge to take God by the hand.
