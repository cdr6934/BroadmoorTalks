Good morning. It's good to see everyone here today as chance mentioned, we may be few in number, but it's always good to be able to worship together. And we are together here this morning. So I'm glad that you're here with me, in order to worship.

We've already mentioned and talked about the fact that this year's theme is holding God's hand, Mike preached on that. Last week, I originally intended to hold off a little bit, maybe wait about a month to hit this theme again. But as the weekend folded I, I changed my mind on what I was going to be preaching on. And I'll talk about that in just a second. So this theme of holding God's hand is really a theme of trust and reliance upon God, in good times, and bad, but but especially in bad times, in the difficult times, we reach out and we hold God's hand, one of our greatest fears in life is really that we would be alone, that we would not be loved, that we would not be known. But with God, that never has to be a reality, we can always hold to God's hand, though the world forsake us or dismiss us, we can hold to God's hand, that we do not see God's form and he does not have a physical hand, we can still reach out to him, we can still know that he is there that he is present, and that He will never leave us or forsake us. When I think about holding hands, one of the images that comes to my mind, and I'm sure it comes to many of yours, as well as that of a child holding the hand of a parent, a parent leading the child by the hand, and especially if they're that toddler, they're not always able to even hold themselves up. And so they hold that hand for stability. And maybe it's even holding the finger as they reach up to hold. You know, as a picture of that. Holding hand we see the presence, the provision and the protection of a parent, a child feels secure and safe when holding the hand of their parents. This year, we're going to be talking about holding God's hand and one thing I thought about this morning, I realized the great need we have for prayer fact we've been talking on on GroupMe, and texting and emailing of the many needs for prayer. And so that's why I decided to change my sermon this morning, I was going to talk about Philippians four, but I decided to talk about holding God's hand in prayer. If we think about a child being led by a parent, I think that that bond is strengthened even more when conversation takes place, when a parent can speak to their child with words of comfort, and love and guidance. And so I'd like to talk this morning about holding God's hand in prayer. When I was dating, Jessica and I went to her house and was there with her family. One of the traditions that that they had is when they prayed, they all held hands together at the table. And so they they all grabbed hands, I appreciated that they were holding hands as they prayed together to God. I think we also have an image of reaching out to God in a sense when we talk to him when we pray to Him, we are holding on to him and holding on to his hand. I think there's some imagery in Scripture that points to this. And it's actually found in one of the passages that Trevor led us in in one of his studies in Psalms. I'd like to look at some of that. First of all, in Psalm 39. This will lead in these are the couple of verses before Psalm 40, which is the one that Trevor led us in but notice what it says in Psalm 39 In verse 12.

Jeremy Sweets  04:16
Hear my prayer, oh Lord, and give ear to my cry. Hold not your peace at my tears. For I am a sojourner with you a guess like all my father's look away from me that I may smile again before I depart and am no more. Here the psalmist says here my prayer. Dear God, listen to me. But notice the next part of that he says For I am a sojourner. I am a sojourner with you. I am walking with you and not only am I walking with you, I asked that you would hear me and I'm walking as a sojourner as a one that is true Traveling one that is in need. And so he says, I'm a sojourner with you. And I think that presents a picture of this idea of prayer, listen to my prayer, but also walking with God Hand in hand, as we move to Chapter or Psalm 14. And the first three verses there, it says, I waited patiently for the Lord, he inclined to me and heard my cry. I think it's no accident that the closing of the previous song says here, my prayer, and the opening of this one says, God heard my prayer. He inclines me and heard my prayer. He drew me up from the pit of destruction out of the miry bog and set my feet upon a rock, making my steps secure. He put a no song in my mouth, a song of praise to our God, many will see in fear and put their trust in the Lord. Notice, he says that God heard my cry, and what did God do? There's no mention of hands here. But it says he drew me up out of the pit. And he placed me on secure ground. And I see God's hand in that image of picking up out of destruction out of turmoil out of the miry bog and setting and placing one upon footing of rock, so that the footing is secure, the steps are secure, and what a new song of praise would come from that one that has been lifted out of the bog and put upon secure footing, a song of praise, many will see and fear and put their trust in the Lord. And that's what we're talking about with holding on to God's hand, putting our trust in Him. And so I think that's a beautiful image there in combination with Psalm 39. And Psalm 40. I want to look at one other image. And that is an image of a posture in prayer. We typically, at least I do kind of instruct my children into a single posture, right, I say, bow your head, put your hands together. And we try to do that to try to get them to prepare for the fact that we are talking to Almighty God. We are concentrating and thinking about what he said. But in Scripture, there are many different postures. And those postures are an expression of, of the heart. And so there's not one prescribed prayer posture in Scripture. In fact, we see that that some fell on their face, they lie prostrate before the Lord, we see that in Joshua chapter seven, right after the defeat at AI, Joshua and the leaders fall on their face before the Lord. We see a bowing of the head, for example, Abraham servant in Genesis 24, and verse 52, bowed his head, or we see a kneeling sometimes in prayer, Psalm 95. And verse six mentions that kneeling, but Solomon, at the dedication of the temple, it says this in First Kings 822, Solomon stood before the altar of the Lord in the presence of all the assembly of Israel, and spread his hands toward heaven. He spread his hands toward heaven, I don't think he was trying to literally hold God's hand. But that expressed the attitude that was in his heart of receiving the the blessings, and particularly there, he talks about the forgiveness, receiving that to God, acknowledging the one that we were talking to, he lifted his hands to God, we don't often do that. And again, there's no prescribed posture and prayer. But I think that reveals his heart of reaching up to God. And that's really the picture that I want to convey this morning, that we are holding God's hand in prayer. And so I think there is rich imagery in scripture of this idea. So who, whose hand are we holding?

Jeremy Sweets  09:17
Who is this God that we are holding? When we hold God's hand in prayer, we recognize something about him about who he is, and about our relationship with him a few points, I think about when I especially if I picture a child holding their hands, the parents of the hand of their parents. Mark, there's someone at the back door, if you want to let them so there there is a picture here of the God whose hand we hold. One of those is that God is near. God is near when a child holds the hand of their parents They recognize and they know that God is near. And Philippians four, verse five, it says this, The Lord is at hand. Do not be anxious about anything but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God. Now what that means when it says The Lord is at hand is the Lord is near the Lord is there, the Lord is present. He is right there. And so we don't have to be anxious or take that anxiety upon ourselves. But in everything with prayer and supplication, we can let our requests be made known to God. And so that's a beautiful picture, God is near. Another image we see is that God hear God hears when a child has the hand of their parent, they recognize that that parent is listening to them. In First John five and verse four, it says, this is the confidence we have in approaching God, that if we ask anything, according to His will, He hears us, a child has full confidence when they are talking that their parent hears them. And if their parents not listening to them, they are eager to repeat our thing. They will repeat and repeat. They have full confidence that their parents hears them. In first Peter three and verse 12, says, For the eyes of the Lord are on the righteous and his ears are open to their prayer God hears, God hears us. And as we hold God's hand, I think we recognize that we also see that God is able, God is able. God's hand is often depicted as a picture of strength and mind. When a child holds their parents hand they they are often enveloped by a bigger hand than their child doesn't have the strength that a parent does. And so they are able to go places and do things that they otherwise would not be able to do, because of the strength of their parents. We see in the Exodus, when Moses reflects upon what God has done, he says this and Deuteronomy four in verse 34, that God demonstrated His hand, or his power by a mighty hand, and an outstretched arm, a mighty hand and an outstretched arm. as we as we hold God's hands, we are holding a mighty hand, a powerful hand, and he is truly able. And First Peter Five, Verse six, it says, humble yourselves, therefore under the mighty hand of God, so and Casting all your anxieties on Him, because He cares for you. And so as we reach out and hold God's hand, we realize his strength, and we're willing to give him our anxieties to unload those off of our shoulders and give those to him that is the God whose hand we hold. And I'm sure as we talk about this year, holding God's hand we're gonna focus on who God is, and why we need to hold his hand. Also want to think about just a few moments about the prayers that we pray. When I think about holding God's hands, I think about that, again, that child holding the the hand of a father, and there are certain prayers that come to mind. The first of those is seeking His wisdom.

Jeremy Sweets  13:48
As a child walks with a parent, they are quick time, ask questions, and seek wisdom. They know that they're that they want to know why things are the way they are. They want to know what is possible. They want to know that they are safe, and that their questions can be answered. And they want to know and they believe that someone has the answers for them. And so they ask these things. They seek wisdom from a parent. In James chapter one and verse five. There it says, if any of you lacks wisdom, let him ask God, who gives generously to all without reproach, and it will be given to him. We lack wisdom, just like that child speaks openly, honestly, and with full confidence in their parents. So we need to talk to God and seek wisdom, as JD Shelburne, this last week. There's anything that I could pray for him about, and guess what he said? You probably guessed it since I'm bringing it up on this point, but he said wisdom. I would like wisdom as I raise eila. To know God, I think many of us want that, don't we? We want wisdom as a parents. We recognize the overwhelming responsibility there. We want wisdom as we're at work. And we're dealing with people that that do not know God. We want wisdom in that we want wisdom as we deal with family matters. And things that go on there we we need wisdom. And so we need to pray to God for wisdom. I know this is a little bit different. But as I'm talking about prayer, I would like to pray with you after each one of these points. And so I'm going to, I'm going to say a prayer at this time, and I would ask that you would bow with me. Dear God, give us wisdom. Help us to be filled with your word, to the light and its precepts and to use its principles in a good and wise way. Help every Christian here, every Christian at Broadmoor to live with integrity toward non Christians, and display the light of the gospel. Give us wisdom as we tell others about you and stand up for what is right. We pray that You would give the elders wisdom as they shepherd the flock here. And as they make decisions for us and guide us. We pray that You would give wisdom to the many parents we have among us as we seek to wisely teach and instruct our children. Give us all wisdom as we navigate the pandemic and we come in contact with others, others who have different views, who have different fears and different thoughts. Give us wisdom, dear Lord, in Jesus name, amen. And so we seek God's wisdom. Another thing a child does as he holds God hand hold the hand of their parents is that child relies on the strength of their parents relies on the strength of their parent. They often go places they couldn't go on their own, but they know they can do it as they hold their parents hand. When the Israelites crossed the Red Sea, they praise God saying The Lord is my strength And my song he has become my salvation. All throughout Scripture we see God is a mighty God, no power, no cumulative power among us. No army can stand in his way or arrival, his power. He is Almighty. In Psalm 23, the Psalmist says The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want I have no need. Again, in Psalm 46 And verse one, God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble. We to recognize our weakness, we to recognize that we do not have everything that we need. As we face this life, we run up against challenges that we do not have enough strength or power to tackle on our own. We are weak and in need. We rely on God's strength and we can convey that in prayer and petition God for strength as well. Would you bow with me as we pray to God, about relying on his strength? Our dear God, we need you every hour. We rely on your strength, your grace, and your mercy and all things. Please give strength to the sick. Those that have contracted the COVID virus. We especially pray that you would be with Jimmy and Debbie low, give them strength and we're praying for them. Please give strength to the Davenport family,

Jeremy Sweets  18:47
the McNatt families they care for their children. Please give strength to the frontline workers Jamie Kim Shan and others among us that that are working in the medical field. Please give strength to the police officers Kevin and Davey in their jobs. Give us all strength, dear Lord, to overcome sin and draw closer to you. Give us all the strength to look beyond ourselves and to reach out to others and their time of need. In Jesus name, Amen. We also pray the prayer of comfort and seeking comfort and solace. When a child walks hand in hand with their father and mother they find great comfort there. In fact, sometimes you'll see some separation anxiety from a very small one if their mother walks by and leaves them they're anxious, aren't they? I have just been left. Of course, mother's only a few feet away. She's right there. But they feel comfort when with their parents. In fact, often when a child falls and hurts themselves, the only medicine they really need is the presence and the acknowledgement of mom In that they're crying. They're in pain. This is never going to go away. Mom says, Oh, I'm sorry. It's okay. You want me to kiss? Yeah, it's all good. And they run away, and they're happy. Children find prep, find comfort in the presence of their father and their mother, and we to find comfort in our great God. In second Corinthians chapter one in verses three and four, there it says, Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of mercies, and God of all comfort, who comforts us in our affliction, so that we may be able to comfort those who are in any affliction, with the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted by God. I hope you see that circle that spiral there, we receive comfort from God, and we are to be an extension of that comfort to other people, as God gives them comfort through us and then they seek to give comfort to others. You see, that circle goes round and round, we receive comfort from God and we seek to give comfort to others. What a beautiful picture. There are many in need of comfort. At this time, I'm sure you recognize that there are many anxieties and many fears. And so we need to pray to God for comfort. Would you bow with me at this time? Father Have mercy, comfort us and our affliction. We pray a special prayer upon those who have lost loved ones. For those who are suffering from illness and feel pain. We pray that you would come for those who are alone or isolated during the pandemic. We pray for the elderly, those in nursing homes, those who cannot receive visitors and know love and warmth, touch and be with those that they love. These include my dad, Mike's mom, Miss Raya, Dave Boyd's mother, we pray for all of these, we pray that she would help each of us to be an extension of comfort, the comfort that you give to us, and help us to comfort others. In Jesus name, Amen. We pray a prayer finding comfort in our God as we hold his hand. We also pray for forgiveness. A child does many things wrong, as they learn as they grow as a maid. Sure, a parent has to guide and instruct them upon what is good. And right. When a child has done something wrong, they'll often get embarrassed. Or maybe they'll simply deny that they did wrong. Or maybe they'll run and hide. All those are trying to avoid the fact that they have done wrong, but after they've been confronted, what they really want to know is that you still love them,

Jeremy Sweets  22:59
and that you still care, and that you forgive them, that they're wrong has not damaged their relationship with you. That's what they really want to know. And isn't that what we really want to know from God when we have sinned against him, we seek to repent of that to call upon him to draw us closer to Him, and to have forgiveness. In First John one in verse nine. It says if we confess our sins, He is faithful and just to forgive us our sins, and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness we see that we desperately need forgiveness from God. And I mentioned this as as a child of God, we initially receive forgiveness of sins when we are baptized and have our sins washed away. But then as a child of God, when we sin against Him, we need to pray and ask for forgiveness. So would you bow with me at this time as we pray to our Heavenly Father? Oh, sovereign God and righteous. Forgive us when we sinned against you. Give us hearts of humility to acknowledge our sin, and forgive us. Give us the courage to confess our sin and forgive us. Give us the strength to do better and draw closer to you. And forgive us. Forgive us of the sins of our ignorance. Help us to come to know what is right and turn away from what is wrong. Help us also to forgive others as you forgive us. In Jesus name, Amen. We need to hold God's hand don't we? And we need to do so in prayer. And I thought it would be helpful this morning to look at the the theme through the lens of prayer and think about that. We sometimes sing a song I haven't sung the song a long time is called in the garden. And that song, we sing this and he walks with me and he talks with me And he tells me I am his own. And the joy we share as we carry there none other has ever known. Prayer is an unbelievable privilege. It's one of the greatest joys that we can recognize that we can know as a child of God, being able to talk to our Father in heaven. And when we do that, we can know that he loves us. And what a great blessing and benefits. That is. If you're here this morning, and you're not a Christian, I'd ask that you would hold God's hand and seek forgiveness in whom you can do that by believing that Jesus is the Christ by repenting of your sins, confessing Jesus's Christ and being baptized in the water for forgiveness of your sins, you can become a child of God and begin that lifelong journey of holding his hand. If you are a Christian, let me encourage you to hold God's hand in all things, and do so fervently in prayer. Because consistently in prayer and faithfully in prayer, let us hold god's hands in all things. If there's any subject to limitation, please come as we stand in scene at this time.
