Good morning. Good to see everyone here today. It's always a blessing to be able to worship with you. So I appreciate the opportunity to do that today. It's always a good day when we can praise God and worship him. I think we can all grow stronger from that when we do that. Can't help but mention that there are several here that I see that have been in our prayers. Oh, baby Andrew was peeking at me while we were seeing in and it's good to see him. I think this is the first time I've seen Andrew in person, I thought a little bit on Zoom. But so good to see him. I see Kathy Donna who and my father in law worshiped with the donor who's at Rocky Point in Memphis. And, and Randy was such a good man. So kind and gentle. And we have prayed for you and your family. Once we see Kevin over here as well, and we are thankful for him, I have to tell you a little bit of what was funny to me, Kevin, and been in the hospital, we've been getting daily updates, the church was kind of on round o'clock prayers. And so he texts me and says, Hey, Jeremy, I'm down for preaching. Do you think you could get somebody else to preach for me? As if we were going to show up? And like Kevin's down? Where is Kevin? We knew when Kevin was, but he was he was asking me to switch him off. So I said, we've got you covered. Kevin, we are certainly glad to see you and appreciate the many answered prayers. And we do continue to pray for you as well. Okay, let me transition a little bit here. So when I was a kid, one of the cartoons I remember and I don't know if this is universal, I know some of my age will remember this, but there was a goofy character named Inspector Gadget. Anybody heard of that Inspector Gadget and you'd say Go Go gadget, or go go get it as a kid that just seemed amazing to me the fact that you could stretch your arm, you know, all the way across the room. And I'm not sure what I could do with this superpower. I don't know reach a remote without getting a or something like that. But it was amazing to see. Inspector Gadget, add a little catchy song and all of that Inspector Gadget could stretch his arm out and be able to save people and do different things like the well. This year, we are looking at God's pain and thinking about holding God's hand. One of the aspects of God's hand that we see in Scripture is that it is an outstretched hand and outstretched hand. And I think that's extremely powerful. It's a it's a great image. You know, moving past that silly illustration of Inspector Gadget, we see Almighty God who is able to stretch out his hand to save anyone to help anyone. God is not far away. He is in heaven. He is transcendent, in a sense, but his outstretched hand can reach us. And so I'd like for a few moments this morning to think about God's outstretched hand. This is one of the common ways to talk about God's hand when we're thinking about the accidents. In fact, there are many times that that is mentioned one of those is in Psalm 136. And that psalm that repeats the phrase for steadfast love endures forever. And in verse 12, it says,

Jeremy Sweets  03:42
summarize there and he brought Israel out from among the Egyptians, I believe that's verse 11. And verse 12, says, with a strong hand and an outstretched arm, God in the accidents, exhibited this mighty hand in this outstretched arm and who could avoid it? Who could miss it? God has a mighty hand. So as we seek to hold God's hand this year, and I think that's a great thing for us. I'd like to point out just a few things about God's outstretched hand. God's outstretched and one of the things we see about this outstretched hand is that is really an extension of his character. It tells us everything about who he is. And so I'd like to notice a few things about God's character as we consider his outstretched hand this morning. First of all, it shows us his dominion and authority, his dominion and authority. As God stretches out his hands he reveals that he is powerful, and that He has authority over all things. In Isaiah 48 In verse 13, his dominion and authority are clearly established and have been from the beginning When he created all thing, there it says, My hand laid the foundation of the earth. And my right hand spread out the heavens. When I called them they stand forth together, God stretched out his hand to create the world. And that shows us his power, his might. He is sovereign overall, because He created all, not only to God create all things, but his outstretched hand also continues to direct the affairs of the world. There is no place in the world that is beyond his reach. There is no nation in the world that is beyond his reach. In Isaiah 14 In verse 26, or excuse me, yeah, that's the right passage, Isaiah 14, verse 26. There in 14, Isaiah 14, we see many Oracle's against other nations. One of those is against a Syria which God states that he will break that nation, at the time of Syria was a great world power, it was inconceivable for many people that that empire would fall. But God says that He would break them. And notice what he says in verse 26. This is the purpose that is purpose concerning the whole earth. And this is the hand that is stretched out over all the nations, for the Lord of posts has purposed and who will know it, his hand is stretched out, and who will turn it back? What an amazing picture. Our God does not just stretch this handout over the nation of Israel. It's not just the God of a single country or nation. God is the God of all the world. And here it says that he stretches his hand out over the nation.

Jeremy Sweets  06:57
God rules, God reigns and his outstretched hand shows us that he is a mighty God. God directs the affairs of nations of the earth by his outstretched hand, no nation is beyond his reach. So we see his dominion and authority. We also see His power and His might, his power and his minds. We began by looking at that phrase from Psalm 136. But that is a phrase that is repeated several times when it talks about God and the Exodus, at least seven other times, it's mentioned in Exodus and Deuteronomy is that that account reflects back upon the accidents, it is with God's outstretched arm, and his mighty or a strong hand, at least 16 other times refers simply to his strong hand. Once again, we find an empire that was overall the earth that was the greatest at the time, and Egypt had great power, a great army, but could they escape God's outstretched arm? Clearly, they could not. One of those instances is found in Deuteronomy four in verse 34. On the book of Deuteronomy, there, we find Moses speaking to the Israelites, and one of the pieces of focus there is the 10 commandments, and that's given in Deuteronomy, chapter five. The whole book is one that emphasizes those first two commandments, there is no god other than God shall have no other God, and you shall not make an item. And that would have been a temptation as they were preparing to enter in to Canaan. And so Moses emphasizes the fact there is only one God, and you should have no other, no other items. And so in Deuteronomy four in verse 34, Moses makes this point or has any God ever attempted to go and take a nation for himself from the midst of another nation, by trials by signs, by wonders, and by war, by a mighty hand, and an outstretched on, and by great deeds of terror, all of which the Lord your God did for you in Egypt before your eyes, you see the point that Moses is making, you have seen and witnessed what God has done with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm, and no other God has done that? What other nation polytheistic nations could say, My God has done? None of them could say that or claim that. But the Israelites could point to what their God had done. And yes, God demonstrated that he is the God of gods King of kings, and He rules over all over all. And the New Testament we see the might of God's hand and First Peter five and verse six, and it reminds us really have our frailty. Humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, so that at the proper time, he may exalt you, Casting all your anxieties on Him because He cares for you. First Peter five, verses six, and seven, when we consider the might have God's saying, we realize the weakness of our own. And there's nothing left for us to do but to humble ourselves. And to recognize is great. Yes, when God stretches out his hand, he demonstrates his power and his mind. When God stretches out his hand, he also reveals His justice and his holiness. You know, sometimes we talk about in this country, the long owner of the law, and that is that criminals are not always able to hide from law enforcement. Now, sometimes they do. But that idea is that the law will reach out and be able to grab you. But when God stretches out his hand, there are none that can escape. God's hand is one that is long and powerful and mighty, and he reaches out against those that are disobedient, those that disrespect him, those that act faithful faithless Lee, and Exodus 14 And verse 13. There it says, when a land sins against me by acting faithless Lee, and I stretch out my hand against. I'm going to summarize the rest of that passage, he says, Only the righteous can escape.

Jeremy Sweets  11:39
So if a nation is wicked before God and He stretches out his hand, the wicked will not be able to escape him. God has great power, and mines in Isaiah 23, in verse 11, it says that he has stretched out his hand over the sea, he has shaken the kingdom. The Lord has given command concerning Canaan to destroy its stronghold. When God stretches out his hand, he often does that in judgments against the nations. And notice he says, he shakes the nations, nations feel like they are so strong, so mighty, so secure, but in God's hand, they are none of those things. God is powerful, and mighty, and he can shake the the kingdoms like they're a paradise. They are nothing in his sight. In Jeremiah 15, verse six, it says, you have rejected me, so I have stretched out my hand against you and destroy you. I am weary of relenting. And God stretches out his hand in judgment, none can escape it, no one can hide, there's no place to go. Because of his outstretched arm and His mighty hand. God has a holy God and he executes justice with his pain. We also see God's grace and his mercy. God's grace and his mercy. When he out stretches, his hand stretches out his hand, we see His grace and mercy. And he does this often in times of trouble and times of difficult and he reaches out and grace and mercy to those that need his help. In Psalm 138, and verse seven, they're the psalmist cries out and says, Though I walk in the midst of trouble, you preserve my law, you stretch out your hand against the wrath of my enemies, and your right hand delivers me. Just as God's hand reaches out against the wicked and judgment at time. He will also reach out his hand to secure and to help and to deliver the righteous. We see God's God's mercy and His grace as he extends to those that will call upon Him. In Psalm 144, in verse seven, it says, Stretch out your hand from on Hi, rescue me and deliver me from the many waters from the hand of Oren. As God reaches out and extends his hands, he's able to pick up those that are in the to drag them to safety to pick them up. I don't know if you've ever seen an action movie, any action. almost without fail, you'll see somebody falling off a cliff and there they are reaching out for someone to save to someone to help them. Almighty God can reach out and none fall in his grass. He has an outstretched arm and a mighty hand. We see this aspect of God also in Jesus Christ. When Peter was when Peter witnessed Jesus walking on the water and we see that in Mark chapter 14, he wanted to get out of the boat and walk on the water as well. And when he did that, when he had his eyes fixed on Jesus, he appeared to be walking. But when he noticed the waves and the storm the waters around him, it says that he began the sink, or study, one says that Jesus immediately reached out his hand and took hold of him. He rescued Peter. And he brought him to safety. Yes, we see God's character by his outstretched hand, and one of the aspects of his character we see is his grace, and His mercy.

Jeremy Sweets  15:40
We also see God's compassion and love. And again, I'll point to Jesus Christ. In March chapter one, we see a leper that came to Jesus and he asked this simple question, if you will, you can make me clean. And I should say he gave this request, if you will, you can make me clean. This was early in Jesus ministry in Mark chapter one. But this man believes that Jesus can heal him, if you will. Leprosy was normally a disease of isolation. It was a disease of loneliness, lepers had to leave the community and live outside the camp. If they see seeing someone coming that was not a leper, they'd have to cover themselves up and declare Unclean, unclean. I'm not sure what that does to the psychology of somebody that has to announce continually, Unclean, unclean. But Jesus did not run and hide from this leper. In fact, we see that he, it says in Mark 141, that he was moved with pity or compassion. And he stretched out his hand and touched him and said to him, I will be clean. I don't think we should overlook the way that Jesus healed this or leper. He didn't do it from a distance. He didn't simply say sand over there, and I'll make you clean. But it says that he reached out and he touched them. This untouchable man, Jesus reached out and touched. And he did that because of his love, and His compassion. What a fantastic lesson that is for us as we seek to emulate the character of Christ. Often we simply need to reach out to people. Sometimes they need the the loving touch that we can provide. Jesus reached out because of his compassion and his love, and he healed this level. We see this with Jesus. Also, when it comes to children. The children were rebuked, because they were interfering with this busy and important man, Jesus Christ, His disciples were serving as bodyguards almost. They're trying to keep away things that were unimportant. But Jesus did not see the children as unimportant. He says, Let them come to me. Let the children come to Me and do not hinder them for to such belongs the kingdom of God. And that's in Mark 10, in verse 14, then he stretched out his hands, and he took them in his arms, and he bless them. Jesus Christ stretched out his hands and welcome the children with great love, and compassion. And so we see the character of God as seen in Jesus Christ. But the greatest demonstration of God's character is when Jesus Christ stretched out his hands on the cross. As he lifted both of his hands up and he was nailed on the cross, he did so for you. And for me, he died on the cross for our sins, and that clearly demonstrates God's great love and His compassion. Before we've seen God's power and his mind that none would resist them. But here we see Jesus Christ willingly going to the cross stretching out his hands. And it actually was a distinct display of power of the resolve of his character. But many people that time saw what had happened as a sign of his weakness. Here is God this one claims to be God stretching out his hands and where is his power now? A few days later, they would see his powers he was raised from the dead by the power of God. But what was seen as weakness, when Jesus stretched out his hand, was a display of his mighty power. And Luke 24, when Jesus would come to His disciples, He would show them his hands, says, see my hands and my feet, his hands would have been scarred. Now this would have been after the resurrection after he had died. And when he came back to his disciples, see my hands and my feet Luke 24 And verse 39. The disciples that says, responded with disbelief for joy they were marveling. I imagine we would do the same thing. Just unbelievable. But marveling at what we'd seen

Jeremy Sweets  20:23
God's characters displayed most clearly on the cross when He died for you. And for me, if I were to summarize all these items, one of the things I see is that God is near God is near. And that's true when we're in trouble. That's true when we act wickedly, and he brings judgment. That's true when other nations rise up against him. That's true when we are in need of him or his grace and mercy, compassion and love. God is near God is near. And Acts chapter two and verse 38, when when Peter preached that first sermon on Pentecost, and the people responded to the Gospel message by saying, What shall we do? They were pierced in their heart at the preaching of Jesus Christ. And they asked, What shall we do? Peter said, Repent and let each one of you be baptized for the gift of the Holy Spirit. And in verse 39, it says this, For the promises for you and for all your children, and for all who are a far off. Here the gospel was being preached to the Jews first, but it was not only intended for the Jews, it was not to be restricted to the Jew. But it was for all who are far off, and that would include the Gentiles, as well. But I love that language, because it tells me something about who God is. There is no one outside of his reach. Sometimes I feel like we think we are outside of his reach, or why hasn't God helped me in my struggles, and my pain, where is God now, but we need to know and understand that God loves us and cares for us, and we are not outside of his reach. He does not magically take all problems away from us. Sometimes we have to endure those difficulties. And we grow in our trust and our reliance upon him. But God is not far from any of us. And that's true when it comes to salvation there in Acts chapter two. And it's true in all aspects of our life. And acts 17, as, as Paul went to Athens, and he saw the idolatry that was around in the polytheism, as they worshipped many gods, there was a statue there an altar to the unknown God, just in case they had missed one, just in case they hadn't seen more. And Paul uses that as an opportunity to point them to the God they did not know the true God and heaven. And he says of this God in verse 27, and he made from one man, every nation of mankind to live on all the face of the earth, having determined a lot of periods and the boundaries of their dwelling place, that they should seek God, and perhaps feel their way or grope toward him and find him. Yet he actually is not far from each one of us. God can be found, we simply must seek after him, and, and follow after Him. He is not far from each one of us. And we see that in God's outstretched hand. God's outstretched, well, what should our response be? To this mighty God? Well, when we see God's dominion, and his authority, we should acknowledge Him as the great and mighty God. In Hebrews 13, in verse 15, it says, Through Him, Jesus Christ, then let us continually offer up a sacrifice of praise to God. That is the fruit of lifts that acknowledge his name. When we see God's power and his mind, we need to be a people that acknowledge Him that acknowledge his greatness. Often we're quick to acknowledge our greatness, or some great thing we saw on a sports team what we think is great. But let us be quick to acknowledge the greatness and the mind and the power of God. He has all dominion and authority and he deserves nothing less. Let us turn to him. His outstretched hand reveals His power and His might, we have access to the most powerful being in the universe. So let us turn to him in times of need. But as turned to him when we face troubles, let us turn to him when we When we have blessings turned to him and thank him and realize the good things that he has done. And Isaiah 45 And verse 22, there, God says, turned to me and be saved. All the ends of the earth, for I am God and there is no other.

Jeremy Sweets  25:22
I'm reminded that many people turn to many things. But God says, I'm the only God. If you seek to be saved, to be rescued, then turn to Me, turn to me. And First Thessalonians one and verse nine, it there talks about the Thessalonians, that they had had a good rapport among those that were around them, for they had turned to God from idols to serve the living in true God. They had turned to God away from idolatry. And we need to do the same thing turn to God away from all sin and all rivals to Him. God's outstretched hand reveals His justice and holiness. And in light of that we need to fear him, respect his power and mine, we need to understand that God will execute justice. We shouldn't challenge him on that, or doubt him in any way. Psalm 33, in verse eight, it says, Let all the earth fear of the Lord, let all the inhabitants of the world stand in awe of him. Let us fear God, in light of his outstretched hand. We also need to find him when we consider his outstretched hand, and then it reveals His grace and mercy. Our response to that cannot be one where we try to earn what He has given no that was given out of grace, and mercy for us. We can't earn anything there. There's, it's not a transaction. Well, God did this for me, I'll simply do this. And then we're even. That's not how that works. Instead, though, we can thank him, and appreciate the good things that he has done for us. And that should be constantly on our hearts. Psalm 107, in verse one, oh, give thanks to the Lord, for He is good, or steadfast love and yours forever. Thank him for his character and the things that he has done for us. In Psalm 100 And verse four, Enter his gates with thanksgiving and his courts with praise, give thanks to Him, bless his name for the Lord is good, His steadfast love and yours forever and his faithfulness to all generation. Let's be thankful people and recognize God and thank him continually. When we see God's love and compassion, our response is to serve Him. And again, to remind you of the last point, this is not an exchange, he does something for us, we do something for him, and then we call it even now we serve him out of love and appreciation to him. In Deuteronomy, chapter 11, in verse 13, as Moses proclaims the Israelites learn need to follow after God. There he says, and if you will, indeed obey my commandments that I command you today, to love the Lord your God, and to serve Him with all your heart and with all your soul. And he goes on to say, and I paraphrase, then He will bless you, then He will bless you. So let us love and serve God. That is the appropriate response to our mighty and awesome God. That's the lesson this morning. We have an emanation that's that's extended from God's outstretched arm as well. You can't you don't have to fall through the cracks. When it comes to God. You don't have to worry about God's power, his ability to save even you and even me, God can and will save those that are willing. If you're not a Christian, you have an opportunity to obey the gospel message, believing that Jesus is the Christ, repenting of your sins, confessing Jesus as the Christ and being baptized in the water for forgiveness of your sins. That whole process is a submission of the will and an acknowledgement of God's greatness and His mind. If you're here this morning and you are a Christian, you need to understand that you've made a lifelong commitment. So if you are giving up on that commitment or not living as you should you also need to make correction today. There's any that are subject to the invitation, please come as we stand in sync at this time.
