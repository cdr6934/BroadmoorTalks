First Timothy chapter four.

Conrad Harkrider  00:25
In the New Testament, one of the most significant and prominent figures that we read about is the apostle Paul. He wrote 13 of the 27 books. In the New Testament, we can read about his travels and his missionary journeys in the book of Acts, we can see the impact that his life and his ministry had on the early church. He was one of the most well known apostles because of the work that he did. But although we know about his conversion, and how he came to the Lord, we are not given very much information about his family. He says that he was a Pharisee, the son of a Pharisee. And first Corinthians chapter seven, he mentions being single, we not sure if he was married, before that, or sometime after, and we're not told about any children. But in Christ, Paul was a spiritual father to many. And in First Timothy chapter one and verse two, when he's writing to this young preacher, he says to Timothy, my true son, in the faith, Paul was like a spiritual father, to Timothy, it was one of the closest relationships that he had. And so in First and Second Timothy, we we see a very personal letter that's being sent to this young man, Paul is trying to encourage him, to help Him to strengthen Him to navigate a very difficult situation that Timothy finds himself in. Imagine if you were writing something to one of your children who was living in a far off place, and you had limited time and space and opportunity to tell them some important reminders, what would you say? What would be the emphasis of your words? What point would you try to make as clear as possible, so as to help them in the best possible way. When Paul writes to his son in the faith, Timothy, he emphasizes this idea of holding to the truth, holding to the truth. That's what I'd like for us to think about this morning. First Timothy, chapter four, begin reading with me in verse six. It says, If you instruct the brethren in these things, you will be a good minister of Jesus Christ, nourished in the words of faith and of the good doctrine which you have carefully followed, but rejects profane and old wives' fables, and exercise yourself towards godliness, for bodily exercise profits a little, but godliness is profitable for all things, having promise of the life that now is, and of that which is to come. This is a faithful saying, and worthy of all acceptance. For to this end, we both labor and suffer reproach, because we trust in the living God, who is the Savior of all men, especially those who believe these things command and teach. Let no one despise your youth, but be an example to the believers in Word and conduct, in love, in spirit in faith, in purity, till I come, give attention to reading, to exhortation, to doctrine, do not neglect the gift that is in you, which was given to you by the prophecy with the laying on of the hands of the eldership meditate on these things. Give yourself entirely to them, that your progress may be evident to all. Take heed to yourself, and to the doctrine, continue in them. For in doing this, you will save both yourself and those who hear you.

That section that we just read, you might have noticed that the word truth is not actually mentioned. But this idea and this principle of truth is found throughout the section in these verses, and I'll For us to focus on five points this morning that emphasize truth from this section first of all, notice that truth is real. Truth is real, although the word is not used in these verses, it's the word truth is found six times. And the letter of First Timothy, one of those is in chapter four and verse three. He says in chapter four, verse three forbidding to marry and commanding to abstain from foods which God created, to be received with thanksgiving by those who believe and know the truth. So truth is something that we can know and understand. Paul says that there was those who were going there were those who were going around, and they were teaching that you should abstain from these various blessings, not to marry not to eat certain types of food. And Paul says that those things should be received with thanksgiving, by those who believe and know the truth. In First Timothy chapter two and verse four, it says, that God desires all people to be saved, and, and to come to a knowledge of the truth. So truth is something that we learn that we come to understand and acknowledge truth is a standard. Truth is statements of actuality, to accept truth is to receive what has been verified things that conform to fact, simply put, truth is the way things really are. We understand truth in the physical world, if you take a ball and you drop it, it will fall to the ground. That's a statement of truth, because of the laws of gravity, the sun, gives heat to our world. And we understand that because of our observation, and our experience, we have come to accept those things as true. But what about truth as it relates to morality in the spiritual realm? This is an area that has become more controversial, the idea of relativism, that what's true for you is not necessarily not necessarily true for me. And then the idea that truth is not absolute. That truth depends on culture depends on society, it depends on which decade you were born in. But the Bible speaks of truth as something that is real, something that can be known and understood and ultimately false. It's not an abstract concept. It's not just a philosophical idea, but it is words that have been given from the source of truth from God Himself. Think about it, if we believe that God created the universe, isn't he in a position to tell us how things should operate, how things should work, how we should live our lives, God's word, and truth are synonymous, they are the same thing. And you see this in First Timothy, chapter four of this, why Paul is putting so much emphasis on the teaching, the doctrine, on these words, these things that are true because they can be relied on they can be counted on. Look at First Timothy chapter four and verse six. He says, If you instruct the brethren in these things, you will be a good minister of Jesus Christ, nourished in the words of faith, and of the good doctrine which you have carefully followed. Timothy is to be trained, he is to be nourished upon the words of faith, and the good doctrine. Look also at verse nine. It says, this is a faithful saying and worthy of all acceptance. This is faithful, it is trustworthy, it deserves full acceptance. These are things that we can count on that we can rely on, because they are true. Imagine if you were hiking in the Smoky Mountains, and you didn't have any water with you and you came, you were starting to get thirsty and you came up upon a bubbling spring, coming out of a rock. And next to the spring, there was a little sign that someone had made, and it said, This water is safe for drinking, what would you do? Would you immediately get down and start gulping that up? Well, you might hesitate and wonder Who put that sign there? Who made that? Was it a group of teenagers? Or was it someone who knows the area who's tested the water Who is sure that it is safe and ready for drinking? When we come to God's word, Paul as Paul reassures Timothy, these are words that have not been tampered, or polluted in some way. But instead, they are trustworthy. They are pure, they are life giving words which can provide spiritual wisdom and knowledge, truth is real. We also see from this passage that truth must be taught. In verse six, he says, instruct the brethren, put these things before the brothers. In verse 11. He says, To command and teach these things, this is such a vital part of our growth and our development. As Christians, we have to be learned, we have to be taught, we have to learn these things. It's one of the reasons why we spend such a good portion of our time, our collective time together, reading, studying, focusing on God's Word, we could choose to spend our time in a lot of different ways. There's other things that we could do, we could make food for the community, we could go around doing various service projects, we could focus on the kids play games, play sports, try to get them active. But instead, a lot of our so much of our time is spent focusing on an understanding God's word. Look at what he says in verse 13.

Conrad Harkrider  11:38
In verse 13, till I come give attention to reading, to exhortation, to doctrine, reading the scripture out loud. That was something that was a common practice in the synagogue. Among the Jews. You remember, in Luke chapter four, and verse 13, Jesus got up to read in Nazareth in the synagogue, and they handed him the scroll. And the place that he went and found was from Isaiah 61. It was a prophecy that was about him, and he got up and read it. In front of those who were there, the Spirit of the Lord is upon me to preach the Good News to the poor. So when Paul tells Timothy to read the Scripture, this is not something new that that the Jewish Christians had never heard of. But why do they need to keep doing this? Why is this an important aspect of their worship? Well, for one thing, not everyone has their own copy of the scriptures. The Bible was not available on their phone. They didn't have their own parchments and scrolls that they could take home and read. And so the scriptures were very limited and rare. Well, why not just have Timothy read the Scripture? Why not him, just study it, and then inform everyone what it says, because there is an emphasis on personal knowledge and understanding. The Lord wants you. He wants me he wants all of us to understand and know His will, so that we can live that out in our everyday lives. Remember that those who follow Jesus were called disciples. A disciple was someone who learned, they see they sought to practice and follow the instructions of their teachers. And so teaching and learning are critical parts, if we are going to be disciples, followers of Christ. Have you ever known somebody who could fix anything, whether it was in the garage with the car or around the house, if a washing machine broke or something in the bathroom, it seems like they could always get their hands on it and get it working again. Maybe that was dad or grandpa or someone in your in your family. But what happens when that person is no longer around? What happens if they're not at the house when something breaks? Now all of a sudden, the water is pouring on to the floor. We're not sure where the shutoff valve is maybe because we've never been shown or taught. And the parallel is the Lord doesn't want just a few select people in the body of Christ, to have all of the knowledge, the wisdom, the instruction, but rather, this is something that all of us should be striving to grow to maturity. In Second Timothy chapter two and verse two, he says, and what you have heard from me in the presence of many witnesses, entrust to faithful men who will be able to teach others also. You see what's happening there. Paul is sharing his knowledge with Timothy He doesn't want Timothy just to hold that to himself. He says find other faithful men, that you can pass that to, that you can entrust them with that message. And then it is a chain reaction, they would be able that those men would then be able to share it with others as well. We'll notice how Timothy is about to go is how he's to go about his teaching in verse 13. For some of the 413 It says, till I come give attention to reading, to exhortation, to doctrine, exhortation, that's not a word that we use a lot in our everyday language and speaking, but it means to urge someone to do something, to encourage them to stir them into action. You remember Barnabas, who was the son of encouragement, and he was often sent to churches and to cities in places where his job his role was to exhort them to admonish and encourage them to remain faithful to keep going. And so it is that teaching is more than just learning information, learning facts, and knowledge. But rather, it is to motivate and stir us up so that we can progress and move forward. Which brings us to our next point, which is that truth must be lived. Truth must be live. Look at verse 12. First Timothy four, verse 12, it says, Let no one despise your youth, but be an example to the believers in word, in conduct, in love in spirits, in faith, in purity. It wasn't just about the things that Paul was telling Timothy and that he was learning these things. It wasn't just about Timothy then sharing those with the congregation. But Paul says he was to be an example, in his conduct in regards to purity. Timothy not only needed to preach the truth, but that truth needed to be manifested in the way that he lived his life. It didn't make sense for Timothy to be telling the brothers and sisters to abstain from sexual immorality, but then for himself to be involved in all kinds of sexual sin. All says he needed to be an example. Notice verse six, in verse six, it says that Timothy was to be nourished and trained in the word of faith. This was the doctrine that he had followed. He was to be nourished upon these words. What does that mean when we are nourished when we are strengthened from the food that we eat? When you think about what would be the point of eating something that provided no nutritional value, no calories, it gave you no carbohydrates or energy, it'd be like swallowing air into your stomach. That doesn't produce anything inside of us. It doesn't have an effect. And so it is with God's word. When we take that into our hearts, and to our minds, it should create within us some type of response. Look at verse seven, this idea of truth being lived, he says, to exercise yourself towards godliness, exercise, there's action here, it's not just knowing or thinking something in your head, but it should change the way that we live. In verse eight, he says that bodily training or exercise is of some value. This bodily training is most likely referring to some type of physical restriction. Refraining from doing something not bodily exercise, like we think of lifting weights, but this would have been like asceticism, choosing not to eat something or partake in something. And Paul says that holding your body under control like that, there is some value to restrict yourself in those ways. But notice that the greater blessing and benefit comes from godliness from walking and living in a way that is consistent with all that God has revealed. That has value not just in this life, but also In the life to come, it has value in every way. In Matthew chapter seven, in verse 20, it says, Thus you will recognize them by their fruits. Not everyone who says to Me, Lord, Lord will enter the kingdom of heaven, but the one who does the will of my Father, Who is in heaven. Jesus says that it's not just about calling out upon God's name. It's not just about even coming to a worship service going to church. But Jesus says that the one who will be blessed are those who do the will of their father. He says, By their fruits, you will recognize them, you know, an apple tree, if

Conrad Harkrider  20:45
it produces apples, you know, a pear tree if it is making pears. And so in the same way God's children will be known if they are walking in his ways, and bearing fruit, living the truth. Living in truth means that our actions are consistent with our words. When I was younger, my parents had this rule around the house that I just didn't like. It was that we weren't allowed to take food into the living area, and eat over the carpet. Now, my parents, I understand why they had that they were trying to keep the house clean and managing small kids. And so they just made this blanket rule, no food in the den, over the carpet. One night, after I went to bed, I got up to get a drink of water. From the kitchen, my parents were still awake. They were in the living room, I looked inside, and to see what they were doing, they were watching a movie, and eating food over the carpet. And I thought to myself, that's what they do. When we go to bed. They break all the rules. Of course, now I realized if it's your house and your carpet, then you can do whatever you want. But when it comes to God's word, there should be consistency in the things that we say to other people, and the things that we tell our children, and the things that we profess, around co workers or neighbors or friends. If we say that it's wrong to murder someone else, that that would be a horrible thing to do. Then we shouldn't turn around and speak evil or tear down someone else. If we say that we should not love money, we should be free from the love of money, then all of our energy and focus and time shouldn't be spent on trying to acquire more wealth. If we say that it's important to love your neighbor as yourself, and that should be manifested in treating people with kindness, dignity, and respect. Those things are not easy, but God calls us to live and walk as people of truth. Also notice that truth is something that must be pursued. In verse 15, Timothy, Paul writes to Timothy, meditate on these things, give yourself entirely to them that your progress may be evident to all. He says, To meditate, to practice these things to immerse yourself in them. Truth is such a vital component of our faith. That is something that we should totally cover ourselves in, we should immerse ourselves. In truth, this word meditate in the New King James, is also translated as practice in the ESV. And in the classical Greek that that word was used to describe someone who was learning some type of art, or some new skill, like how to shoot a bow. If you think about learning to play an instrument, when you first start out, you have no idea what to do, you don't know where to put your hands. You don't know what all the keys mean, you don't know how to play a chord you don't know rhythm and tempo and all of those things. So how do you become proficient? How do you learn to play that instrument? Well, if you want to pick it up and be able to play well, you have to practice on a daily basis. Walking in truth is something that we have to continually strive and work at. Look at verse 16. He says, Take heed to yourself into the doctrine, continue in them, continue in them persist, keep at it. It's not something that we try for just a little while and then we've got it. This is something that is a lifelong journey, and growing and continuing To progress in our faith in the parable of the sower, Jesus spoke of the seed that fell among the rocky places. And initially, that seed sprung up, there was enough soil there that it was able to produce some type of plant. But Jesus says that, after a time, after a short time the sun came up, there was trouble or persecution, and the plants began to wither away. They weren't able to sustain themselves because they had no root.

Conrad Harkrider  25:36
understanding and accepting the truth is not just something that happens at one point, but rather it should be a continual, lifelong journey, to continue to pursue God's Word, God's truth. That's why we talk about endurance that the Christian life is not a sprint, but rather it's a long race. It's like a marathon. We have to keep going, keep learning, and grow and progress in our faith. One of the things that stood out to us when we first came to Broadmoor long time ago, was, there was so many different types of people that were a part of the congregation at the time. We were a young couple we had been married about a year. But when we got here, at least with children, there were empty nesters. There were people who were retired who had lost a spouse who were like we could see or thinking about, well, what is life? Look, we can look around and see a family who is still serving the Lord, what is your life look like? There's a way we can look at those who here who are here if there's something that we can do to support you or help you in your walk with Christ. If you need to obey the gospel and accept the truth of God's word, then this is a perfect opportunity. There's something we can do to help you please come down to the front as we stand and sing
