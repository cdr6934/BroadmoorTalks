I can't think of a better way to start the first Sunday in 2021, than with shouting praises to God to come him in prayers, just a wonderful opportunity that we have to come and assemble to worship our God appreciate that prayer, David, as we seek to be lights, and be salt in a dark world and pray for our nation. Appreciate Isaac, you weren't at the Lord's table, reminding us of what Jesus went through on our behalf and our need to remember him every day of our lives, appreciate those songs killed that you've led, it'll go along with the lesson that I had prepared for us this morning, when in my previous Bible reading program that just finished up looking at several Psalms. And so in doing so is reminded me of some powerful lessons that God is trying to teach to us. And so this morning, I wanted to look at Psalm 146. And with a suggestion that it sets forth the idea of how we can live in happiness and in hope. And I want to suggest to us this morning, that this psalm, if you think about the meaning of it, and the purpose of it, it really does tell us how to live excuse me, and happiness or blessedness. And, and hope. And I think if there's one thing that everyone is looking for in the new year, is hope, hope for better tomorrow, hope for better governmental relations, hope for more success in spreading the gospel. But hope is at the heart of who we are. And this, this psalm basically tells us how to live in happiness, or blessedness. And hope I use those words somewhat interchangeably, because happiness, in some ways, depends upon happenings or circumstances. So you can't always be happy when you get a really bad toothache, you're not going to be happy. But you can always be blessed. And always be thankful. And so that's a word that maybe conveys the meaning of this a little bit better. But as we think about this title, and so often in my preaching, I want to bring a message that's practical, and the title gets your attention. So how to live in happiness, or how to live in blessedness. And hope if I wrote a book with that title, and I published it to through Amazon or Barnes and Noble, I don't know how you self publish these days. But if I did that, and put a booklet out, and get that in mass circulation, how to live in happiness, and hope I'd probably make a million dollars,

Mike Roy  02:46
or maybe half a million dollars a lot, because it's a powerful thought to think about how to live in happiness in and hope. Yet this is the clear message of God's Word. He tells us how to live a blessed life, a happy life, a fulfilled life, and how to live in hope. And it's the clear message of Psalm 146. And it's free. You don't have to buy Amazon anyplace else. It's free to the reading. Yet, so few people in our culture read the Bible, which provides us the greatest help and hope that God offers. And I think sometimes too many of us Christians don't read God's word like we should on a regular basis. Fortunately here Broadmoor, I am confident that many families, many Christians are reading God's Word on a regular basis. And as we come into the 21, we urge you to continue your daily reading of God's word. This is manna from heaven. You need strength via trials and hope for the future. This is God's Word gives that to us. And so you've just finished up your reading program for last year, we hope that you'll embark on another program. If you haven't chosen a plan yet, Norm just sent out an email in the group me message. That there are several plans available, we urge you to read God's word on a regular basis. This is food that will sustain your soul through all the trust trials that we can come across in this live. So let's go look at Psalm chapter 146. If you have your Bible, you can leave that open, I'm gonna have this up on the screen. But as I was thinking about this particular song, the message that communicates to us, God is telling us how we can live a blessed life, in spite of every difficulty that we're facing, and how we can live in hope. That's really one of the messages in Scripture. We need hope for tomorrow, and hope for the future. So there are five points that I've put together for this lesson. And the first point is we answer the question how do we live in happiness? How do we live a blessed life and live in hope? We'll begin by praising the Lord with all of your being. And as long as you have breath, that's what we see in verse one had appreciated Those songs that Gil led for us. So that the text begins this way that Kevin read for us praise the Lord. In fact, the Psalms, Psalm 146, through 150, or sometimes a thing called the halau. Songs, every song begins and ends with the same phrase, praise the Lord or hallelujah. So as praise the Lord, let all that I am praise the Lord, I will praise the Lord as long as I live, I will sing praises to my god with my dying breath is the New Living Translation. So one of the ways that we live in hope, and live a blessed life, a truly happy life, not just circumstantially, but inwardly, being blessed by God is we praise God, with every fiber of our being. And that's, I think, what this translation is saying, The New Century Version and puts it this way, praise the Lord, my whole being, my whole being, praise the Lord,

Mike Roy  06:03
I will praise the Lord all my life, I will sing praises to my God as long as I live. And so this is really the essence of life in a lot of ways we were created to praise God, to shout his praises, to sing his praises, to live out his praises, we were created to worship Him, not just congregationally as we're doing this morning, but our lives should be a reflection of worship, and our daily activities. And so the first and perhaps the most important thing that we can do every day that we live, not just when we come together, and we're still in kind of limited assemblies, because of this COVID protocol, and all of that, but we give praise to God, and we praise him with every fiber of our being with all the strength that is within us. We give that to God. And so this is one of the ways that we live in hope. We continue praising Him, in spite of the difficulties in spite of loneliness, despite of hardships in spite of setbacks, or trials or temptations, we praise God with all of our strength. And as long as we have breath, that's my hope and pray that, that I will praise God until I breathed my last breath, and then by His grace being transferred through eternal glory, along with you. So this message is very clear in Psalm 146. If you look at a kind of a New Testament equivalent, in Mark chapter 12, verses 2030, again, a passage familiar to most of us, says that one of the scribes came up and heard them disputing with one another and seeing that he answered them well asked him, which commandment is the most important of all, so these scribe describes asking Jesus, what's the most important command? Number one, what's number one command and all the Scripture, Jesus answered, the most important is Hear, O Israel, the LORD our God, the Lord is one, and you shall love the Lord your God. You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and with all your mind, and with all your strength, I'm not sure if I can really understand the magnitude of that verse, the significance of that, if I love God with all of my heart, that's every aspect of my cognitive skills, my ability to express myself the emotions that run through there, if I love God with all of my heart, and then with all of my soul, that's another spiritual dimension, talking about the how complete and total is our love for God. And then, to love God with all of my mind isn't it's kind of some repetition, in some ways here. them to love God with all of my thinking capacity, I need to be thinking about him and not about me, or trials or temptations are things that we all wrestle with. And then he says, to love God with all of your strength. What's God saying to us? What's Jesus saying to us? The most important thing in life is for me to give God my everything, every ounce of strength is possible to give him in my heart, my mind, my soul, my body, everything goes to God. I give that to God. And so Mark chapter 12, is an echo in some ways of what we're reading in Psalm, chapter 146. And I stressed this and you look at these commands, and the the instructions here on the screen. We understand that this is no small task. God isn't just interested as being religious. Or people say, I went to church today, or I read my Bible, I could check that off my list. That's not what God's looking forward. He's looking for us to give him all of our hearts mind, soul and strength. And again, this is this is the command God commands that we love him to In this way, so again, in terms of going back to Psalm 146, is telling us that we we praise God, and give him the praises. And the honor that is due Him. That helps us to keep our minds focused on him, and also increases our hope in Him. And Romans chapter 12, maybe to go along the same line, or maybe a little bit different line. Paul says in verse one, therefore, I urge you, brothers and sisters in view of God's mercy, to offer your bodies as a living sacrifice holy and pleasing to God. This is your true and proper worship. So your true and proper worship is offering your body as a living sacrifice,

Mike Roy  10:50
holy and pleasing to God. And then it goes on to say, Do not conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind, then you will be able to test and prove with what God's will is His good, pleasing and perfect will. So Paul reminds us here in Romans chapter 12, that we offer God true and proper worship, when we present our bodies as a living sacrifice, total devotion to God. And so the first may go back to one more Scripture before we go on to the second point. So the Psalms and with this well known psalm, Psalm 50 150, the end of these, the Hallelujah psalms are the halau songs, praise the Lord, praise God in his sanctuary, praise him in his mighty heavens. Praise Him for His acts of power, praise him for his surpassing greatness. Praise Him to the sounding of the trumpet. Praise him with the harp and lyre, praise him with the timbrel and dancing, praise him with the strings in pipe, praise him with a clash of cymbals Praise him with a resounding cymbals. It's obviously talking about the type of worship that was common in the Old Testament. And then in verse six, he makes the statement, Let everything that has breath, praise the Lord. Praise the Lord, how many times that phrase Praise Lord mentions over and over again. So everything that God created, the sea creatures, everything that he made, gives praise to God. And he certainly wants us to do the same. So if we want to live a blessed life, and a life of hope, and happiness and contentment, that we need to praise the Lord, with all of our hearts, our minds, our soul and our strength. Secondly, as we continue to talk about how do we live in hope? How do we live in happiness, or blessedness? Well, secondly, I think this psalm suggests, don't put your don't put your confidence in political leaders, who will all pass away, look at the text over here. And Psalm 146, verses three and four, this is the NIV says, Do not put your trust in princes, in human beings who cannot say, when their spirit departs, they returned to the ground. On that very day, their plans come to nothing. So he said, Don't put your trust in Kings, and rulers and queens and presidents, they all die. And their plans die. They may have lofty goals, they may have horrible ideas that some dictators have done throughout history. But the psalmist is telling us Do not put your trust, in my numeric and Standard Version says in mere mortals and human beings who do pass away. And why this God gives us give us that instruction not to put our trust in princes, in rulers, and kings, or generals, or presidents is because they're all flawed, they're all human. And they're all going to the grave. And so, again, it's a reminder if we want to live in hope, real hope. It's not gonna be found in some person, the king of a country, the queen of a country, the president of one country, they all rise and they all fall fall they live and then they die. And that's that's the nature of our human existence, when Daniels was given a vision

Mike Roy  14:12
about how God's kingdom would ultimately supersede and overcome all the kingdoms of the world. And verse 20, Daniel answered, and said, blessed to be the name of God forever and ever for his wisdom and might are his any changes the times and the seasons. He removes kings and raises up kings gives wisdom to the wise and knowledge to those who have understanding. One thing to think about when we especially coming through a such a politically charged year, this past year, and I'm not sure how much that's changing, or hopefully it'll change at some point. But we get we get so focused on who we want to be in office, or who we want to be the ruler of this country or the governor of a state. And if our guy wins, we're So excited. And if our guy loses, we're so depressed. But understand one thing that God brings rulers to power, or allows them to come to power for his purposes. And he removes them for his purposes, we remind ourselves God is bigger God is greater. And, and no matter who sits in the White House on the throne of England, God rose from his eternal home in heaven. And so the second lesson is to Psalm teaches us, in terms of how to live in this happiness are blessedness and hope. Just understand that we do not need to put our confidence in human beings. And I think perhaps, for me, maybe for many of us, one of the things that I've learned from this past year politically, is not to get too caught up in who, who's going to win an election, who who's who's not going to win an election, that doesn't really matter. In the end, God rules and, and our hope is not in any human being. Our hope is in our Mighty God in heaven. So that's the second point. The third point that this psalm teaches us is that we need to make the God of Jacob our help and our hope. And in so doing, we will be truly blessed. So that's really what the psalmist is telling us here in these verses, look at verses five and six, says bless it is he whose help is the God of Jacob, whose hope is in the Lord his God, who made heaven and earth, the sea, and all that is in them, who keeps faith forever. So how do we get this blessedness, or this happiness, this blessing, this is on those whose help and whose hope is the God of Jacob. And his isn't the Lord his God, the New Living, translation puts it this way. But joyful are those who have the God of Israel as their helper. And so when the Psalmist tells us that, that we need to put our hope and and our confidence into God of Jacob, Jacob stood for all of Israel. And so it's also a reflection that God is not just the God of one person, he is the God of his people, his covenant people Israel, so the instruction is for us to make the God of Jacob that is the God of all Israel, his covenant people, our God, and my God. And in so doing, we will truly be blessed. And so it's a choice that we make, we choose to make God our Savior, oh Lord, and we put our complete trust in Him when we do that. When we trust God put our hope, and recognize God, the God of Jacob, the God of Israel as our hope, then it gives us a level of confidence that becomes an anchor for the soul. We sing about that this morning. Joyful of those who have the God of Israel as their helper whose hope is that is in the Lord their God. Look at Hebrews chapter six, verses 17, through 20. With me, again, this reminder of the power of hope, that when we put our trust in God, and then the blood of Christ, that we remembered this morning, we have hope, which is an anchor for the soul. In verse 17, in the same way, it says God, desiring even more to show to the heirs of the promised the unchangeable pneus of his purpose interpose with an oath, so that by two unchangeable things in which it is impossible for God to lie, we who have taken refuge and would have strong encouragement to take hold of the hope set before so that's what the Hebrew that's what the rite of Hebrews is encouraging these Christians to do, take hold of the hope that is set before us as a choice. He said, this hope we have is an anchor of the soul. And so it's a reminder that when we have our hope, and God, the God of Jacob, the God of Israel, the God of all of creation, then that hope, then our souls are tethered

Mike Roy  19:15
to to God and no matter what storms and trials assail us, we can overcome them. So he said that this hope we have as an anchor of the soul, a hope both sure and steadfast in one which enters within the veil. So what what we gain when we put our trusting in God and the God of Jacob, the God of is that we have a hope that cannot be diminished or destroyed in any way. It becomes like an anchor for our souls is something that sure that steadfast it enters within the veil, where Jesus has entered as a forerunner for so it's reminds us that what we have through Jesus Christ is that he was not just like the high priest he went to you went To the Holy of Holies, he went into the very presence of God on your behalf. And on our behalf. It gives us an incredible sense of hope and assurance that whatever happens and challenges that we face, are not going to diminish our hope. And so, again, it's a choice we make, the God of Jacob, our help and our hope. And in so doing, we become truly blessed. And that's what this text is saying, how blessing is he whose help is the God of Jacob whose hope is in the Lord his God, who made heaven and earth to see and all that is in them? Why does it say about putting our hope in God, not just that he's the God of Israel, of God of Jacob. But he's the God who made heaven and earth, the sea and all that is in the why does it reveal to us to Goddess identify this way, because, as the creator of heaven and earth, he has endless power and strength to help us and to strengthen us? Are you facing difficulties in your life, sometimes it could be loneliness, could be sickness, it could be bereavement, it could be any number of things that all of us struggle with, and wrestle with, to some degree. But we put our hope in the God of heaven and earth, there's nothing too difficult for him, have to believe that there's nothing too difficult for God, in your life, or in my life, or in all of our lives, collectively. He is a God who is so big, so powerful, so great, there's nothing that he cannot do. And so making his this text, say, the God of Jacob, our help, and our hope, will make us truly, but you want to be truly blessed. And I do as well. And we can achieve that, when we make God, our our help and our hope. The fourth point that I want to mention this morning, is that we need to realize that God is able to strengthen and deliver anyone who puts their trust in Him. So we're going to go back here to the text of verses 79 I'll put it up on the screen in just a moment. Sometimes we think that God's strength and God's hope is just for certain people, maybe somebody's really strong maybe, you know, because Gil's a great leader, and a family man and an elder, and he's got he has more hope and strength. But the truth is, God's God's strengthens, and can deliver any one of us and every one of us. And that's what this text is suggesting. So look here, so I put up on the screen. And this is following the statement that, you know, we just made concerning how blessed it is he whose help is the God of Jacob, whose hope is in the Lord is God, who made heaven and earth to see and all this in them and keeps faith forever. And what else does God do? Look at all the people in this list, that God can help, say, who executes justice for the oppressed, who gives food to the hungry, the Lord gives freedom to the prisoners. The Lord opens the eyes of the blind. The Lord raises those who are bowed down. The Lord loves the righteous. The Lord watches over the strangers. He relieves the fatherless, the fatherless people who have who don't have parents, perhaps, and the widow, who doesn't have a spouse anymore. So look at all those people.

Mike Roy  23:38
That means whatever you struggle with in your life, or whatever I might struggle with in my life, God is able to bring us through this struggle, he is the God of hope. He is the God who helps us, the oppressed, the hungry, the prisoners, the blind, those bow down the righteous to strangers, the fatherless, and the widow. And that's not an exhaustive list. But that's just the picture of all the people that God can help. So we need to realize and remember that God is able to strengthen every single one of us and give hope to all people no matter what our circumstances might be. I didn't have to, I didn't notice when I was looking at this list over here, all the people that God helps, and constraint and gives hope to, but look at the last part of verse nine, it says, but the way of the wicked, he turns up, side down. So God can help anyone who reaches out to him who loves him and searches for him with all their strain. But the one who is resistant to God and denies God and opposes God. God flips that person upside down. He turns he turns that person upside down. The ESB I think says a brings him to ruin or destruction. Whatever it might be. So again, God's grace and strength is available to anyone who's willing to reach out to him. But for people who are stubborn and obstinate towards God, then they'll, they'll face his wrath. But as a reminder that God can help anyone one of the points that I want to mention this morning, in this lesson from this text, as we seek again, to live in happiness, or blessedness, and hope, praise God is the eternal King, we seemed like last few months be focused on God as a king more so and I think we need to do that. Because sometimes we forget that that that is God's position, his rightful place. And so in Psalm 146, and verse 10, says, The Lord will reign forever, your God, oh Zion to all generations praise the Lord. So the psalm ends with the same way it began with the phrase, the challenge for us to praise God. And he says that the Lord will reign forever. He said, Oh, you're your god, oh, Zion, or Jerusalem to all generations. So it's a reminder, that, that God is an eternal King, who will rule forever, you will need to remind ourselves of that one of the songs that we sometimes sing has this these words in it, the kingdoms of Earth, pass away one by one, but the Kingdom of Heaven remains. It is built on a rock and the Lord is its king, and forever and ever he reigns. And then the refrain says, It shall stand it shall stand forever and ever and ever, it shall stand a man in a men. And so it's a reminder, we need to and I think we need to remind ourselves, brethren, that we worship and we praise and we serve God who is an eternal King, there's no elections with God, He is the eternally existent one who was the king of kings, the Lord of all lords. And Paul made that same statement as he was encouraging Timothy to, in verse 14, keep the command without spot or blame into the peering of our Lord Jesus Christ, which God will bring about events in his own time, God, the blessing and only ruler, gods to blessed, an only rule of the King of kings, and Lord of lords, who alone is immortal, and who lives in unapproachable light, whom no one has seen or can say to him, Be honor, and might for ever, Amen. And so I think we need to tell ourselves, read, and I encourage you this morning, tell yourself, I'm on a winning team. I'm on the winning team. I'm serving the King of kings, the Lord of all lords, who is a tyrant, he's going to reign forever and ever is eternally victorious. And so are we, as we put our trust in our hope, and our great and awesome goddess reminder, also as God is an eternal King, and he reigns forever and ever. He also invites us and cause us to reign with him to share that. The incredible honor revelations, you have the two we talked about that recently. We can reign with God forever. And so as we review the lesson this morning, how do we live in this, and blessedness? And maybe we need to use that word more often happiness gets our attention, because we all want to be happy. But how do we live in blessedness? And how do we live in that in spite of sickness in spite of political changes in elections, and sometimes financial challenges and, and grief and all that stuff? How do we live in blessedness and hope? Well,

Mike Roy  28:34
we we praise the Lord, with all of our being and as long as we live, we said, Don't put your trust in political leaders who will all die. We need to make the God of Jacob our help and our hope. And number four, God is able to strengthen and deliver anyone who trust Him. And we praise God is the eternal King, who will rule for forever and ever and ever, and ever, and ever. There's no way I can get the right word to describe the extent of God's power and rule he rules forever. So the question that we leave you with this morning, will you live in blessedness? And in hope, in this 2021 Yes, this challenge we challenges that we face this last year. Difficulties will be challenges in 2021. But we keep pointing from Psalm 146. We can live in hope. We can live in this happiness or blessings in spite of what's going on in the world because God is greater So hope this lesson will be an encouragement to you. If someone needs to obey the gospel, if you need prayers for the struggles that you face, we would invite you to come forward while we stand and sing this invitation song
