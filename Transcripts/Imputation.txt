Unknown Speaker  00:00
Good evening, it's good to see each of you here this evening appreciate so much. Your presence is good be able to come tonight together to study God's word and to give praise to Him. And it's so good to be able to join with each of you in doing that. You go back and read some of the literature of the restores in the early restoration movement, they often would compose a slogan, to summarize some truth that they thought would be useful in teaching their religious neighbors. You know, there was a slogan like we are Christians, only. The point they were trying to make was that they didn't take on any other names, you know that, to describe themselves except for the name of Christian. Or there was a slogan, you know, we speak with the Bible speaks, and we're silent with the Bible is silent. That was a way of trying to summarize some of the things they believed about authority and how we should go to the Scriptures. But then another saying that, I think is useful. And one that I would like for us to think about tonight, to start off our thoughts, at least, that is, speaking of Bible things, and Bible ways. There are two there are two possible problems that can that can arise when we when we don't do that. The first would be if we were to use non Biblical words, to describe biblical things. Yes, to some extent, unavoidable English language is a very rich language. And there's a lot of words we have available to describe various concepts. And sometimes that's very helpful. But it can also lead to confusion. Even the restorers himself were confused about this. And that one example, would be the term universal church. Now we use that term on occasion to describe some of the passages that we read in New Testament speak about the church. And we use it as opposed to the term local church, because we see in the Scriptures about groups of people in a given location have come together to worship. And we see that they come together, and they work together in that community. And then there are some passages that people think maybe don't talk about a local church, but talking about all Christians, particularly maybe all time or any given point in time, and it would use the term Universal Church. The first thing to note is that term is not used in Scripture, right? The term universal church is not to be found. But it's a term that people use to try to describe something that they think is they can find in scriptures. So the very fact that we can't find it, though, we should kind of be wary. And be careful that we're not using some kind of non biblical term to describe something the scriptures could be confusing. That said, that restores himself. We're confused by this, because Alexander Campbell himself if I remember my history, correct, he reasoned something like this. The local church is a functioning body, that comes together to do work together, as a body of Christians. So therefore, if there is a universal church, that must mean that in some sense, the universal church also is a functioning body, and can do a work together. And it was that type of reasoning that allowed him to support missionary societies, he thought it was appropriate for churches of various locations to pool their money together, to do a work together as part of the universal church, and preaching the gospel. And so he justified it, in part based upon this concept of the universal church. Now, I don't believe he was correcting that I don't think you are believe he is correcting that. And maybe if he had not used the term universal church, perhaps you would never gone down that path. But who knows, maybe you've gone down that path anyway. But the point I guess I was just trying to make at this point is it gotta be careful when we try to use non Biblical words to describe biblical concepts, because it may lead us down a path that takes us away from Scripture. A second impossible problem is when we use Biblical words in a non biblical way, actually think this is a more dangerous problem or possible problem. And I would use the example of what a baptism there is often used by some to refer to both infant baptism or baptism, done by sprinkling.

Curtis Byers  04:48
Now, New Testament, baptism is never used in either those two ways. It simply means to immerse. So it's clearly referring to immersion and in the news, Testament we only read of believers being baptized, we never read of infants being baptized. But when the term baptism has been appropriate about those who practice infant baptism, or sprinkling as a mode of baptism, that can cause a lot of confusion and can cause a great danger because say someone has been sprinkled, or someone was baptized as an infant. And they hear someone speaking, you know, preaching about the necessity be baptized. Now, the New Testament demands that one is baptized into Christ. Well, in their mind, they say, Well, okay, I've already done that. I was baptized as an infant, or I was baptized, or sprinkling, and therefore, that's good. I agree with that. I think I've done that. Well, they haven't done it at all right, using the Bible way of describing baptism, but they have by using it, according to a definition that's foreign to the Scriptures. So we got to be careful not to redefine words that we find in Scripture. Because in doing that we're going with contrary to Scripture, and we can lead people astray. That's not all that to say. There's another word though, that I like for us to think about tonight. That's a biblical word. But it's often used in non biblical ways. So that's what I want to talk about the word is, you'll never guessed the word I should probably ask you to try to guess the word. But I guarantee you would not guess this word. And the word is impute anybody would have anybody would have guessed that word. Okay. Somebody might would have guessed that word. is the word we don't use very often, there's a word that we use find in the King James Version. And that word, those are good words found is translated different ways in Scripture. And the basic meaning of the word impute is simply to consider that's the primary meaning, as all times in Scripture when people come together to reason, or to consider something is this word that's being used to describe that reasoning. But the way we tend to think of the word is more in a secondary sense. As these ADGER these synonyms probably help us to kind of narrow the thought down when we ascribe or assign or credit, or reckon or count something to someone else. That is imputing something to them. All right, so that's the idea of imputed. Yeah, and that's since the Scripture doesn't use the word that word very often, in fact, Romans four is about the only place in scripture you see it, you see is the a couple times the Old Testament. And the fact those occasions are those are both referred to here in Romans four. And there's over a First Corinthians and Hebrews a couple of places, but as most places, as found found 11 times here, Romans four. Now let's just read these verses that I put on the screen to kind of get a sense of what Paul meant, when he used this term, impute rose for three for what the Scriptures say, Abraham believed God and was countered to him as righteousness. Bless her, those whose Wallace these are forgiven, whose sins are covered blesses the man against Him, the Lord will not count his sin. Verse nine, where we say that faith was counted to Abraham, as righteousness. And then later in verses 22 and following, that is why his faith was counted to him as righteousness. But the words it was counted to him were not written for his sake alone. But if our for ours also, it will be counted to us who believe in Him who raised of who raised from the dead, Jesus, our Lord. He said, The word compute is not in there well, right. If you go to the King James Version, it uses both the word count and impute and dependable what translation boy that didn't turn out very well. So what happened there? Depending on what translation use of words like reckon, or credit, would be used instead, the English Standard uses the word count and all those instances. So it's the same word. Now as you look at these verses, and as you reflect upon your study of this passage in the past, in fact, we're studying Romans right now, because part of the reason why this has come to my mind to talk about it.

Curtis Byers  09:33
What is what is Paul's saying, is imputed. The first question to be asked what is being imputed, impute means being reckoned being counted, being assigned being credited? Well, the thing that's being credited is faith. Right? Faith is what is counted as righteousness. And that faith verse nine, that faith was counted. had faith was imputed to Abraham as righteousness. So the thing that's been imputed in this passage is faith. Right? And that's the great truth. That was true of Abraham is true of the people under the New Covenant, that God will accept a person's faith as righteousness. Paul, in the first few chapters of Romans made the point clear, I think, that we're all sinners before God that all men have sinned and fallen short of the God's glory. Right? So if we're going to depend upon ourselves, there's no way that we can be considered righteous, Nazo Lord, you just can't happen. But the Lord is gracious. And the Lord has said that he will take one's faith and impute that as righteousness. And that's the great truth of the gospel. And that's true for Jews is true for Gentiles is true, for oldest true for young is true for people in Africa is true for people here are people in Japan makes no difference is true for all people of all time, faith will be counted as righteousness. Now, that's the single truth, the single use of this term in Scripture that I'm aware of. And that's used in this sense. But that has not kept people from thinking and taking this term and using it in other ways. The fact there are three imputations that people in the religious world talk about, they use the term impute, and each of these three senses since its, first they talked about the imputation of Adam's sin, to all people of all time, they also talked about the imputation of the sin of God's people to Christ, and also the imputation of Christ's righteousness to God's people. Now, the primary texts that people used refer to these come from the book of Romans. And again, it's because what we were saying the book of Romans, while this topic came to mind, we've already talked about this. I'm not Trump, I'm not tripping up on Conrad study, Conrad's doing a very good job in his study these passes we've already looked at, but I think he would agree that we can cover everything. So I thought this might be a supplement, to similar study. Now all three of these positions are held up, I'm gonna hit myself we pulled that thought was good thought. But hold on for a second, I'm not quite there yet. Let me explain what these three amputations mean, a little more carefully. You know, in the beginning, God created Adam and Eve, and he had made this promise to them. And he also told them not to do something. But Adam when he seen and, according to this teaching, his sin was imputed to all people who followed him all his offspring, his sin was imputed, it was placed to their account, okay, that's what impute means it was placed to their account. Now, as time progressed over time, there were people like Abraham, and then there are people, even the day, who are God's people, because of faith. Not all people, but within all people, there are some who could be classified as God's people.

Curtis Byers  13:27
And this teaching was say that the sins of these people are imputed to Christ. Right? That the sins are placed to his account. And in turn, the righteousness of Christ, His obedience, his good works, his submission to the Father's will, even to death. His righteousness would be imputed back to God's people. Right? That's, that's the essence of these three imputations. Right. Now, pick it up what I was going to say, all three of these are held by what I call a classic Calvinists. Classic Calvinists are those who kind of took the system of Calvin and refined it and polished it and made it into a complete system. And if you talk about Calvinism, these three amputations are part of their understanding of Scripture. It also turns out that the first two are also held by Catholics. Catholics would agree about the fact that Adam sin was impute imputed to the rest of mankind. And they would also talk about some ways that are seen as being imputed to Christ. They don't specifically talk about the third effect, they think of justifications I'm gonna defer. I'm gonna put a little light green box around there because they have tried to moderate their views somewhat to be a little bit more compatible with Protestants. So anyways, some extent these teachings are held both by Calvinists, and by Protestants, or at least those defined by Calvinism. So all I do is just look at these three each of these three just a little more carefully, to see what they're saying, and seeing what the dangers that are to be found in these teachings. First, let's talk about the imputation of Adam's sin to all people of all time. First, they will say that Adam was created in a state of original righteousness. And when he was when Adam was created, he was perfect. He had no sin. And it was his choice whether or not he was going to follow God's will or not. So he was in a state of what they would call original righteousness, he was righteous because he had no sin. But he made the choice freely to sin. So when he did that, he brought guilt upon himself. His then brought guilt upon himself. But not only that, they argue that that guilt has been transferred, placed upon all his offspring from that point on. People call it by different names. Sometimes people call about original sin. Sometimes people use the term total hereditary depravity. Sometimes people use the term total inability. But in any case, this this corrupt nature, and Adams nature has now been corrupted. And that corrupt nature has been passed down to his offspring, as because it all offspring now has this corrupt nature does, that's why we've seen it. That's all we can do. Right? And they just be more specific. They mean by this, that all people are sinners by birth, right, from the very moment that we are born into this world, we are a sinner before God, because Adam sin has been placed to our account. I'm sorry, if for some reason, things are not lining up quite right. And by that they mean people do not have the ability to do good. They do not have the desire, nor do they have the ability to do good, they can't choose good either. All they can do is choose what is evil, because their nature has been corrupted. So all they can do is evil, and has all people are condemned everlasting death, based upon Adam's sin. All people are condemned. I mean, in other words are guilty before God, and would be condemned if God had not intervened. Where's this doctrine taught? Well, Romans 512, the passage we looked at a couple of weeks ago in our Bible class, they would point to this passage, which says, Therefore, just as sin came into the world through one man and death through sin, and so death spread to all men, because all seen it. Now look at that passage carefully.

Curtis Byers  17:57
Something is passed to all men. Something is passed on man. But as a sin has passed on me, that's what they say has been passed on man. Now that this doctrine of Adam's sin being imputed, says that his sin has passed to all men. Is that was been passed on in this passage. No, it says Death has been passed to all men. Now, that is a small haul but a substantial difference. Right? I would grant that because Adam sin made it so that God placed him out of the Garden of Eden, Eden, he no longer had access to the tree of life, I would grant that we all die physically, because of Adam's sin. I think that is a truth that we can find and justify a scripture. Right. That's the point he's making here in Romans five that all have died through Adam. That is not the same as saying that all have been may sinners in Adam. That's that's a difference as a big difference. The passage just does not say that. So they use the word impute, to refer to the sin that's been imputed as using a biblical word and a non biblical way. That's inevitably going to cause confusion and going to lead people down a wrong path. Now, how do you how does this How does this work? Why does this the case well, Calvin and Augustine before him and others often will say something like, well, just the birthing process itself, that the nature of man has been corrupted and the nature of man is, is passed on from one generation to another as the birthing process, and therefore that is the way that this corrupt nature has been passed out? Have some hold to the theory was called realism. Now this was held by some of the early church fathers or grandfathers in particular. And you got to think the way they thought the way they thought, in order to make sense of this. They believe that all souls were present, all souls, your soul MASL all souls for all people of all time, were present there in the beginning. And we were all there with Adam there in the garden. So when Adam made the choice to sin, we all made the choice to sin. And so therefore, it's really not true to talk of as an imputation. Rather, it is our sin because we chose to see and when Adam chose the sin, so there's a realistic sense in which we are guilty because of our own choice. That's the realistic view. That view is still still popular in some quarters, even today, takes a little bit of philosophy that philosophical leanings that most of us just don't, don't share. Most people who hold this view, but hold this would hold to what's called a federal headship idea. And they by this, they mean that when God told Adam, not to take the Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil, that God had made Adam, a representative head for all mankind. He was the first and he was going to stand at our place, he was going to be our representative. And whatever he chose to do, would be applied to us. So if Adam had chose to do good, and chose never to have sinned, and that would, that would have been placed to our credit. But if Adam were just sin, then that too would be placed to our credit. So says, Adam sin, as our representative, then you could talk in a true sense about that sin being imputed to us, is counted as ours, even though it was it is counted as ours, because that's the way God arranged it. So that's what they mean by how would work? Well, when you start using Biblical words and non biblical ways, we started going down the path, you're gonna find yourself in some, some tough spots at some point or another. So the question is, what about Jesus?

Curtis Byers  22:37
Jesus was a man, Jesus was born of a woman, did he have this original sin? That's legitimate question, right? Well, the Catholic saw that with their view of what's called the Immaculate Conception of Mary, not the virgin birth, but the Immaculate Conception of Mary. They believe that Mary herself when she was conceived, that the Holy Spirit protected her from sin, so that she was not tainted by the original sin. And so that, therefore, she could not pass it on to Jesus when Jesus was conceived in her by the Holy Spirit. That's what they mean by the Immaculate Conception. That also goes along with their ideal worshipping Mary, because they don't believe Mary sinned. She didn't have original sin, and so she didn't see. So that's one of the ways they justify worshipping her. Protestants wouldn't have none of that. But they did say that somehow or another, the Holy Spirit's sanctified Jesus and kept him from having Original Sin. So you find a place in Scripture about that? Well, no. But you can find things about Scripture about the original sin either, right? So but they have to do something, say something to get out of the quandary. Well, not only that, what about babies? You know, what about the baby who were was born in this world? Are we saying that that baby is a sinner? That what happens if that baby dies? Whatever that baby is, that is that baby going to be lost forever. Catholics had a way of solving that problem. That's why infant baptism. Now it's interesting to note though, if a baptism came first, right, the teaching on infant baptism came before the teaching on original sin. So it's interesting how that were, they used if a baptism to justify the belief of original sin, and that's seems like I got it backwards. But in the Catholic theology, if a baptism takes away the original sin, not so among the Protestants and the Protestants, you still have the original sin forever. You never get rid as long as you're in this life. You never get rid of original sin. Whether you're baptized as infants are baptized in an adult makes no difference. You still have Original Sin. Okay. Let's go to the next imputation and imputation of God's people sin, the sin of God's people to Christ. Somebody simply say God's people are those who are justified by faith. And that's not really the point of this lesson bless except that. So what they and what do they mean when they say that people to God's people seeing in the synagogues people is imputed to Christ, there's two ways that that could be understood, and some understanding to be true in both senses and some of the woods. First of all it could mean is that God's, the sin of God's people is actually placed upon Jesus, that he actually takes the guilt of the sin, he actually becomes a sinner. Right, and that he is guilty before God, because he has taken the sins of the people upon him. Some some hold of that understanding, some also hold, that is true, that the penalty that should be his people's is paid by Jesus. Again, some people would hold both of these, some would only hold this second view, they will not hold the first but it would hold the second view only, which says is not the guilt that has placed upon Jesus is simply the penalty that is placed upon Jesus, I would agree with that second statement and not the first, right. I don't think the word imputation would be a good word to use, because the Bible doesn't use that term to describe that. But the idea of Jesus being a substitute in our stead, that he took the death that we deserved, I think as a biblical ideal, so the second part I would agree with, and that's all that some people mean by imputing of our sin to Jesus, some mean more than that by saying the actual sin itself has been given to Jesus. I don't want to deal with this one, as long as I spoke on that a couple of years ago, and more lean, but let's, let's go to the third one. And that is the imputation of Christ's righteousness to his people, the imputation of Christ's righteousness to people. Now, if I put up here, a section from the Westminster Confession of Faith, to be a little bit more precise, and wording, how they would say this, the Westminster Confession of Faith is kind of the standard for classic Calvinism. That is, if you want to know what classic Calvinism is, this is the document you would go to. And everybody would acknowledge that, I think. So let's let's first read this statement, then we'll go back and look at some a little more carefully.

Curtis Byers  27:28
It says those who God effectually call us. And he could tell us as a holder of document because he got the call us and type words, he also freely justify it, not by infusing righteousness into them. But by pardoning their sins and about counting, accepting their persons as Rice's not for anything wrong in them or done by them, but for Christ's sake alone. Nor by imputing, faith itself, the act of believing or any other evangelical obedience to them as their righteousness. But by imputing, the obedience and satisfaction of Christ on to them, they receive and you're resting on Him and His righteousness by faith, which faith they have not of themselves. It is the gift of God. That first statement where it says those who got effectually call us an important statement, understand Calvinists, and we don't have time to pursue this. But that's basically referring to predestination to election. See what other teaching that they have that goes before all this other is that the people who are saved or ultimately those who God chose to be saved by name, that he before the foundation, the world that he looked over all time. And he said that Bob and Mary and Sue and Joe were going to be saved, and nobody else was going to be saved. And only those who are going to be saved are the ones that he calls. Right. So that's what they mean by those who got effectually calls only that elect is being under consideration here. And this says that he justifies them not by infusing righteousness into them. Now that ideally confusing righteousness, probably sounds odd to us. But that was the standard Catholic way of describing justification. Catholics before Calvinism would typically describe justification means that the that rice God infuses righteousness into us over time. And as time progresses, our self our will we cooperate with God's will, and we become more and more righteous over time. Justification wasn't a singular act. It was a lifelong process. So justification was a long process, and they use the term infusing righteousness to describe that process. So so the Westminster document here is saying it's not that it's not what the Catholics teach. He justifies not that way. But in Catholic and Protestant thought, there's two acts, there's justification, which is that one time act when you have faith, and then they add to that sanctification, which is a long process. So what Protestants mean by justification and sanctification, the Catholics mean by just infusing righteousness. But says we're only talking about justification right now, it's only that first part that we're talking about that point in time when God considers one righteous, okay? Now notice what it says. And think back about Romans four that we just looked at a few moments ago, about what it said was imputed. What did we say was was imputed in Romans four, faith was imputed, right over and over. And that passage is faith that is imputed. But listen to what they say, is not by imputing faith itself, the act of leaving, or any other evangelicals, obedience to them as their righteousness. I'm sorry, but that directly contradicts Romans four, as a direct opposite of what Romans four says. But they have to get that all the way. Because they want to go on and say that they're going to impute the obedience and satisfaction of Christ unto them. The obedience of Christ, both his passive act of obedience that we talked about, would be transferred to the Christian will be imputed to them in his act of justification, the scriptures doesn't say that. But they use the word impute and peepees you is amazing. When you read commentators, Calvinists, commentators are Romans for how they can use the language to make you think that righteousness of Christ is being imputed in that passage. All they gotta do is to stop, say no way, saying, Oh, what did Paul say? Because because they're using the same language of the Bible, but they're using it in a non biblical way. It's easy to get turned around. It's easy to get confused. Right? And I believe that's what's happened here in this passage. Now, just to summarize, you know, the Romans four is the primary pass, there is no other passage that they can really go to maybe

Curtis Byers  32:27
there was one pastor First Corinthians a little bit, but Romans four is the passage that they would go to to try to substantiate his teaching. And they say that there's two things that take place at the same time that God forgives sins at the same point in time and imbues the righteousness of Christ to His people. Well, we read about the forgiveness of sins, that's all we need to read about, right? What happens when we are justified? What does the Scripture say happens when we are justified, but God forgives our sins. That's what he means by that's what justification means in Scripture is on the basis of our faith, our trust our acceptance of Jesus, right, our obedience to Him has been the basis of our faith. But we are justified when God washes away our sins, He forgives our sins, right? But in this system, and this system, remember, people still have original sin. So, in Calvinism, people always still are sinners, until the day that they die, they are still sinners. Right, and will again not be anything else. So they treat the righteousness of Christ, like a garment, like a piece of clothing that you put on over the body of sin. Right? That's the language they use. You put on the righteousness of Christ like a road that covers up the sin. And so when God in heaven looks down upon the Christian, instead of seeing the sin in this in them, he sees the righteousness of Christ that covers the seasons, and therefore he's going to accept people because he sees Christ's righteousness. That's not the image of Scripture. The image the teaching of Scripture is that when we believe and obey, we are forgiven of our sins. The Christian is not a sinner. Can we see it? Yes, we can see in basketball Jarvis says that when we sin, we have an advocate with the Father, who will forgive us of our sins, right? We are been forgiven of our sins. We are called to live a sanctified life a life has been set apart. You know, and I thank you. The problem with his teaching is if you tell people that they are still sinners, but Christ's righteousness is going to be taken care of it was just the end result of that teaching. People are going to still see in, there's no encouragement not to see it. Because no matter how much you've seen, Christ's righteousness is still going to cover you up. And that sin cannot be seen. That's not the message of the New Testament. That's not the message in New Testament. This teaching the fastest way in our songs all the time, the first verse of the solid rock, my hope is built nothing less than Jesus blood and righteousness. That's kind of in the script that can that can mean a lot of different things. There is a sense that we are saved by the righteousness of Christ. How's that? Well, it because he was a sacrifice, right? If Christ was not righteous, He would have not been the perfect sacrifice. If he wasn't a perfect sacrifice, we could not have our sins forgiven. So there is a sense that our righteousness our hope is built upon the righteousness of Christ. But if you go on down to verse four, though, you know the word you know, this song, dressed in his righteousness alone. They're teaching the imputation of Christ's righteousness. I just don't sing that phrase who get to that point in that song, I just kind of go mute. You know, not that I think. I understand. You can you know, songs, poetry, sometimes you might have a little bit of license in so forth and so on. But that that is Blyton plate wrong. We are not dressed in the righteousness of Christ. No, we're not. We're forgiven in Christ for the song. And kind of be the last verse there that actually is versus not in our song books. This is in the original song was as enclosed in righteousness divine, I think only the first three verses are in our blue songbook, I believe.

Curtis Byers  36:55
But as a prevalent teaching, and it's almost impossible if you listen to anybody in a religious world, and nowadays, particularly in the conservative evangelical mode, this type of language, having the righteousness of Christ and Peter to us or being dressed in the righteousness of surprise, all that type of languages is commonplace. And my point is, is simply this. They're using a biblical word in a non biblical way. And that should cause us pause, that should cause us to pick up little bit set up a little straighter, to be a little more careful to say what is it that they're trying to say? Because it seems like what they're saying, is exactly opposite of what is said in Scripture. And that's what we got to be careful about. So it's wise to speak about Bible things, and Bible ways. And if we do that, we can doesn't guarantee that we're not going to be wrong in our thinking of some point along the way, but we're probably going to be less likely to go wrong in our thinking. If we simply stick to the way the Bible describes things and use the Bible's words the way that we're using the Bible. Oh, that's been of some help. And benefit. I began with, it seemed obvious to me that this might be a good topic since we've been studying the book of Romans. Book of Romans is a battleground among between Christians and Calvinists have the years and this is something that we ought to be at least aware of, as we go about talking to other people. But if there's nobody here, if there's anybody here tonight, who has not yet become a Christian, we will simply want to tell you of the great blessing to be found in Christ. We can have our sins forgiven in Christ. On the basis of our faith, faith is a is a strong word in Scripture. And I think the best word to use to describe faith is trust. Is TRUST and OBEY as a way of good way of describing people who have faith in God believe God for what He says, and trust him and what he says. And if we trust God, and what he says, They will simply want to do whatever God says, that's what we would call upon you to do tonight, if you're not a Christian, and want to become a Christian, to have the blessings or be found in Christ and forgiveness of our sins so we can stand before God on the day of judgment, forgiven by the blood of His Son, present the subject the invitation, we encourage you to come at this time as we stand in the same room.
