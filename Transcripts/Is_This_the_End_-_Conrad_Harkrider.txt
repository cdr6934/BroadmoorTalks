If you want to open your Bibles up to Matthew chapter 24. That's where we're going to be setting from the rest of our time, Matthew 24.

Conrad Harkrider  00:23
It's so good to be back with you after some sickness in our house, we my family, and I really appreciate all of the calls and the texts and the cards, and the food, and of course, your prayers. It's such a blessing to be a part of a group, a family like Broadmoor, where we can encourage and support and help one another. When we face various challenges. Over the past few weeks, we have been reflecting on the previous year 2020. As the year has, the previous year has come to an end It's sunset is closing. And we've been thinking about the events and what's happened and kind of looking forward to the coming year. And 2020 was a year that we will not soon forget, there was no shortage of newsworthy events. The global pandemic that was caused by the COVID 19 virus was unlike anything that we have ever experienced in our lives. And it wasn't just the virus, there was a number of natural disasters that affected our world. If you remember back at the beginning of 2020, there was a wildfire that started in Australia that burned over 47 million acres. Of course, here in the United States, on the western coast, there were hundreds of 1000s of people who were displaced from their homes because of the wildfires. In Central America, there were two hurricanes that hit practically back to back that caused billions of dollars of damage. And even here in Nashville, we saw the tornadoes that ripped through the city in the month of March. But outside of the natural disasters, there were all kinds of social unrest. There was political upheaval, there were protests and riots. We witnessed bombings in Beirut, Lebanon, and also here in Nashville on Christmas morning. I was talking with someone recently about all these things that have happened in 2020. And they said it feels like the world is coming to an end. And in many ways our world has been turned upside down, feels very different than when we started 2020. And I've been thinking about that, with all of the events and the things that we've seen, we look around us, we might ask the question, Is this the end? Is the world coming to an end? And what does the Bible say about that? Are there signs?

Conrad Harkrider  03:10
Are there indications that we can look around us and tell? Yes, this is things are about to conclude they're about to close the world is going to end? What does the Bible say about this world coming to an end? I'd like for us to think about that question and also about our response. How do we respond to the unsettling events that we see around us? Well, let's read from Matthew chapter 24, beginning of verse one, as Jesus is speaking to His disciples about some uncertain events. Matthew 24, beginning in verse one, it says, Then Jesus went out and departed from the temple. And his disciples came to show him the buildings of the temple. And Jesus said to them, Do you not see all these things? Assuredly, I say to you, not one stone shall be left here upon another, that shall not be thrown down. Now, as he sat on the Mount of all this, the disciples came to him privately saying, Tell us, when will these things be? And what will be the sign of Your coming at the end of the age? And Jesus answered and said to them, Take heed that no one deceives you, for many will come in My name is saying, I am the Christ, and will deceive many. And you will hear of wars and rumors of wars. See that you are not troubled for all these things must come to pass, but the end is not yet. For nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom and there will be famines, pestilences and earthquakes in various places, and these are the beginning of sorrows. Then they will deliver you up to tribulation and kill you and you will be hated by all nations for my namesake. And then many will be offended and will betray one another and will hate one another, then many false prophets will rise up and deceive many, and because of lawlessness, and because lawlessness will abound, the love of many will grow cold, but he who endures to the end shall be saved. And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in all the world as a witness to all the nations, and then the end will come. In a recent Pew Research poll, they found that 40% of Americans believe that Jesus will probably or definitely return to Earth by 2050 40%, there's a large population of our country that believes that in the next 30 years, the world as we know it, is going to come to an end for 1000s of years people have thought about this question. When is the world going to end and there have been numerous predictions in 2012, the Mayan calendar was set to end and the world was supposed to supposed to conclude at that point. And even in Jesus time, the disciples asked this question about when is the end of the age? Well, let's notice the context. Here Jesus is with his disciples, it's the last week before he's going to be crucified. He's in Jerusalem, they're walking around looking at all of the buildings in the temple complex.

Conrad Harkrider  06:50
And as they're looking at this amazing structure that has been built, Jesus makes the shocking statement in verse two. He says, Not one stone will be left upon another. This temple was built by Herod the Great, it's a magnificent structure, an amazing architectural feat, and Jesus says that it is going to be completely leveled. John chapter two and verse 20, tells us that it took Herod and his workers over 46 years to complete the temple. Historians tell us that there were over 10,000 workmen working on the project, some of the stones that have been found that are still here today that were part of the foundation are over 250 tonnes in weight. That's like taking six semi trucks and loading them up to capacity. That's how big or how heavy one of these stones would be in Don't ask me how they were able to move that without cranes and diesel powered machinery, but moving it into place. This was one of the most impressive buildings in the ancient world, and Jesus says it's going to come to nothing. Well, that's a statement that caught the attention of the disciples. And so in verse three, when they get with Jesus privately on the Mount of Olives, they asked him, when is this going to happen? When are these things going to take place? And not just the destruction of the temple? But they throw in some bonus questions? When is the end of the age? What is the sign of your coming? Just tell us when all of the big events are going to happen in the future? Well, in response to that question, Jesus outlines what the coming days are going to look like. He gives them a picture into future events, and not just what's going to happen, but then he will also emphasize their response. How should they respond to these things that are about to take place? Well, notice some of the dangers that Jesus mentions. Look back in verse four. It says, Take heed that no one deceives you, for many will come in My name, saying I am the Christ and deceive many. Down in verse 11. It says, Many false prophets will rise up and deceive many this idea of deception. Jesus warns that many will be led astray. There are going to be imposters, people that come to claim that they are the Christ, the Messiah. The Jewish people were anxiously waiting for the Messiah, looking forward to the promised one that would come and deliver God's people. And many of them were a anxiously looking for someone who had bring military power and strength, someone who could overcome. They're the ones who ruled over them to overpower the Roman government and restore the Jewish nation. In Acts chapter five and verse 36, if you remember when Gamaliel was speaking to the council, and he's trying to calm them down, they were. And they were trying to put Paul and or put Peter rather and some of the other apostles to death, and they had them on trial. And Gmail, Gmail, email reminds them of a couple of other instances of people who had tried to lead others away. He mentions a man by the name of foodists, who had 400 followers. And also there was Judas the Galilean who tried to lead a revolt. And his point in bringing up these examples is that there are always people who are trying to start a following trying to get people to come after to listen to what they have to say. And his point is, is that if what Peter and the apostles are doing is for a man, it's just going to come to nothing, it will eventually be dispersed. But if this is from God, you will not be able to stop it. Jesus warned His disciples about a time when many people would be led astray. When there are periods of difficulty and crisis,

Conrad Harkrider  11:41
it is a fact that people are more vulnerable and susceptible to listening and believing something that is not true. Jesus recognize that and knew that there would be these opportune moments for false teachers and false prophets to come in and lead God's people astray. As one university professor noted during times of crisis when difficult decisions need to be made, people are looking for ways to cope with the challenges that they face, they are more likely to become enthralled by a conspiracy theory. And in the 1920s, Germany was reeling over their losses from World War One. Millions of people had been killed, the country was in a complete state of shock and poverty. It was during that time that the nation was reflecting and they were asking a lot of questions. Why did this happen? They thought they were on the path to victory during the war. And then everything collapsed, and it was a great defeat. So they're trying to figure out how did all this happen? Why were we defeated? What was going on what went wrong? And it was during that time that there was a very charismatic and influential man that rose up power craving sociopath who came on the national stage. He had an explanation for why all of these things had occurred. Adolf Hitler explained that all of the problems faced by Germany were because of the Jews, what he referred to as the Jewish influence. And so He seized on those emotions. He took an opportunity from people who were in distress and lead an entire country down a path of destruction. Well, the lesson for us today is that it's important to guard our hearts and our minds, to think about the influences to not give attention to things that are misleading to realize that we are more susceptible and vulnerable. When things are uncertain or difficult, as Paul warned Timothy, and second Timothy chapter two and verse 23, he said, have nothing to do with foolish, ignorant controversies. You know that they breed quarrels and the Lord servant must not be quarrelsome, but kind to everyone able to teach, patiently enduring evil. Paul tells Timothy have nothing to do with these things. Ignorant, foolish controversies. I think we sometimes get into the habit of weighing in on every argument on every controversy on every discussion that's out there. We don't have to comment on every post or listen to every commentary. Sometimes it's better just to turn the TV off to put the phone down to refocus our minds on the things that we know are true on God's promises and His Word, to not allow ourselves to be led astray. Also notice verse six and verse seven, Matthew 24. He says, and you will hear of wars and rumors of wars see that you are not troubled for all these things must come to pass. But the end is not yet for Nation will rise against nation and kingdom against kingdom. And there will be famines, and pestilences and earthquakes. in various places. Jesus warns that disasters will continue to come. He makes mention of wars, nations rising against nations famines, and earthquakes. These are things that are disasters, they displace people, they cause lots of human suffering.

Conrad Harkrider  15:58
Some of these are brought about by the actions of men, conflicts, wars. However, some of these things are outside of our control, natural disaster, food shortages, famines. But notice the end of verse six, what he says, After all these things have happened. He says, The end is not yet these things are going to occur, but this is not the end of the world. Also, notice in verse 34, Matthew 24, verse 34, he says, uh, surely I say to you, this generation will by no means pass away, till all these things take place. So the people who are listening the disciples, they are still going to be alive, their generation will not pass away the for these things to occur. Also notice in verse 36, he says, But of that day and hour, no one knows not even the angels of heaven, but my father, only Jesus goes on to talk about how God's judgment that coming day is something that's going to happen without any warning that people will not be aware of when that day is coming. We know from history that the temple of Jerusalem was destroyed in the year at 70, by the Roman General Titus, after the Jews had staged a revolt. So what Jesus is describing here is these tumultuous events that were leading up to the destruction of the temple. The point is that these disasters are not a sign of the End of the World tragedies, catastrophes, bad things are a part of living in a world that is broken. Every generation, since the time of Christ has had to face distressing events. In the first and second centuries, Christians were thrown into the arena, to face wild animals. Throughout history, there have been conflicts that have totally up ended people's way of life where people were living. Imagine living in the fifth century when Attila the Hun overran Europe, or in the ninth century, when the Vikings came down from this Scandinavian countries and completely overtook England. Or what about in the 13th century, when Ganga is Khan overtook nearly 12 million square miles of land and killed or displaced over 40 million people? Or how about living during World War One when the Spanish Flu affected millions of people. And the war and the flu together claimed over 70 million lives, nearly 5% of the world's population. This doesn't minimize what we're facing today. But when we look back at history, it can give us a sense of perspective. It can also remind us that as long as the world stands, there's going to be difficulties, challenges, things that we face.

Conrad Harkrider  19:18
And all of these tragedies, what is the response that they should produce in God's people? A greater sense of dependence. So we're talking about this year, holding God's hand holding on to the Lord has our grip on his hand has it gotten tighter this past year with all the things that we've been through, realizing that God is the one constant? He's the one source of stability in a world that is constantly changing? It should also produce a sense of discomfort, restlessness, realizing that we don't Want to stay in this life forever this place is not our eternal and never ending dwelling place that we want to go and be with the Lord, we desire the life to come. In Matthew chapter six and verse 19. It says, Do not lay up for yourselves treasures on earth, where moth and rust destroy and where thieves break in and steal. But lay up for yourselves treasures in heaven where neither moth nor rust destroy and where thieves do not break in and steal. For where your treasure is. there your heart will be also Jesus warns his disciples, don't put your hope, your trust in things that can be destroyed, where someone can break in and steal and damage and harm and take it away. Instead, place your whole place your treasure in something that can never be destroyed or damaged, or taken away. Also, look at verse nine. Notice what he says in verse nine, he says, then they will deliver you up to tribulation and kill you and you will be hated by all nations. For my namesake. When Jesus lays out the events that are coming, he says in verse nine that those who follow Christ, Christians are going to face persecution, he warns his disciples about what is coming, that they are going to be handed over to the courts. There will be charges that are filed accusations that are made, and then the sentence of death that is handed down, not because of something that they had done wrong, not because of their actions, but because of what they believed, because they were followers, disciples of Jesus Christ. This persecution was not going to be in one area or one town, but he says you will be hated by all nations, God's people would, would face this resistance throughout the entire world. And actually, after 12, we read about the first apostle, who was martyred James, the brother of John, we're not giving many details, we know that it was Herod who put him to death. And Luke doesn't tell us much about what the circumstances were. But he says that it pleased the Jews. They were desiring to have the power, the authority, the preeminence among the people. And so they were satisfied when these other men who started to gain reputation and standing among the people when they were taken out of the way, in the book of Revelation, in chapter 17, in verse six, John describes this woman, the he refers to her as Babylon the Great, and he says that she became drunk with the blood of the saints, this excessive indulgence, drinking down the death and the suffering of God's people, Christians, God's people would continue to face persecution. You know, the last couple 100 years, we have found ourselves in a very unusual time.

Conrad Harkrider  23:24
We are not physically persecuted for our beliefs in this country. But that can easily change in our lifetime or in the lifetime of our children. There are others throughout the world that are physically persecuted because of their faith in Christ. And if our status or our circumstances do change, how will we respond? What will be our reaction to the pressure? If we're faced if we're if we're persecuted for our faith in Christ? Well, notice what Jesus encourages his disciples to do in the circumstances. Look at verse 12. As we think about our response to these things, he says in verse 12, and because of lawlessness, and because lawlessness will abound, the love of many will grow cold. Our response to challenges and hard, difficult things, is to let love burn bright. To let love burn bright Jesus warns about the possibility of people's love growing cold, that there would be this feeling of indifference that people would no longer care what's happening to those around them. In the parable, the Good Samaritan Jesus told about a man who was traveling from Jerusalem down to Jericho And as as he was on that road, he came upon a group of robbers men who beat him, took his possessions, robbed him of his clothes and left him for dead. And as he was lying there helpless on the road, there was a priest, a holy man of God that came by and passed him, saw him lying there, but continued on his way. Jesus says next, that there was a Levite, a man who was an assistant, a helper among God's servants in the temple. And yet he saw the man lying there, and he continued, on his way. Disregard an apathy. For the plight for the suffering of other people, is something that all of us have to fight against. But especially when we are faced with a period of adversity, when we ourselves come under trouble, it can cause us to lose our sensitivity, our compassion, our concern for the people around us.

Conrad Harkrider  26:15
God's people must continue to burn brightly, our love cannot be extinguished because of pressure because of suffering because of difficulty. In First Kings chapter 18, during the time of Ahab and Jezebel, one of the worst periods in the history of God's people, as Jezebel was going around, and she was executing the prophets of God. First Kings 18. And verse four tells us about a man named Obadiah, who actually worked for King Ahab. But he was a believer in God. And he went and found some of the prophets who were still alive, and he hid them into caves. And not just hid them away. But he continued to provide for them, bringing them food and water, he put his life on the line, he risked his own personal safety, to help those who are most vulnerable. When conditions around us get dark, our light has to shine even brighter. We can't just go into a hole and wait for the Lord to come, we have to keep working. We have to keep serving, we have to keep helping and ministering towards those who are in need. That may look different because of the circumstances that we're in. But think about people living during the 1918 flu pandemic. They couldn't communicate as easily they didn't have cell phones, they couldn't send a text message. There are so many needs around us are we using the the tools and the blessings that we have to encourage to strengthen, to support to not allow our love to grow cold, let that love, burn bright. Also notice verse 13, he says, But he who endures to the end will be saved during times of testing, Jesus reminds his disciples that we must endure to the end, we must endure to the end. One of the core pillars of our faith. One of the central tenants of our faith is this idea of endurance, to not give up, to not slow down to continue on to resist temptation to refuse to compromise. Despite what might be happening around us a number of years ago, I ran in the Nashville half marathon race that was held annually here in the city. This was before we had kids. And the last course the last part of the course is extremely challenging. It's about 50% of the course is uphill as you come to the very end. And I remember when I was running in the race coming up that last part, my legs are burning, my my chest is pounding. All my muscles are aching. And I started to feel like I'm not going to make it. I'm going to have to stop i I'm too tired. I can't go any further. And as we were crossing the bridge that goes over the tumbler Cumberland River, as I was thinking contemplating slowing down or even stopping, quitting out of the race, there was a man who was about twice my age. I was in my 20s He looked like he was 50 started to go right past me. And all the sudden I had a burst of energy. I thought I'm not going to let that old guy beat me to the finish line. When we start to feel spiritually tired, we need to remember that the Christian race is not a sprint, it's a it's a marathon, it requires that endurance. And when we feel like giving up or quitting or giving in, we need to look around at the other brothers and sisters, some of whom have been running for a lot longer than we have. But to remember that we have to continue on to press on. That's one of the reasons why our relationship, our connection to each other is so important. Because when I'm faltering and starting to slow down, I look at a brother who is pressing on.

Conrad Harkrider  30:48
And we build strength, we draw encouragement and strength from one another. We help keep each other accountable. We encourage one another to not quit, don't give up. Because Jesus says the one who endures to the end will be saved. And Hebrews chapter 12, and verse one, it says, Therefore, since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, let us also lay aside every weight, and sin which cleans to us so closely. And let us run with endurance. The race that has said before is looking to Jesus, the founder and perfecter of our faith, continuing to look to Jesus as our example, for faith. Finally, Jesus emphasizes that, that no matter what is going on around us, we must continue to spread the gospel. The gospel, the good news, verse 14, he says, this gospel of the kingdom will be preached in all the world as a witness to all nations, and then the end will come. This gospel is going to be proclaimed throughout the whole world. The end here, again, is not a reference to the end of the world, but rather what was going to happen in their lifetimes, the destruction of Jerusalem, but Jesus is telling them about this catastrophic event, their temple being destroyed, their city is going to be decimated, people will be dispersed, they're going to be hated, they're going to be persecuted. Some of them are going to fall away. And yet he says, The Gospel will continue to spread. No matter what is happening in the world, no matter what's going on, people still need the Lord. The greatest disease that is ever plagued mankind, mankind is the disease of sin. And the only remedy or cure for people is to know Jesus Christ, we've got to keep that front and center. In our minds. Jesus said that we are the light of the world. That light is something that cannot be cannot be hidden, it cannot be taken away, a city that is set on a hill cannot be hidden. So no matter how dark or how strong, the winds are, how difficult or or severe, the storms, that light must continue to shine. Our approach to reaching out to others might be different now, because of some of the circumstances but we can still continue to build relationships, to talk to friends, neighbors, other people, about the Lord. Send them one of the links to our services, ask them questions. What do you think about what's going on right now? What do you think about God? Have you ever read the Bible but continuing to make an effort to talk to others about the Lord, keeping the Lord at the center of everything we do? In our conversations and our relationships, and our goals and aspirations? As Paul said in in Colossians, chapter three, and verse 16, we need to let the word of Christ dwell in our hearts originally. We're going to close this morning with a song and it's an opportunity to respond to God's invitation. If there's something that we can do, to encourage you in your walk, to draw closer to the Lord, to have a more personal or intimate relationship with him or if you need to put on Christ and become a Christian, confessing your sins, repenting and being baptized for the forgiveness of your sins. If there's something that we can do to encourage or help you this morning. Please come down to the front as we stand in seeing
