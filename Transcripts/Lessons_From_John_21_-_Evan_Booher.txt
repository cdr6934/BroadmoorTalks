Evan Booher  00:10
Good to see everybody tonight. Some of you haven't seen in a while. This is the different services we've been having. So it's good to see everybody here. During during the past year, I probably spent the most time studying, or on my own the book of John, have any any other books in the Bible, I just, I'm not sure how many times I read through it. Quite a few. And I was continually impressed with it. So tonight, our lessons going to come from one of those chapters, it's going to come from John 21, that became one of my favorite chapters. So. So anyway, just a little bit of background on the Gospel of John, we probably most of us know that it's different from the other three gospels in some ways. It's has a much more theological, theological focus. And whereas others are a little bit more historical or narrative, and one thing that strikes you when you study, John is just how careful he is about what he chooses to share. And what he chooses to share, it usually has a message behind it, or in some cases, several messages behind it. There's on the surface, a lot of times the language he uses is very simple. But in some ways that simplicity actually leads to a depth. And so it's it's a it's a great book to study. Another unique aspect of John is that it has a distinct provogue section in John one, verses one through 18. And then also there's this epilogue that really is chapter 21. If you look at chapter 20, verses 30, and 31, it sort of sounds as if John is ending the book right here. It says, Now, Jesus did many other signs in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book. But these are written so that you may believe that Jesus the Christ, the Son of God, and not by believing you may have life in his name. If that was the end, probably no one would, would really notice because that it seems like he wraps up there. And honestly, there's a lot of scholarly debate on how then chapter 21 comes about, or why it's included in that way. And why chapter 20, verses 30 and 31, are inserted right here in between the two chapters. And I don't think we can make a definite decision about all of that. But I do think it indicates that there's something important about chapter 21, the way it's set off like this, there's also some interesting things about maybe why chapter 21 is given a little special importance. One, John calls out that this is the third time, at least that he records, the third time that Jesus was revealed to the disciples. So maybe there's some significance there, and that he wanted to get to that special number of three appearances. After the resurrection, it also could be a sort of bookend to the entire Gospel story between Jesus and his disciples, John doesn't tell of the first calling, have Peter and Andrew and James and John, about the other gospels do, and we'll see that that calling is very similar to what happens here. And so to his readers, it might have seemed as the appropriate way to, to wrap it up a fishing sequence and a miraculous catch of fish coming here at the end of Jesus ministry, much like it began. It also could be that chapter 21 serves as a segue into the next chapter of the history of the church and because chapter 21 certainly has an emphasis on Peter, and part of that, as we'll see, is this story of the restoration of Peter, from where we saw him a couple chapters ago, being of denying Jesus to now you know, the readers of John would understand that somehow Peter rebounded from that and became, you know, the leader of the early church. And so, this could be the It sets up how that came about how Peter was fulfilled his mission that

Evan Booher  05:07
Jesus gave him. So regardless of you know how this chapter came to be at the end here and why there's that sort of false ending right before. It's a, it's a beautiful powerful chapter is, hopefully we'll see. So we'll go on and get into the text, we'll look at five points just to give give a little outline, we're going to focus the lesson around five statements that are made in this chapter. And the lessons that we can learn from those five statements that various characters make. So verses one through three. After this, Jesus revealed himself again to the disciples by the Sea of Tiberius, and he revealed himself in this way, assignment, Peter Thomas called the Twin that they know of Cana in Galilee, the sons of Zebedee, and two others, his disciples were together, Simon Peter said to them, I am going fishing, they said to Him, we will go with you, they went out and got into the boat, but that night, they call it nothing. So this, this chapter occurs a couple of weeks after the resurrection. So the, the disciples have had seen Jesus a couple times, but he's not with them. And so in some ways, it's an interesting look into the disciples life apart from Jesus, because we don't, we don't really see much of that anywhere else. For the past three years, as of you know, where this chapter fits. The disciples have been more or less constantly following Jesus, assisting him in his preaching, or teaching and also, at times, being sent out on their own to, to preach on their own. But now, they're back home in Galilee. And even though Jesus is back from the dead, he's not with them all the time, apparently. So they're there on their own. And there's this sort of sense that they don't know what to do. But Peter, he wants to go fishing. Which isn't isn't surprising, knowing him as a fisherman, maybe he was just wanting to go for fun. Or maybe it's that he needs to support his family now that he's he's back home. And so he needs to fish to, for food and to sell it for money. I like just the again, the simplicity of the language here and and how Peter, it fits his personality, he just declares that he is going fishing, it's like he doesn't ask if anybody wants to go fishing. He's just he's going to go regardless. But at least the other ones do, do agree that they want to go with him to just a quick thing, again, we're going to see a lot of different symbolism in this chapter. One thing to note that it's interesting that John includes seven disciples in this list, and seven of them go fishing, which, of course is a significant number. So our first statement is is Peters statement of I'm going fishing. That the lesson that we're going to look at here, comes from verse three, when they went out and got into the boat, but that night, they caught nothing.

Evan Booher  08:37
I think that that has some significance, that they fish, a fish, but come up empty. And again, part of this is right now Jesus is not with them. And Jesus had, you know, told them and other actually back in chapter six, he had said, to not labor for the food that perishes before the food that endures to eternal life. And of course, while there's some practical things that we do have to work, and we have to sustain ourselves, but there's, there's a picture here of this, this emptiness that comes simply from physical pursuits apart from Jesus. And I think we can all relate to that, that our own pursuits like our jobs, our hobbies, whether it's fishing or something else. Those in the end, we come up empty if that's all that we have. And it doesn't necessarily matter that on this trip, the disciples are literally empty, they catch nothing. It's the idea that even if they were successful and had a fantastic catch of fish, apart from Jesus, that that doesn't really matter. So, it reminds me of some other verses. For instance, in Ecclesiastes, the preacher says about our toil and labor, he said As the everything done under the sun is vanity and a striving after wind, what does the worker gain? All his days are full of sorrow in his work is a vexation. Even in the night, his heart does not rest. This also is vanity. Here literally the disciples were out all night, they did not rest at night, like Ecclesiastes said. And just like Louisiana cities, all they have is emptiness or vanity, which are really synonyms. So there's there's an emptiness that comes apart from Jesus. But then there's some really great imagery in verse four. Verse four, just as day was breaking, Jesus stood on the shore. Again, I don't think we can overlook the tiny details here, that John tells us, that the disciples were fishing at night, and caught nothing. And here just as day was breaking, Jesus stood on the shore. The prologue of John says that Jesus was the true light, which enlightens everyone, and he was coming into the world. And now in the epilogue, the disciples are in the dark fishing, catching nothing, their nets are empty. But Jesus comes with the morning light. Other verses that come to mind, the steadfast love the Lord never ceases, but his mercies are new every morning. And Weeping may last for a night, but joy comes in the morning. The disciples here are unsuccessful. During the night, life is empty, in vain, but Jesus comes in the morning. At this point, they don't even know that it's Jesus. But they're, they're about to find out, reading on verse, verse five. Jesus said to them, children, do you have any fish? They answered him, no. He said to them, cast the net on the right side of the boat, and you will find some, so they cast it, and now they were not able to haul it in, because of the quantity of fish. And then that disciple whom Jesus love, therefore said to Peter, it is the Lord. When Simon Peter heard that it was the Lord he put on his outer garment for he was stripped for work, and threw himself into the sea. For an entire night, the disciples had fished, and caught nothing. Now, Jesus, they don't really even know it's Jesus at this point. But a man tells them to try the other side of the boat, which, honestly, they probably tried. I mean, there's nothing special about one side or the other. But when they do that, they immediately catch this enormous, miraculous impossible amount of fish. And what comes next? Our next point, it is the Lord. It's such a great explanation. And John, who we assume is the disciple whom Jesus loved. John is the one that is first to recognize this.

Evan Booher  13:18
He instantly ascribes what he sees this miraculous catch to Jesus. He knows that only Jesus can do something like this. It's such a great reminder that every perfect good and perfect gift comes from the Lord. It is the Lord should be our first response to whenever we are blessed physically, or when we are blessed, spiritually, spiritual, being brought from night to light, or night to morning and darkness to light. That is the Lord working as in this passage. Another thing is, is John, he would remember when he sees this happening, it's it's deja vu all over again, he's replaying what happened the first time when, when they saw Jesus, and so it's, it's quick for him. It's instant that he realizes that this is Jesus, revealing Himself to them. And Simon Peter, of course, being the man of action that he was, he dives in he can't wait to row back to shore he just dives in and swims to Jesus. So what happens next verse say, the other disciples came in the boat. Dragging the net full of fish for they were not far from the land but about 100 yards off. When they got out on land. They saw a charcoal fire in place with fish laid out on it and bread. Jesus said to them, bring some of the fish that you have just caught. Simon Peter went aboard and hauled the net ashore, full of large fish 153 of them. And although there were so many of them, the net was not torn. So Peters already made it to shore. But once others come in, he goes out and helps them bring in the net filled with 153. And I liked the Greek because it says mega fish, large fish. So I mean, it's probably at least two to 300 pounds of fish. Of course, there's a lot of theories about this 153 And what that could mean. And I think it's it's safe to say that it's impossible for us to know today what any special meaning of that would have been, if it did have a symbolic meaning. But just one interesting thing that that I noted is that if you look at the three food miracles in John, John to and John six, and then John 21. Each one, John does give a very specific kind of number involved. In John two, they were six stone water jars, each holding exactly each holding two to three measures of water. And he even specifies that they were used for Jewish purification rites. And chapter six there 12 baskets of leftovers gathered after Jesus fed the 5000. And here in chapter 21, there are 153 large fish caught. I'm not sure if we can conclude anything from that. But it is interesting that each time John uses a specific number to give it give it some credence perhaps. Another key detail here is that John says that although there were so many fish, the net was not broken. This reminds us that Jesus is a step ahead. He provided abundantly for them. But he also provided abundantly for their abundance, he made sure that the net would not break. It's as if he's filled their cup, so their cup is running over. But either the cup this somehow keeps growing to hold that running run off or, or there's a saucer or something to catch the excess. The net that he provides does not break, no matter what he puts into it. So next, we get to my personal favorite part of this chapter. And one of my favorite sayings of Jesus, come and have breakfast.

Evan Booher  17:34
We saw in verse nine, that when Peter gets to shore, and then the others come into, they see a fire with fish laid out on it and bread. And I like to picture that they they see Jesus they're, you know, squatting down, grilling, fish, slicing and toasting the bread seasoning it flipping it. Now I know some commentators take this to be some sort of miraculous thing that he does made it appear. But it's it's much more powerful to think of it as Jesus cooking for his disciples. And it wouldn't be the first time that he the master humbled himself like this. In fact, just a couple weeks earlier, it after the last meal that John recorded Jesus having with his disciples, he got down and wash their feet. This episode of Jesus cooking for them or saying inviting them to come have breakfast. It's even more powerful compared to a parable that Jesus tells in Luke 17. Luke 17, verse seven, he said, well, any one of you who has a servant plowing or keeping sheep say to him when he has come in from the field, come at once and recline at table. Will he not rather say to him prepare supper for me and dress properly and serve me while I eat and drink? And afterward you will eat and drink? Does he thank the servant because he did what he was commanded. So you also, when you have done all that you are commanded, say we are unworthy servants, we have only done what was our duty. Here in John 21. Jesus turns that parable on its head. Jesus shows what Master would cook for His servants when they come in from a night of fishing. It's Jesus, the master chef. And maybe there's another contrast between this passage in Luke 17 week 17 He's saying what what Master would cook for His servants. But in John 15. Again after the feet washing after the last meal that was recorded, Jesus told his disciples that he no longer regarded them as servants but it's free And it might seem unrealistic or counterintuitive for a master to cook for His servants. But we all know plenty of friends who would cook for their friends Come and have breakfast. Those words have even more meaning to them. And fact come used in the sense of God's invitation is such an important concept throughout Scripture. If we think of one of the what's really the second sentence that's recorded in John of Jesus that Jesus says, but it's, it's right there at the beginning. The second thing that he says is come and see to the first two disciples of John that are that are following him. He starts off with that invitation of come. And he finishes the book with another invitation have come. Other passages that if we look at this in the context of this disciples who were probably tired from being out all night fishing, and then fighting to bring in this massive catch of fish, or in Peters case, swimming. But then Jesus says, Come and have breakfast, when that remind them of his earlier saying, if it come to me, all you who are weary and heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Going all the way back to Exodus chapter 24. God told Moses come up to the Lord, you and Aaron, they dab in a by Hugh and 70 of the elders of Israel, and worship the Lord. And they saw the God of Israel and ate and drank. Or what about the great invitation in Isaiah 55? Come, everyone who thirsts come to the waters, and he who has no money come by and eat, come buy wine and milk Without money and without price? Why do you spend your money for that which is not read and your labor for that which does not satisfy? Again, just taking that verse? There's so many parallels here? Come you who have no money or food, the disciples? Didn't they? They were empty before Jesus came. And we had already seen that when he had told them, you know, don't labor for the food that perishes. It's very similar language to hear in Isaiah.

Evan Booher  22:29
From Jesus's own statements earlier in the gospels, he told parables of the wedding feast or the great banquet, where the Masters words were come for everything is now ready. Later in the Gianni corpus, Revelation three, Jesus says, Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears My voice and opens the door, I will come in to him and eat with him. And he with me. So when we think of all of this, those words of Jesus Come and have breakfast. They're just some of the most powerful, powerful words I think he says, that Jesus, God in the flesh, is willing to cook and invite His disciples in. If we look at a few more details in the next couple verses, verses 12 and 1412, through 14, Jesus said them Come and have breakfast. Now, none of the disciples dared ask him, Who are you? They knew it was the Lord. Jesus came and took the bread and gave it to them. And so with the fish, this was now the third time that Jesus was revealed to the disciples after he was raised from the dead. Back in verse 10, Jesus already we know he already had fish that he was cooking, I'm not sure where he got them, but somehow he had fish. But in verse 10, again, John includes these details. And he says that Jesus told them to bring some of the fish that you have just caught. And that that provides another lesson. Jesus invites them to participate. He doesn't need their help. He clearly already has his own source of fish. He already has some that's ready. But he invites His disciples to contribute. In verse 12, the disciples, it says they knew that it was the Lord. I don't want to get into the details of what it means when he says they didn't want to ask or all that. But the point there is that now that they see Jesus, they're eating with him. They know that it is Jesus. Verse 13, note the language that John uses that Jesus took the bread and gave it to them. That's very similar to the formula that the synoptics use for the Lord. supper again that Luke uses for the communion after Jesus's resurrection when he's with Cleopas. And his friend. In that passage, it says he was known to them in the breaking of the bread. Again, very, very similar to what we see here. In Acts 1041. Peter, looking back at maybe this this instance, it hopefully would, I like to think of it as it would have been something in the back of his mind when he says this. Peter says, that Jesus appeared to us who had been chosen by God as witnesses who ate and drank with him after he rose from the dead. So speaking of Peter, he'll be the main subject of our last two points. The fourth point, as we know where this text is going, the fourth statement that we're going to request and that we're going to focus in on is these this question of do you love me. And before we get to the John 21 passage, we have to do a little bit of backstory. Because a couple weeks before this, Peter had denied Jesus. And John 18, will read the account of this to notice a few things.

Evan Booher  26:34
John 18, verse 15, and then Simon Peter followed Jesus, and so did another disciple. Since that disciple was known to the high priest, he entered with Jesus into the court of the high priest, but Peter stood outside at the door. So the other disciple who was known to the high priest went out and spoke to the servant girl who kept on to the door, and brought Peter in. The servant girl at the door, said to Peter, you also are not one of this man's disciples are you? He said, I am not. Now the servants and officers had made a charcoal fire because it was cold, and they were standing in warming themselves. Peter also was with him, standing and warming himself. Then in verse 25. Now Simon Peter was standing in warming himself. So they said to him, you also are not one of his disciples are you? He denied it and said, I am not one of the servants of the high priest, a relative of the man whose ear Peter had cut off ask, did I not see you in the garden with him? Peter again denied it, and it wants a rooster crowed? We know this story so well, but it still should be jarring that Peter, one of Jesus's closest friends and most prominent disciples that he denies even knowing Jesus, you're not just to the officers who were there at the mic could understand that. But initially, he denies even knowing him to a servant girl. Verse 18, is the one verses I want to want to show how it connects to here in chapter 21, verse 18, again, sometimes John gives these details that would seem seem pointless, on first first glance, but he says the servants and officers had made a charcoal fire, because it was cold. But when we notice that this word only comes up one other time in the whole Bible, even including the Greek Old Testament, and that one other time is in chapter 20, Chapter 21, verse nine, when the disciples come to land, and they see Jesus and the charcoal fire. So again, this is a picture, we have to envision. We see Peter who had swum to shore, climbing out of the the waves crawling up onto the shore. I'm sure he's cold, because it's an early spring morning. And he sees this charcoal fire. If it were a movie, I could imagine that the camera would focus on the charcoal fire here on the beach, and then fade over to the charcoal fire in the high priests courtyard for a flashback scene. If they Boyd were here, I'd ask him if there's some sort of term for that, but I can I can picture what it would what it would look like. Because I think that's what John is intending us to think of to make this connection that Peter sees the charcoal fire and you can, you can feel him and Jesus, both seeing it and knowing Jesus knows what happened that night. Peter knows what happened that night. And what is What does Jesus say to him? Come and have breakfast. Jesus is not going to deny that he knows Peter, he's not going to deny Peter a place at the table or place among his disciples. He invites him back with Come and have breakfast.

Evan Booher  30:26
So I love the detail about the charcoal fire, because many scholars have noticed that these three questions that Jesus asks in chapter 21, that we're about to see, parallel those three denials, but I feel that charcoal fire detail makes it explicit connection that John intended. So looking at verses 15, through 17, when they had finished breakfast, Jesus said to Simon Peter, Simon, son of John, do you love Me more than these? He said to him, Yes, Lord, you know that I love you. He said to him, Feed my lambs. He said to him a second time, Simon, son of John, do you love me? He said to him, Yes, Lord, you know that I love you. He said to him, 10, my sheep. He said to him the third time, Simon, son of John, do you love me? Peter was grieved, because he said to him the third time, Do you love me? And he said to him, Lord, you know everything, you know that I love you. Jesus said to feed my sheep. I like to imagine here that it's just Jesus and Peter sitting at the fire after they had finished breakfast, as it says, because it's a very personal one on one conversation. So maybe the other disciples went to clean the fish or something like that. And the parallelism here, just like Peter was asked three times, if he knew Jesus, Jesus asks him three times if Peter loves them. And maybe they had already. Maybe they had already talked about this, because we know Peter and Jesus have met a couple times, at least after the resurrection. But this is clearly John sets up this conversation as the time where they're going to resolve what had happened, resolve Peters denial, and enable him to move forward. Each time that Jesus asks Peter, do you love me has to be painful to Peter tang of this conscience and reminding him of when he was too afraid to stand up for Jesus. But I think it's important to notice that Jesus is more concerned about the present and about the future than about the past. He doesn't even specifically mention Peters denials. He doesn't confront him or rebuke him for for those denials. Instead, he asks him right now in the present, do you love me? And will you continue to love me? I think if we're being honest, and we picture Jesus asking us these questions of do we love him, at least my first thought would be to the past, and to all of these things I've done and what times where Jesus could say, You clearly don't love me because you've done this and you've done this and not done this. And but but that's, that's where that's where we go, but Jesus, he's, he's in the present, and he's looking to the future because he tells, he tells Peter that after Peter confesses his love, he tells them to feed my lambs in 10 my sheet another thing we see here is that Jesus lives out the type of forgiveness that He preached about. We see some parallels here to the parable of the prodigal son, where the father invited the son back and killed the fattened calf for him, despite all that he had done. Here, Peter, I mean, Jesus invites Peter back and we have that same concept of a meal, he invites him to come in have breakfast, not dwelling and focusing on what Peter had done a few weeks ago. And we also see, we're reminded of another time when Peter asked Jesus, how many times should I forgive my brother, up to seven times? And Jesus says, Not seven, but 70 times seven. Peter had personally sinned against Jesus by denying him. It wasn't just a moral he lied. And so he said, but it's it was a personal thing toward his friend. He denied even knowing Him. And so we see Jesus for giving a slight or an An assault like that, in need, forgives it, you know three times it's this abundant

Evan Booher  35:05
forgiveness one thing that we want to I want to address real quickly for these is verses because a lot of you have probably heard that Jesus uses, or John uses different words for love in the section. And the way I've commonly heard it explained. He uses the first two times Jesus asks, Simon if he a Gobbo loves Jesus, and Simon replies all three times that he just filo loves Jesus. And so the way this explanation typically goes, is that a Gobbo is this supreme self sacrificing type of love. And then that's what Jesus is wanting. And Peter is not willing to to give that or he's unable, maybe it's from humility, some some people say, but he's unable or unwilling to give that full 100% Love. And then the third time Jesus comes down to his level and lowers his question to ask him a fee. Philo loves Jesus. But in context, I don't, I don't think that that type of interpretation makes sense, or fits with fits with the rest of the point of the chapter. So first, we just have to see that there's a lot of different synonyms used throughout this chapter. A couple ones in these verses are that John uses different words for feeding and tending the sheep and uses lambs in one case and sheep. In the other case, verse 17, he uses different words for know that are, you know, clearly synonymous. And earlier in the chapter, he uses different words for fish, he uses different words for the boat that they're in. So there certainly is a possibility that he is just varying it up for the sake of varying it up. But knowing how careful John is like, for instance, with the charcoal fire, I tend to think there's something something more than that. So a possibility that I want to suggest. For just a little bit of background, the, the Septuagint, the New Testament don't necessarily conform to the broader Greek literature, when it comes to their uses of love. The Septuagint and New Testament use agave for almost all instances, it's by far the most common, commonly used word, but the opposite was actually true in the broader literature, that filat o or even another word called arrows were used much more than a Gopa was. And another thing just to be aware of, is that in ancient Greek literature, agave didn't always have this, you know, perfect, self sacrificing type of love. It was frequently just used interchangeably with the other words. And so so on its own, it's not necessarily this supreme love, even though it's it's typically used that way in the Bible. So that being said, John uses the left, oh, this more friendly love, we often hear it called or affectionate love. He uses flow more than any other book in the Bible. And in some ways, he uses it that do not seem to be inferior to a Gobbo. For instance, in John Five, Verse 20, he says, The Father loves the Son,

Evan Booher  38:56
using the word for John 1527, he says, The Father himself loves you, the disciples, because you have loved me, and I believed that I came from God. So I don't think anyone would say that the Father's love is inferior, if anything, it's just, he's using this more familial or, you know, casual friendship, sort of love to convey a father for for his, his children. So it's not that it's necessarily inferior. And another aspect is that fill out Oh here is connected to the word for friend. It does mean a sort of friendly love, a love that you would have for your friends. And friend in English, modern English is a very diluted word often when we use it for anything from people that we've met once or twice to, you know, our best friends. But in Greek, specifically in a film softgel type of context, friend had a much deeper meaning. And many of the philosophers spoke of like an ideal friendship. That is, it should remind us of some some things of Jesus to, for instance, the quote from Aristotle was saying that the virtuous man's conduct is often guided by the interest of his friends in of his country, and he will, if necessary, laid, I lay down his life in their behalf. And we should all think of what passage comes to mind when laying down your life for your friends. Earlier in John chapter 15, Greater love has no one than this, that someone lays down his life for his friends, you are my friends, if you do it, I command you no longer do I call you servants. This is a passage we mentioned earlier, but I have called you friends. Jesus sets out in this passage that similar to the broader Greek philosophical idea of friendship being something very important and very serious, he lays out that he will lay down his life for his friends. It's not just an ideal to him, it's something that he would actually follow through it as well. So I feel that here and chapter in chapter 21, what Peter is really getting to and then with Jesus's third question, when he uses the term Philo, it has this, I think we have to connect it to John 15. that Peter is saying that finally he is going to be a faithful friend to Jesus, unlike the times, just at the denial where three times he denied even knowing Jesus, now he's saying that he will be faithful to Jesus to the point of death. It makes sense in context, because if we look at verses 18, and 19, it's exactly what Jesus goes on to speak about. He says, Truly, truly, I say to you, when you were young, you used to dress yourself and walk wherever you wanted. But when you are old, you will stretch out your hands, and another will dress you and carry you where you do not want to go. This he said, to show by what kind of death, he was to glorify God. And after saying this, he said to him, Follow me. Even just taking that very last verse, follow me the last time Jesus said that to Peter, again, at the meal, the Passover meal at the Last Supper, Peter says that he will follow he asked Jesus, where are you going? And Jesus said, where I'm going, you cannot follow me now. But you will follow afterward word, why can I not follow you now Peter said, I will lay down my life for you. And Jesus said, Will you wait on your life? No, you will deny me three times. So they're clearly talking here, Jesus is saying Peter will follow him to death. And so just in that context of Peter laying down his life for Jesus, I have to think of the passage in chapter 15 of the Greater love has no one than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends. So our final point comes from the last couple verses, verses 20. Through 23.

Evan Booher  43:44
Peter turned and saw the disciple whom Jesus loved following them, the one who also had leaned back against him during the supper, and said, Lord, who is it, it is going to betray you? When Peter saw him, he said to Jesus, Lord, what about this man? Jesus said to him, if it is my will, that he remained until I come? What is that to you? You follow me. It's been a big day for Peter. He started out just thinking he was going to go on a casual fishing trip. But then Jesus appears, and he has to confront the denial that he had of Jesus. And then he hears that he is going to be, you know, killed at some point for Jesus. And so we understand when he's wondering, well, you know why and he sees John and he's curious what's what about him? Is he gonna die too? And but we can learn from Jesus response, that it's simple and it's simply what is it to you? What does it matter? Too often, we like Peter spend too much time worrying about other people. and wondering, either why some people may have it easy and we don't, or wondering about, you know, if these people are, are following God correctly or if they are going to go to heaven or hell or judging people and all these sorts of things, concerned with other people and not concerned with ourselves, and Jesus is telling Peter, that His will is going to be done it and it doesn't matter. What happens to John Peters responsibility is to follow Jesus. So, I'm sorry, we had to rush through a couple of a couple of my notes. But I want to want to wrap up and hope that we've we've seen some valuable lessons, I hope that we've seen from the weekend remember from I am going fishing that our labors for the food that perishes in the end, they leave us empty, and they can't fulfill. But we see that it is the Lord reminds us that Jesus brings light and blessings and purpose and fulfillment. Jesus invites everyone to come and have breakfast with him, which itself is such an extraordinary thought that his IQ coincides with His purpose for everything that the creation, his sacrifice His resurrection, is that he wants us to be His friends, and he wants to share his food and blessings with us. He wants to come in eat with us. But he does ask us Do we love Him? Are we willing to follow him? But just like with Peter embedded in that question, his his amazing mercy and forgiveness, that He gives us however many chances we need, the after our denials, he still accepts our confessions of love to Him. And He commands us to follow Him, to love Him with the true love of a friend, to give our lives for him if necessary. And finally, after all of this, he says what is it to you? When we questioned his will? When we get too concerned about about other people and other things that are occurring in the world? We need to remember what what is it to you, you follow me? This what Jesus told told here. So, I hope, hope those lessons have been been helpful, and that we can take that and think on it. Sorry, I went over a little bit. I think the the invitation of Jesus speaks for itself there that he does invite everyone to come. And so if anyone needs to come at this point, we'll stand and sing our closing song
