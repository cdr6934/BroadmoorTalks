If you have your Bibles and we'll be opening up to Matthew, the fifth chapter.

Conrad Harkrider  00:18
Matthew chapter five, it's good to see each of you here tonight, look forward to being able to study some more of God's Word together. A few years ago, I received a letter in the mail, telling me that I had been summoned for jury duty. And so I reported down to the courthouse in downtown Nashville to fulfill my civic duty. We were brought into a room that had about 60 of us. And then eventually we were led into a courtroom where a judge and a couple of attorneys were waiting for us. And they began to call numbers to fill the 12 seats in the jury box. And fortunately, my number was one of the first to be called, we got up into the the box and sat down. And the judge gave us a few details about the case. And then they asked us to raise our right hand and to repeat, or they asked us a question that went something like this. Do you solemnly swear or affirm that you will answer truthfully, all the questions asked of you as a prospective juror, so help you God? And we answered, Yes. And after answering a few questions from one of the attorneys, I was not selected and was allowed to leave. That process of trying to find jurors for a case is called the voir, dear. It's a French phrase, which means to speak the truth. Telling the truth is critically important in a courtroom, because that's the only way you can have a fair case. If you were to pick a jury that was not telling the truth. When asked those questions, you might have someone who is biased, someone who does not like the defendant, or perhaps someone who is close to the defendant, they're related to them, and you could have an unfair trial. Speaking things that are true is not just however, for a courtroom. As Christians, it should be a part of our everyday live words matter. The things that we say, matter. This was something that Jay Jesus greatly emphasized in his teaching. And one of his most well known sermons in Matthew chapter five in the Sermon on the Mount, when he said, Let your yes be yes. So I'd like for us to think about what that means tonight for just a few moments speaking the truth and letting your yes be yes. Read with me in Matthew chapter five, beginning in verse 33. It says, again, you have heard that it was said to those of old You shall not swear falsely, but shall perform your oath to the Lord. But I say to you, do not swear at all, neither by heaven, for it is God's throne, nor by earth, for it is his footstool, nor by Jerusalem, for it is the city of the great king, nor shall you swear by your head, because you cannot make one hair white or black. But let your Yes be Yes. And your No, no, for whatever is more than these is from the evil one. We live in a world where it is increasingly difficult to tell who is telling the truth. There are situations that come up all the time, where one person is being accused of something, they're being charged with something that they have abused another person. And the the the charges that are being brought the the person is absolutely certain that these things happened. And on the flip side, the one who's being accused is adamant that nothing like this ever occurred. Someone is not telling the truth.

Conrad Harkrider  04:38
One researcher from the University of Massachusetts did a study on 250 people and he found that when talking with a stranger for 10 minutes 60% of them told a lie. Whether it was agreeing with someone when you don't actually agree, or sometimes it was Something more extreme like claiming to be in a rock band, when you actually weren't nearly two thirds 60% of the participants were found stretching the truth. Here in Matthew five, Jesus begins this section in verse 33, with the phrase you have heard, you have heard, and that's found six times in this chapter in verse 21. And verse 2731 3338, and 43. Jesus is not quoting from the scriptures when he says, You have heard, as he often did when he would say it is written. But instead he's highlighting some of the common teachings of their day, things that were delivered by the experts of the law, the scribes, and the Pharisees. And although what they said, seemed to be consistent with the law, their interpretation, and their application was deeply flawed. So look at what they said, verse 33, You have heard that it was said to those of old, you shall not swear falsely, but shall perform your oaths to the Lord on the surface, it seems pretty consistent, pretty straightforward, with what the law of Moses said in Leviticus chapter 19. In verse 12, Moses said, You shall not swear by my Name falsely, so too, and so profane the name of your God, I am the Lord. In Numbers chapter 30. In verse two, if a man vows a vow to the Lord or swears an oath, to bind himself by a pledge, he shall not break his word, he shall do according to all that proceeds out of his mouth. Notice the emphasis in these verses is not whether or not a person swears or makes a vow. But instead, God's people were not to swear falsely, they were not to break their word. They were to be honest, and truthful, in their dealings, if they vowed something to the Lord, if they made a commitment to another person, than they were to keep their word, they were to be faithful in what they said. In fact, there were some instances where God's people were required to make vows in the Old Testament. So what is Jesus trying to refute here, we get a sense of what's going on. If you look at verses 34, through 36, he lists several things here that they should not take an oath, or swear by. He says in verse 34, that they should not swear by heaven for it as God's throne. They shouldn't swear by the earth, for it is his footstool, not by Jerusalem, because it's the city of the great king, and not by your head, because you cannot make one hair white, or black. What is the what is his point in listing out all of these things? Well, in all of these examples here, he connects them back to to God, they are related to the Lord. And what he's saying is that God has the rule, he has the authority over all of these things. He rules over heaven, it is his throne, he rolls over Earth, it is his footstool, all of these things belong to God. What the scribes and Pharisees had done was to create this system of loopholes with all of these exception clauses where they were allowed to break their word. What they said was that unless God's name was used in an oath, or when one was swearing, then the oath was not binding. And Jesus's point is that if you swear by heaven, or you swear by the Lord, Heaven belongs to the Lord. It is the Lord's throne, you are still obligated to perform your vow. When we were kids growing up, and people would borrow things from each other. Sometimes you would borrow a video game and you'd say, the person would say, Okay, well

Conrad Harkrider  09:33
bring it back tomorrow, and the next day would come and you didn't bring it back. And they'd say, Where's my video game? And you'd say, well, I didn't promise. And they'd say, okay, promise to bring it tomorrow, you say, I promise. And the next game day comes around, and you come back and you don't have the video in a good game. And he says, Where's my video game you promised? And you would say, Well, I promise but my fingers were crossed. And so there was There's all these rules and exceptions and ways out. And that's kind of what was going on here. They had come up with this system to be able to get out of what they had committed to do. And Jesus makes this point clear in Matthew chapter 23 And verse 16. He says, Woe to you blind guides who say if anyone swears by the temple it is nothing. But if anyone swears by the gold of the temple, he is bound by his own, You blind fools, which is greater the gold of the temple that has made the gold or the temple that has made the gold sacred. And you say, If anyone swears by the altar, it is nothing but if anyone swears by the gift that is on the altar, he is bound by his oath, you blind men, for which is greater the gift, or the altar that makes the gift sacred. So whoever swears by the altar swears by it and buy everything on it, and whoever swears by the temple swears by it, and by him who dwells in it, and whoever swears by Heaven swears by the throne of God, and by Him who sits on it, Jesus points out that their logic didn't even make sense. They were swearing by the gold of the temple because they thought that that was somehow more significant or greater. And Jesus says that it's not the gold that's special here. It's the temple itself where God dwells. It's not the gift on the altar. It's the altar itself. And so in other words, he says that if you swear by Heaven, you're swearing by the throat of God, you had better take it seriously. So Jesus is not saying that it's wrong to take an oath or to swear. He's saying that if you do make an oath or swear, you should keep your vow you should your intention should be to follow through with what you've said. Jesus Himself, took an oath when, when testifying before the Sanhedrin, he was asked if he was the Christ, and he was charged and put under oath. Also, Paul, on several occasions made statements like he was in a quote, a courtroom and Romans chapter one and verse nine, Paul said, For God is my witness whom I serve with my spirit and the gospel of his son. I mentioned you in my prayers. So it's not wrong for a Christian to make a vow or a promise as we do when we commit ourselves in marriage, but rather the focus is on do we hold to those things? Are we faithful and true to our words? Look at verse 37, Jesus says, but let your Yes be Yes. And your No, no. I'd like for for us to think the rest of our time spend the rest of our time thinking about what that means. And I'll give you four applications about our yes being Yes. First of all, our Yes, is yes, when we speak with integrity, speaking with integrity, integrity means that our words are they're honest. They're true. We can be trusted and verified, when your yes means yes. And your No means no. People don't wonder whether or not what you said is actually true, or it's actually going to take place, we should have a reputation, we should be known as people of high moral character. What is the purpose of a promise or an oath? Why is that necessary? Well, it's not for the benefit of the person speaking,

Conrad Harkrider  13:47
an oath is for those who are listening. It's to give them greater assurance that what is being said, is accurate and true. So whether or not we make the oath or the promise, we are still bound by what comes out of our mouth. It's not only binding, if we add some addendum or something on top of what we've said, can you imagine living in a world where people never lied? Where there was no, no falsehood, no one deceiving or saying things that weren't true, there would be no need for Oaths or for swearing there would be no need for contracts or for rental agreements, two people could just shake hands, and that would be sufficient. Our speech should be honorable. It should be honorable, in the big things, when we are making lofty or very high statements. Someone goes in to apply for a job and they're asked some serious questions. Did you graduate from high school? Do you have a degree? Do you have any kind of criminal History. Those are big questions, and they should have serious truthful answers. But we should also be honest and true in small things, things that are seemingly insignificant. Did you? Have you seen that movie? Or have you ever been to this place? It doesn't really make a difference one way or another? How we answer that question. But sometimes there's a temptation to appear a certain way for have to have others view us. In a certain light, we have to have the courage to say what's right, regardless of what others think or say about us. Speaking with integrity means that we speak the truth. When we're talking to those who are in authority, a teacher or a parent or a grandparent. Someone asks, did you eat all of your lunch? Who spilled this water? Did you pick up your shoes off of the floor? Trust in relationships is so important. And that starts with being able to relay and speak the truth. What about with a police officer? One time I got pulled over. And the police officer, the first question that he asked me was, did you know that the speed limit was 55 miles an hour? And I was thinking to myself, are you going to give me a ticket? If I answer yes to that question. But our answers should not be contingent on am I going to get in trouble? Is this going to cost me some money? Are there going to be consequences? We should be honest, in our words, regardless of the outcome. In Psalm chapter 15, in verse one, David speaks about the man who will dwell in God's presence. Who is it that God will have come to dwell in His holy hill? And he says in verse two, it's He who walks blamelessly, and does what is right, and speaks truth in his heart, the emphasis on saying and speaking the things that are true. And then in verse four, David says, in whose eyes a vile person is despise, but who honors those who fear the Lord.

Conrad Harkrider  17:39
I have the wrong verse there. I'm looking for Psalm 15. Let me find that real quick.

Conrad Harkrider  18:02
Psalm 15, in verse four, in whose eyes a vile person is despised, but he honors those who fear the Lord, He who swears to his own hurt, and does not change, I left off the last part of that, the one who swears to his own hurt. What does it mean to swear to your own hurt? Imagine, you have a fence that's between you and your neighbor's property. And the fence is starting to, to fall down and your neighbor offers to make the repairs and pay for the cost. And you say, well, I'll split the cost with you. Well, the, the neighbor goes ahead and he does the job and the bill comes back and it's much higher than you were expecting. In fact, it's a lot higher than what you were planning. Are you still obligated to share and that expense? David speaks of a person who keeps their word, regardless of if it requires some type of hurt or sacrifice, speaking with integrity, even when it's not always the easiest thing. Also, when you're yes means yes, it means that we speak with sincerity, that our words are sincere. First Peter chapter one. And verse 22, says having purified your souls by your obedience to the truth, for a sincere brotherly love, love one another earnestly from a pure heart. Peter says that our our relationships, our love, our affection for one another should be pure, it should be sincere, it should come from the heart, are the words that we speak are they free of pretense and deceit? Do they come from genuine fear? feelings? Or do we allow attitudes of jealousy and envy to creep into our thoughts? In our minds? We sometimes say things like, well, it was nice to meet you. Or I'm, I'm glad you came. But on the inside, we're thinking to ourselves, I can't stand that person. Or I'm glad they're finally gone. And that often happens, don't we do that in the south, we call that southern hospitality, we kind of smile and we nod our heads like everything is great. And then when the person is not around, then that's when we start to say, Well, we really think about them. Speaking with sincerity, means that we are careful with flattery. In Matthew chapter 22, and verse 16, the Pharisees came to Jesus to ask him a question. And you remember how they approached him? In that setting? They said, Teacher, we know that you are true, that you teach the way of God truthfully, you don't care about anyone's opinion. And they're lavishing on all of this praise to the Lord. But what was their intent? What was their motive, they were trying to trick him, they were trying to trip him up, they were trying to trap him. In his words, they're getting ready to ask him about taxes. And if it was okay to pay taxes to Caesar, they were looking for something that they could accuse him with. Our words should not just be used to make someone feel good. Because it sounds nice, because we like the reaction that we get from them. It should come from a heart of sincerity. And in order to have something sincere to say about other people, sometimes that requires us to change our attitude, to literally change how we feel about them to change how we think about that person. It's difficult to have something sincere to say when my mind is full of bitterness, jealousy, thinking about all the wrongs, that that person is committed, we need to change the way we think. What about sincerity when speaking with our children? Let's say that, hypothetically, I'm working on my computer over here, and one of the kids comes up and says, Daddy, I want to show you something. Okay, just a minute. 60 seconds later, Daddy, I want to show you something. It's been a minute. Okay, go ahead. Daddy, did you see that? Yeah. Wow. That was great. And the whole time we haven't looked up, we haven't paid any attention.

Conrad Harkrider  22:56
Are we being sincere? In our words? It's so easy just to tell them something, get them moving along. But the the truthfulness, the sincerity is lacking. It's better to take a moment to address them to give them our attention. And then to come back to what we're doing. And this is all a part of our Yes, being Yes. And our no being No. Which leads to our next point, which is to speak carefully. Our Yes, being yes means that we need to speak carefully in Matthew chapter 12 And verse 36. It says, I tell you on the Day of Judgment, people will give account for every careless word they speak. The Bible says that God is going to judge us for the words that we speak the things that come out of our mouths. And so we need to pause we need to think about the things that we say we need to consider before we speak. Proverbs says that in the multitude of words, sin is not lacking, but he who restrains his lips, is why is wise proverbs 10 And verse 19. And Ecclesiastes says that it's better to not vow than to make a vow and not pay Ecclesiastes five and verse five. Lying and dishonesty often occur when we have said too much. We have painted ourselves into a corner. And now we are trying to get ourselves out of a jam. It's better to refrain and just to keep ourselves from committing to too much. We need to be careful. In our words, you remember what happened to Jeff, Judges chapter 11. He said to the Lord that if the Lord would give him victory over his enemies, then he would offer a sacrifice out of The first thing that came out of his house, he would offer it to the Lord. Of course, he was thinking about all of the livestock and the animals that would be rushing out to greet him when he returned. But after the Lord gave him his victory, and he returned back to his house, the first thing that came out was not an animal, but his daughter, his only child came out to greet him. We can get caught. And in trouble when we make a statement too quickly, we over commit ourselves. We say things like, Well, I'm planning on B being there, or I should be able to help when in reality, we're double or triple booked, and there's no way we're going to be able to make it. Or what about the phrase something generic, like, let us know if there's anything we can do to help? Anything you can do to help? The mortgage is not paid off. The grass needs to be mowed. The garage is a mess. The kids have practice the laundry is piled higher than a mountain. There's nothing for dinner and the car needs an oil change. You said anything? Right? Wouldn't it be better instead of being generic to say, let us bring you some food next Tuesday? Or what if I come over on Friday afternoon, and help you being specific helps people to know that we're not just saying something, let me know if I can do anything or we're here if you need us. But rather that we have been careful and thoughtful with our words, and that we are being genuine and true with our speech. Finally, for our Yes, being yes, we need to speak with humility. Speaking with humility, First Peter, chapter five. And verse five says that all of us should be

Conrad Harkrider  27:07
clothed with humility. Speaking with humility means that we avoid things like exaggeration, saying something like I've been to this restaurant 1000 times, or we go to the beach two or three times a year, every year, we never miss, or our kids never miss an assignment at school, they always turn their work in on time. Those things may seem harmless, but really, it's just another form of of bragging, of promoting ourselves of saying something that is higher than then what is true. And so instead, God's people should be those who are not trying to promote themselves, talk about their own accomplishments and what we've done, but instead showing interest in others, looking for ways to, to build up to encourage, to help other people to speak with humility. Children are known for being honest. They ask a child, how does my shirt look? Or what do you think of my hair, you are likely to get an honest answer. They will tell you what they're thinking. But there's a lot that we can learn from children. They don't try to cloud their words and some type of ulterior motive. They don't have some type of back end idea or purpose of why they're saying something. They just speak what's on their heart. They say how things truly are. And Jesus said, If we want to enter into His kingdom, we must become like, little children. I think that's part of that is removing all of this extra stuff from our speech. And being able to speak in a way where our yes does mean yes. And our No means no. We're going to close tonight with a song it's an opportunity to encourage any who are here that needs to respond to the Lord's invitation if there's something that we can do to help you to encourage you, in your walk with Christ or if you need to need to commit your life to Christ and become a Christian, that we're ready and we're looking, looking forward to helping you with whatever need you might have. Please come down to the front as we stand in scene
