Good morning. It's good to see everyone here today, certainly good that we have an opportunity to gather together to worship our God, it's always a blessing that we have that chance. So I'm glad that you're here to worship with me and I appreciate you very much. You know, every cup has a limit, probably know that that's why they come in different sizes and, and you can fill a cup up and you can get what we call, get it to the brim, you know, you can get it so high, where it almost curves a little bit right at that top, there's

Jeremy Sweets  00:48
not a single drop more that could be put into that cup without it overflowing. And so sometimes if you're pouring a drink, and you're not paying attention, you can pour it so that it overflows, it comes out over the top. In fact, Azure when he's in the bathtub, that's his favorite thing to do to get a cup. And as the water's coming down, he lets it just overflow. And he dumps it out. And he lets it overflow. And I think that's many, many kids like to do that there's something to that idea of over flowing. Well, when we look in Scripture, we see a picture of overflowing as well, in Colossians, chapter two, verses six and seven Colossians, two, six, and seven. There we see an overflowing of thankfulness. Notice what it says in verse six. Therefore, as you receive Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk in him, rooted and built up in him and established in the faith, just as you were taught, a bounding in thanksgiving, a couple different translations with that the New American Standard Version says, overflowing with gratitude. I believe it's the NET Bible it says overflowing with thankfulness overflowing with thankfulness. We see this picture of Christians that they are to be a thankful people and not meeting the bare minimum or if they're asked, Can you think of something you're thankful for? They think, well, maybe I'm thankful for that. It's not the picture, but one of an overflowing of thankfulness. Let me establish a little bit of the context here. As we get into this passage in Colossians, chapter two. And chapter one, Paul establishes the fact that all sufficiency in magnificent, magnificent sense, I'm not going to try to go back and say that, again, is found in Christ. Christ that says is the image of the invisible God, He is the Creator, the Sustainer, the head of the church, he is the beginning. He is the first one resurrected, and he is preeminent in all things, there is no one that excels Christ or goes beyond Christ. And so Paul is teaching the the Colossians there and teaching us today that that Christ is all you need. You don't need Christ plus something, you don't need Christ and something else. It's not as if we're unlocking all these magical secrets. But instead, we need Christ and He is all sufficient. In Colossians, two, verses six and seven, the passage that we look at here, this introduces kind of the heart of the letter where Paul is going to address some warnings there for the caution, Christians there. So in the rest of chapter two, he warns the Christians against being taken captive by human philosophy. He warns the Christians that they would not disqualify themselves by saying something more than Christ as needed something like observance of days, or dietary restrictions, or even an asceticism of practicing a bare minimum or practicing in such a way that you go without to an extreme. So do not be disqualified in that way. But instead, you've been baptized into Christ, you've been raised to walk in newness of life, and that is what you need to be a Christian. That's what makes you a Christian. So this, these couple of verses here, introduce that thought and notice how he does that. First of all, he says, Therefore, as you received Christ, Jesus the Lord, that is a decision that we make when we become a Christian, we receive Christ, we receive Christ as the Lord of our lives, and so we make a commitment to him. And we receive him in such a way that we honor him with our lives, and we follow after Him and obey Him. We notice the text says Therefore, as you have or as you receive Christ, Jesus the Lord, so walk in him. When we receive Christ, that's not a one time situation. That's not a single day commitment or a one time commitment, but is a commitment to walk continually in whom. And so just as you received him, so walk, continue to walk in him. But notice that what else he says, he says, rooted and built up in him, rooted and built up the cloth and Christians were to be rooted. When I think of roots, I think about something that goes down. If you have a plant or a tree that is firmly rooted, the roots go down into the ground and give that that planter tree stability. It's not going to be moved, it is rooted. But it's also that rootedness that helps it to grow up with the roots firmly in the ground, it grows up and can be built up. And so it is for those that are Christians, we are to be rooted in Christ to have a stability in Christ that goes down so that we will not be moved. But that allows us to grow, that allows us to spring forth and to be built up and notice it says in him in Christ Jesus. Not only that, but we are to be established in the faith, the stability that we can find and correct in Christ should help us to be established in the faith, to be rooted to find stability in Christ. And so we see that there is nothing new to learn. Yes, we can learn more about Christ in that sense, but there's no there's no secret levels that we unlock. You know, some religions say that, here's a you know, something initially, but once you get to this level, then you'll unlock the secrets here. And then you advanced to another level and you'll unlock the secrets. That's not the way Christianity is we are to be established in the faith, the same faith that we were taught, there's no new unlocking levels by a secret club. We are to be established in the faith. And then he comes to this last phrase, of bounding in thanksgiving. What we have in Christ, the fullness that we have in Christ is a cause of celebration is a cause for rejoicing. It is a cause for Thanksgiving in such a way that we are to overflow. Just like we are that cup we overflow with thanksgiving. We have everything we need and Christ. Oh happy to Hey, what a great thoughts. And so he says, Be thankful and be overflowing with thanksgiving. I'd like to consider a few points this morning as we talk about overflowing with thankfulness. The first one I want to consider is that we have an abundance of blessings and abundance of blessings. God is called the gracious giver in Scripture and depicted as one that gives and he not only gives, but he gives abundantly. In James one in verse 17. It says that every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, coming down from the Father of lights. God is a giver, a generous giver, a giver in abundance. In a song that we often sing, we say Praise God from whom all blessings flow. Praise Him. All creatures here below. Yes, we understand that God gives us all things and it gives us them in abundance. Notice if you would, Deuteronomy chapter 30. In verse nine, there are talks about the abundant blessings of the covenant. There are curses and there are blesses blessings and those that obey it says, The Lord your God will make you abundantly prosperous, and all the work of your hand, in the fruit of your womb and in the fruit of your cattle and in the fruit of your ground. God gives and he gives abundantly and that covenant relationship was one that could grant bring great blessings for the people. That's not surprising for when we see God. He is a God of abundant love, abundant generosity. We see often in that same covenant language. It says in Exodus 34, in verse six, for example, the Lord is God merciful and gracious, slow to anger and abounding and steadfast love and faithfulness. God is bubbling over in his head Character spilling over in his character. He is not one that is minimally loving, or loving just a little bit, but he abounds in his steadfast love. And so we see the the blessings to be found in God. Just as he abundantly blessed them and Deuteronomy we see that God has abundantly blessed us today. You know, when we think about Thanksgiving, that's a fitting image, we often have a cornucopia, don't we, and it's spilling out over with all the food. And even if this was not a regular holiday for you, you probably had some food didn't you? spilling out over? We have plenty here. And we need to be thankful for the plenty that we had. Well, let me also suggest that we should not only consider our abundance of blessings in physical terms, yes, we need to be thankful for our physical blessings. But that's not all there is to having abundance. In Luke 12, in verse 15, there says, take care and be on your guard against all covetousness. For one's life does not consist in the abundance of his possessions. Why is not about things. And as we experience a holiday of Thanksgiving, we lead into a holiday, of gifting. And in the bad sense of that it can be consumerism, and just thinking about what I give, that shouldn't be what we think about. But that's where things can lead can lead. And we need to realize that our life does not consist in things. That's not where life is. But instead, we found that life is found in Christ. Our True life is found in Christ. In John chapter 10 And verse 10. It says that Jesus, or Jesus said that He came that they may have life and have it abundantly. He's not talking about have life in things we already know life doesn't consistent things. We have life in Christ. And there is an abundance of life to be found in Christ. That is what he wants for us. And Ephesians one another passage that talks about our spiritual blessings that we have, in verse seven. In Him, we have redemption through his blood, the forgiveness of our trespasses, we have forgiveness in Christ. But notice how it explains that or talks about the forgiveness that we have in Christ, according to the riches of His grace, which He lavished upon us in all wisdom and insights. We have riches in Christ, the riches of His grace, His grace is overflowing and it comes to us. And notice how he talks about that. He says that he lavishes it upon us. If a boy becomes a man or with a girl, he's going to lavish her with love and attention.

Jeremy Sweets  13:03
Maybe gifts, any way he can to show her his love for him or her his love for her. And so he will lavish and that's the language that's used, that God has for us. He lavishes us with His grace. Later, in Ephesians, two in verse seven, it says that, it talks about the immeasurable riches of His grace, they cannot be measured. They are overflowing. That's what we have in God. And that's what we have in Christ. One other picture of abundance from Ephesians. When we pray to God, Paul says that he is able to do far more abundantly all than that we ask or think he can do more for us than we can even imagine. And so we see God as a generous giver, overflowing with gifts. And we're kind of like that cup, aren't we? We are the one that are filled not only to the brim, but overflowing with God's goodness, with His grace, with his mercy. And so we need to be faithful. We need to be thankful. And just as we have been filled with and overfilled with God's blessings, we need to be abundant in our Thanksgiving.

Jeremy Sweets  14:25
It needs to reach our hearts so that we recognize the blessings and we're thankful for them. You know, there's two ways to react when it comes to blessings. You can react with Thanksgiving or with greed. Greed says that there's never enough and I deserve that and you should give that to me and I need something else. In addition, some people when they are given prosperity, they respond with greed, and that's not enough. I need something else. But there's another way that we need to respond and that is with thanksgiving, to recognize that what has God has given us is a true blessing. It's something that we appreciate, and we're thankful for. And Luke six and verse 45, it talks about the importance of the heart when it comes to receiving blessings. The good person out of the good treasure of his heart produces good, and the evil personnel of the evil treasure and produces evil. For out of the abundance of the heart, his mouth speaks. Do you see here that Jesus is he's talking about the Pharisees and the importance of the heart, what comes out of our heart overflows from our heart will come out in our speech, and that will be either good, or it will be bad. And so we need to fill our hearts with an appreciation, and thankfulness so that that will then come out in our speech, words of thankfulness, a positive attitude and appreciation for what God has given us. On the other hand, if we are bitter, and thankless Christians, then that will also flow out of us. I think in part, that's the reason that, that Paul uses that idea of thankfulness to lead into the warning against false doctrine. We need to be grounded in the truth. And I think there's a connection between thankfulness and truth. And on the other side, bitterness, and air, I'll think about it. If we are grateful for what God has done for us, we will see the truth and we will be thankful for what He has given to us. But if we're bitter, we say Christ is not enough, or we're bitter about what he says, then we will go looking elsewhere, we will look for something more something intriguing, something that makes me special, so to speak. And I think there is a danger that we have if we fall into bitterness, and then we're susceptible to error in that regard. And we need to be careful about that. So don't let sight and take you captive. Don't let the false philosophies of the day take you captive. Don't disqualify yourself. Understand that what we have in Christ is sufficient and be thankful and be thankful. Elsewhere in Scripture, we see this picture of thankfulness in the Psalms, for example, Psalm 90 to one, it is good to give thanks to the Lord, Psalm 95 verse to let us come into His presence with thanksgiving. Let us make a joyful noise to him with the songs of praise. And again in Psalm 100, verse four, Enter his gates with thanksgiving and his courts with praise, give thanks to Him, bless his name. And there are many, many more examples of that. Praise God, be thankful. Christians need to have an attitude of gratitude. We need to be a thankful people and we should be known as the thankful people. And Colossians three in verse 17. There it says, And whatever you do in word or deed, do everything in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father, Screw him. Everything that we do should be aligned with Christ in His name, according to his character, and it should be done with thanksgiving. Everything that we do, should be aligned with Christ. And with thanksgiving. In Philippians four, verse 18, it says, Give thanks, in all circumstances, give thanks in all things for this as the will of God and Christ Jesus for you. Yes, even in 2020 we can give things can't we, even in a time of difficulty, even in times of challenge even in times of sorrow and pain, we can be thankful and that's not to discount those feelings of sorrow pain, but it is to say that in all things, we can thank God, we are blessed people. But notice not only should we give thanks in all circumstances, but notice the second part of that which we sometimes leave off, this is God's will for you.

Jeremy Sweets  19:18
God wants us to be a thankful people. We are made to be as Christians a thankful people. So we see an abundance of Thanksgiving but that that needs to also extend out to our actions as well. An abundance of good works now just wiped my nose let me just say something real quick. I've not been feeling sick. When I put that mask on. It makes my nose drip. I don't know if it's allergy Somebody asked me the other day I saw you wipe your nose. Are you feeling bad? Are you sick? I'm not so let me just alleviate you might not have been thinking of that. There might have been too much but there you go. All right. abundance of good works and abundance of good works of God receive as God's recipients are as recipients of God's blessing and grace. I'll get it right here in a second will not only give thanksgiving to him and use our words, but that will flow over and overflow into an abundance of good works as well. As gratitude flows from our hearts good works will be the product in Ephesians two and verse eight. You remember what led into that the the riches of his grace we find redemption in him the immeasurable riches of his grace? Well, in Ephesians, two in verse eight, it says For Weir's, For by grace, you have been saved through faith. And it goes on describe, say that that is not a result of works. But it's in order that you may work. So we're not saved because of what we've done. But we are saved in order that we might be those that do good works. In verse 10, of that passage. Ephesians two and verse 10. He says, For we are His workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, for good works. That's why we are Christians, to do what is good we have been made to do what is good. Paul makes a similar point in second Corinthians chapter nine, there he's talking about the collection that is to be taken up for the saints in Jerusalem. In Second Corinthians nine in verse eight. It says, And God is able to make all grace of bound to you so that having all sufficiency in all things at all times, you may abound and all every good work. God's grace and mercy fills us so that we are overflowing. And the product of that is our good works. He has enabled us. He has benefited us he has graciously given to us so that we can do good works. And we need to be people doing good things. In first Corinthians 15, in verse 58. There Paul establishes really in that chapter, He establishes the resurrection and the truth of the resurrection. We have something to live for. We will be resurrected one day and we need not discount the purpose that we have in this life. Well as he summarizes some of the points from that chapter and looks back and reflects in 58. Paul says to the Christian Christians, that they are to be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord. We're to keep on keeping on to be steadfast to continue on. In one sense, were to be immovable, we are established, we are rooted, we are grounded. But in another sense we're always be growing would always be a bounding in the work of the Lord. Does that describe your life? Are you one filled and overflowing with good works for God, that should be a picture of who we are.

Jeremy Sweets  23:12
Not only an abundance of good works, but more specifically, we need to be in abundance and have an abundance of generosity. One aspect here of good works is generosity that we are to have to others. If we truly overflow with thankfulness to God, and what he has done for us, then we will seek to spread those blessings we will overflow with generosity to others, we can be the channel of God's blessings for other people. God can use us and work through us for the benefit of others, just as God has used others to benefit us. In First Timothy chapter six, Paul talks to those that are rich in this present life. That's what he says in verse 17. As for the rich in this present age, charge them not to be haughty, nor to set their hopes on the uncertainty of riches but on God, who richly provides us with everything to enjoy. They are to do good, to be rich and good works to be generous and ready to share. The riches that we have in God should fill our hearts so that we are what ready, willing and eager to share with others. We're not to be those that have a tight fist with our blessings. This is mine. We kind of have that sense in America, don't we? Is my property my rights. You can't take them from my hand. But Christians are to have open hands. What we get we freely give. We're not to cower and hoard and say this is all mine but we're to say God has given to me Let me freely give to you We are to be a generous people. And the more wealth that we have, the more responsibility and opportunity we have to be generous. And I speak that a wealthy person to wealthy people in this country we have a tremendous amount of blessings and we need to use those for good. Going back to second Corinthians chapter nine there as he talks about the the giving, that is to take place, and the collection and the giving for the Jewish Christians. In Second Corinthians nine and verse seven. There it says, each one must give as he has decided in his heart, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver. God loves of people that give and give gladly, without remorse, not under compulsion, we don't give because we're made to or because we feel like others are watching and we want to look good in their eyes. Those are not the reasons we are to give. We're to give and give cheerfully, cheerfully. in second Corinthians chapter nine in verse 10, and 11, I've got 1011 Chapter nine verses 1011, is what it should be. He said, Who supplies seed to the sower and bread for food will supply and multiply your seed for sowing and increase the harvest of your righteousness, and verse 11, you will be enriched in every way to be generous, and everyone which through us will produce thanksgiving to God. What a beautiful picture that is. And I hope you see the cycle that is to take place here. We have been blessed by God and received tremendous blessings from God. And that should fill our hearts so that it overflows into Thanksgiving. It overflows into good works and generosity to others. And notice what he says when we are generous to other people, what will that result in thanksgiving to God, they will thank God for the blessings, the blessings that God will fill their hearts. So that thanks come out. In that a beautiful picture. There's a similar thing said about our light shining in Matthew chapter five, verse 16, where let our light shine in such a way that others see our good works. They don't pat us on the back, but they glorify our God and heaven. You say we are to be channels for God's grace and mercy, extending that to other people so that they will see the greatness of God. And so there is this beautiful cycle of we have been filled, our cup has been filled in overflows, we can extend that to other people so that they can see God's goodness. So let us be a generous people, a generous people.

Jeremy Sweets  27:55
Let me ask you this, as we conclude, have you taken advantage of the great blessings that we have in Christ? All of us enjoy whether we are good and righteous or, or wicked and do not follow after God enjoy many blessings from him. He gives us rain and sunshine and food and that's for all to enjoy. But have you taken advantage of the spiritual blessings that are found in Christ? Have you received Jesus Christ as Lord in a humble faith, repenting of your sins and submitting to God in baptism. And when you do that, that is a lifelong commitment that you make to serve him all of your days. If you haven't done that you have an opportunity to follow that process of submitting your life to Him and humble faith. confessing Jesus as the Christ repenting of your sins and being baptized. You can make a lifelong commitment this very day, and there's no greater blessing. If you have accepted the great gift of salvation, then continue to walk in the way of the Lord. Be thankful. Do good. Be generous, so that in all things, God may be glorified. There's any subject to the invitation. Please come as we stand and sing at this time.
