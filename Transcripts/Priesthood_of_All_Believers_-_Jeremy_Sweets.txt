Good morning. It's good to see everyone here today. Certainly a blessing. I feel like I'm, I'm privileged with some of the preachers. I know we're all missing being together, I get to skip around to the different crowds. And so I'm so glad to see each one of you. You're encouraging me by your presence, especially since I don't get to see you every week. So I'm just glad to see and know that you're here with us. I even see Jacob and Elora Stinson with us. They I'm sure mama Stinson is happy to have all the family home for a bit. I told Jacob we actually switched places with him or he told me that we were in Memphis, last couple days visiting and Luke and Shannon, and that's they attended the same congregation. So it's good to have you here as well. I appreciate very much the the thoughts of the Lord's Supper, the prayer that was led, the songs that were led by Jesse is he helped us focus on on purity, and drawing close to God. All of that is extremely appreciated. I think it will help us as we look at God's Word this morning.

On October 31 1517, Martin Luther took a list of 95 theses or statements of debates. And he posted those on the church door at Vinton Burg. And they say, people that study that say that that's what kicked off or that started the Protestant Reformation. It was a couple of years later in 1520, that he wrote one of the foundational documents, and has a title a mile long, but it was to the Christian nobility of the German people, and the title keeps going on because that's the way they did things. But it was a letter and what she continued to ask the question about the Pope, and whether that was a legitimate role for the church. And he said that, that, as he brought these protests, these ideas, he says that the Catholic Roman Catholic Church has built three walls around them, to protect them or insulate them from critique. He said, first of all, they have a spiritual government that they say is higher than the secular government. So if the secular government tried to bring a critique against the Roman Catholic Church, they say that the the spiritual government is above that. He says, Well, if an individual tries to bring your critique, then then the Pope says that only the Pope, only the official teaching of the Church can interpret Scripture. So that is more valid than then anything that she would have to say. And he says, Well, if if an individual seeks to call a council, then the Catholic Church says no, only the pope can call a council. And so he had critiques about what he had was saw was going on, he says that we're not able to get through, we're not able to talk about these things. Well, as he wrote that letter, one of the points that he brought up is he talked about the spiritual priesthood that the Catholic Church had developed the Holy Orders that they had developed. One of the statements he made, is that every, every Christian is a priest. A person has not made a crease, but made a pre simply by one that has been ordained, so to speak by the church. But every Christian is a priest. I'd like to talk for just a few moments this morning about the priesthood of all believers. And we're not going to the Reformation, to prove our point. They were men seeking to look to God's word, and that's our goal. We want to look to God's word. And I think this is a biblical concept that we need to see and understand. In first Peter two and verse five. And I'll begin in verse four reading it says, As you come to him, a living stone rejected by men, but in the sight of God, chosen and precious. You yourselves like living stones are being built up as a spiritual house to be a holy priesthood, to offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God, through Jesus Christ. We see in first Peter to in verse five, he says that you are all Christians, you are living stones, and you are being built up into a spiritual house, actually preached a sermon on a spiritual house from this text. And as I study that, I intended to preach this lesson, but I was impressed by that communal nature and so I did that first. But I want you to see that both of these things are at play in this passage, he says that you are living stones being built up together. And you might think of interlocking bricks being put together. God's Church is a collection of Christians that when they come together, they are a temple that seeks to praise God. That's what we've done this morning. We've offered our praise and worship to Him. And we are encouraged and strengthened as we come together. But he also says there's an individual component about this, and that we are all priests as well, in that beautiful imagery were both the temple, the structure, the building together, but we're also the priesthood inside of the temple. And what is the say about this priests to be a holy priesthood to offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God, through Jesus Christ,

Jeremy Sweets  06:00
there is both a communal aspect to our faith and an individual aspect to our faith, and we need both, we need both. We are not saved simply by belonging to the right group, regardless of how we live, we have to understand that that we have to have a personal faith. But God also never intended that we would be renegade Christians that run off and try to do this all by ourselves. That's never been his intent, either. And so we see that we are both the temple. And we are priests. We are priests. And that's an amazing thought within itself, too. That tells me that there are no second class citizens, there is no hierarchy, there is no distinction between a clergy and laity. We have several men here that speak on a regular basis, but I hope you understand that doesn't elevate us. above you. The elders are not first class Christians and everyone else, second class Christians. The elders have a function in a job and important one, deacons do as well. But we are all priests to God. We are all priests to God. Now, that is a empowering idea. That's an exciting idea. But that's also a sobering and a fearful thing. We are coming before Almighty God, ourselves, to talk to him to pray to him to have a relationship with him. So we see that we are both temple, and priests. As we notice further, this is really an idea that's been seen throughout Scripture, particularly in Exodus chapter 19, you may remember that the Israelites left Egypt, they exited out of Egypt, through the 10 plagues that God's displayed among the Egyptians. And they were called to be a people of God, and as they come to Mount Sinai, and Exodus 19, and verse five, says, Now therefore, if you will, indeed obey my voice, and keep all my covenant, you shall be My treasured possession among all peoples, for all the earth is mine, and you shall be to Me a kingdom of priests, and a holy nation. Now, in the Old Testament, they did have a priesthood. But I find it fascinating in this passage, he says, in a sense, you're all to be priest, you're to be a kingdom of priests. And as may relate, I'm not exactly sure this may relate to the fact that all of them would have offered up a Passover sacrifice for their family. And so it was not simply the priests from the Levites that did that, that would have come from within the families for that group there. But whatever that means, I think there is an idea that, that all people are to act as this priesthood. We continue on to Revelation chapter one, as we come to the New Testament, we see that we are all to be priests, there is no longer a Levitical priesthood, for a segment of the body, but rather we are all priest, Revelation one in verse five. It says to him who loves us and is freed us from our sins, by His blood and made us a kingdom, Priest, to his God and Father, to Him be glory and dominion forever and ever. Amen. And so we see that we are a kingdom of priests. We are all to be priests unto God, and a priest is one that would approach God offering sacrifices that were there to commune with Him in that sense.

Jeremy Sweets  10:06
And through this, we have access to God. In the Old Testament, the priests would enter into the the holy place, the tabernacle was divided into two compartments, there was the holy place that held the utensils for regular worship, we might say, and then there was a holy of holies, the back section, it was in the form of a perfect cue. And there the Ark of the Covenant was, which represented the presence of God, and the high priests would enter into the Holy of Holies, which was separated by a curtain, the high priests would enter into the Holy of Holies, one time a year, and he would make sacrifice for himself, and for the people. And even then he did not witness the Ark of the Covenant for it was surrounded by a cloud was may have provided some protection for that individual. And so in that sense, the the priests would come on behalf of the people. When we come to the New Testament, we see that Jesus Christ is our high priest, he did not make annual or daily sacrifices, but he made one sacrifice, he made the sacrifice of His own body. And we see that as He sacrificed Himself on the cross that he provided access for us. And Hebrews, chapter nine, it says in every priest stands daily at his surface, offering repeatedly the same sacrifice which can never take away sins. But when Christ had offered for all time, a single sacrifice for us, he sat down at the right hand of God. And so he provides for us or we have access to God through Jesus Christ. Now, you may remember the old testament and that tabernacle and temple, there was a curtain, a veil, that separated the holy place from the Holy of Holies. When Jesus Christ died, there is a text that says in Matthew 2751, the the curtain of the temple was torn into going from top to bottle. Jesus Christ, when He offered the one sacrifice of His body, that veil was torn in to, there was no longer a division there that separated us from God. And so what Jesus Christ provides for us is access to God. In Ephesians, two, verse 18, it says, free through him both, and they're both means Jew and Gentile. For through him, both Jew and Greek, have access in one spirit to the Father.

Jeremy Sweets  12:59
What an amazing passage, we have access to God, we're no longer separated. In that sense, Jesus Christ has provided for us access to God. And so we are to be priests that approach God in prayer, and worship in our lives, every single one of us. It's not just mine, not just me, or one of the elders, every single one of us, is a priest unto God, and have access to him. I'd like to spend the rest of the time now just talking about a few ways in which we are all priests, we are all priests. The first one I want to consider is in our covenant relationship with him. I don't always use that language that's really borrowed from the Old Testament, a covenant was an agreement that was made between God and His people. And in the New Testament, we have an incense a covenant with God, we can approach him, member Exodus 19, verse five, you shall be my people, and I will be your God. That is the relationship that we're talking about. And we can have a covenant relationship with God. And we can do that by reading scripture. By reading scripture, the elders have emphasized in January, and they've done this really every year that I can remember to, to encourage us all to develop a habit of reading scripture daily. They don't say this, we're the elders and we're gonna read the scripture for you and you just need to listen to what we say. Now they are teachers, they do provide instruction, but they encourage us all, to read God's word, and to read it for ourself. And Ephesians three and verse four, there, Paul says, when you read this, my letter that he wrote, when you read this, you can perceive mine insight into the mystery of Christ, which was not made known to the sons of men and other generations, as it has now been revealed to His holy apostles and prophets by the spirits. And so we see that God reveals His word to the apostles, they wrote it down, and we, even 2000 years later, we can read it, and understand it. And so we are all called to be Bible students, to be readers of God's word, to put those things into our heart, so that we can come to an understanding of God's Word. Even for those that were not able to read many in the first century, we're not revelation one and verse three says, Bless it as the one who reads aloud the words of the prophecy. And blessed are those who hear. So there was a reading and a hearing of God's word, even among those that were not able to read, every one of us needs to read and study God's Word. Now, let me just add, that that's going to require diligence on our part, isn't it? That's going to require work. As we do that. Let me also add that, that when a single individual, like the Pope is saying, This is the teaching, well, the Catholics those that follow that religion, they didn't have to understand they allow the Pope to do that. And you know what, there was no disagreement there. Well, Martin Luther says there was a little bit but if there is one person saying what to teach and believe, then everyone just accepts that there's not going to be much division there. Right? One of the critiques of the Protestant Reformation is now that everyone could read and understand there's going to be a lot more division. So not only do we have to be diligent students of God's word, but if everyone is seeking to read and understand God's Word, we have to reason together, don't we? We have to be patient with others, because we will not have an exact understanding of Scripture all together. Now, on a high level, I believe that, that we can all understand God's word, and we can all understand that alike and walk in March in the same direction. But when we talk about every single doctrine, or teaching or verse that we might seek to understand and interpret. That's going to take patience, it's going to take dialogue and studying together and working together. And so we see, we are all priests. And we all need to be reading and interpreting and understanding God's word.

Jeremy Sweets  17:44
Not only that, but we are all called to have faith in God, to have faith in God. And Hebrews 11, in verse six, it says, And without faith, it is impossible to please Him for whoever would draw near to God must believe that He exists, and that He rewards those who seek Him. Whoever comes to God must believe that He is that he exists, and that he will reward those that diligently seek Him faith is needed by each and every one of us. You are not born physically as an infant, into the church. You are not a Christian, by virtue of what your parents decide for you. You are not a Christian, based upon what kind of preacher was at your church, you are not a Christian based upon the faith of someone else. You become a Christian based upon your own faith and your own commitments. No one can do that for you. You must believe whoever comes to God must develop this faith and trust in Him, we're all called to that. We are all called to that. And so we must have faith in God. And that's why baptism is for adults that make that conscious decision. It's not for infants that cannot decide. It's not to baptize them to wash away sin that they have not committed. But rather it is for those that are adults that have made a commitment and a decision to follow after God. That's why in First Corinthians chapter 12, and verse 12, he says, For just as the body is one and has many members, and all the members of the body, though many are one body, so it is with Christ. For in one Spirit, we were all baptized into one body. Jews are Greek slaves are free and all were made to drink of one spirit. Notice again that there is no first class and second class. The Jews were not considered the first class Christians if they exist. tempted in the Gentiles second know, we are all worn. We don't allow the world to dictate to us, you know the world likes to rank, don't they? The master is greater than the slay well not in Christ. We are all one in Christ. And notice what he says, we've all been baptized, every single person can make that decision and gain access to God and have forgiveness of sins through that. And so we see that we can come before God through a decision that we would make to have faith to submit to Him, to humble ourselves before Him and receive the precious gift of Jesus Christ. And so every one of us can have a covenant relationship with God needs to have a covenant relationship with God. Let me also suggest that every single one of us can worship God. And First Peter to in verse five, it says that we are called to be a holy priesthood, to offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ, every single one of us can and should worship God. And that tells us something about worship here, isn't it? Even though I'm the one speaking, I hope and pray that you are listening, looking at God's word, digesting the things. Even though there is a leader up front, we are all worshipping together. And every single one of us must do that. We can do that in prayer. And prayer, probably could have two components to it can't. That probably goes also with the previous point about a covenant relationship, we can approach God in prayer. What an amazing thought. In Hebrews four in verse 16, it says, because of the work of Jesus Christ, this high priest, because he can sympathize with our weaknesses, having been tempted and always as we are, it says in verse 16, let us then with confidence, draw near to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need.

Jeremy Sweets  22:20
We can and should pray to God on a regular basis. And so we see the the benefit there of prayer and our personal relationship with God. Now, the Scripture also talks about praying for others. So we need to be doing that as well. Prayer is also something that we do as a community when we come together. And again, let me emphasize there may be one leading the prayer. But we are all praying, speaking to God, and so worships not a time to tune out or think about other things or take a mental vacation. That's not what happens when we worship. We all are lifting our hearts and our thoughts up to Almighty God, worshiping Him. We also see that singing is done. And here we practice congregational singing, because that's what we see in Scripture. In Colossians three, verse 16, it says, Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly. Teaching and admonishing one another, in all wisdom, singing psalms, and hymns and spiritual songs with thankfulness in your hearts to God. We don't have a performance here. There's not a select few singers that qualify that stand before us and sing to us praises, but rather we all sing praises together, whether you are an excellent singer, and we have many they're here that are like that, or you're like me, that that can't really carry a tune in a bucket that that doesn't matter. We bring our hearts to God. And we sing to each other, and encourage each other. We all are worshipers in that sense. And so we practice, congregational singing everyone is to sing to God and sing to one another, encourage one another as well. We also see that we all partake of the Lord's Supper. This is not something where the clergy takes the elements and we simply witness that or where some kind of priesthood takes maybe the bread only and then some other people get other things or takes the fruit of the vine everyone gets the bread, but we all partake of the Lord's Supper. In first Corinthians 10 And verse 16, says the couple of blessing that we bless, is it not a participation in the blood of Christ? That's not reserved for a few every Christian. The brand that we break, is it not? participation in the body of Christ. In the next chapter in chapter 11, it says, When you come together to protect the Lord suffer, and he has some some problems that he addresses them with. Problem is you're not really coming together, you're, some of you are having a lot there, and some are having none. You're excluding some. And he criticizes them for that. Because the church was to come together, and every person was to protect the Lord suffer. And he says, they're in a place where they would often have to travel, and maybe come at different times, they didn't have cars, and you know, watches quite like we did. He says, wait for one another. Even what the world would consider the lowest, lowest a member, maybe the slave out there, wait for everyone. Everyone is important, everyone is vital. Everyone is to partake of the Lord's Supper. We are all priests offering our worship to God in prayer, in Psalm in taking of the Lord's Supper, and so we are all priests, all lifting our worship and praise to Him. We are also priests and that every Christian is to be a worker, to fulfill the mission of God in, in a general sense, in second Timothy two in verse 15, Paul tells Timothy, Timothy was an evangelist, he says, do your best to present yourself to God as one approved a worker who has no need to be ashamed. And so Paul instructs Timothy be a worker for God. And Paul was to our Timothy was 10, struck that message also to every Christian, in First Corinthians 15, as he talks about the importance of the resurrection, and that that is a basis for our faith. He says there that we are to.

Jeremy Sweets  27:02
He says, Therefore, my beloved brothers be steadfast, unmovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, we are all to be workers in the kingdom. That's not reserved for a select few. We don't have a full time minister that has devoted himself full time to that my Conrad and I also have other jobs as well. But even if we did have a full time minister, someone that was devoting their entire time to preaching the gospel, that that can be a very good and beneficial thing. But that does not mean that every other Christian should not be working. They're not doing by themselves, the work of the church. No, they are a priest, just like every other priests that is doing the work that they can, they have the ability, and the opportunity to do. And so it is for each one of us, we might have a full time job, we might be at a workplace and we can still give glory to God and and do what we can to influence others even in that place. You see, the work of God is not reserved to the clergy, or a select few. It's for us all. And that's the point that is made in First Corinthians chapter 12. We are many members of one body, but we're all important. We're all contributing to the proper functioning and working of the body. We are also all to be priests in the sense that we are all to live holy lives. I think sometimes we make a distinction between first and second class Christian, we may not use that language, but we have in our head. Well, he's an elder, he he's a preacher elders, what? That someone that we would expect to be holy, but that's really not for me. I mean, I attend and I do all that, but I don't have to do what they do. I don't have to quite live holy all the time. No, as a priest, we're called to live holy lives. First Peter to in verse five says it is a holy priesthood. And if we are all to be priest, we are all to be holy priests, godly priests. It is incumbent upon each one of us to seek to live godly before him. None of us can allow sin to rain. None of us can allow sin to continue in our lives. We need to address that. We need to work on that. That's not saying we'll never sin, but we never give up striving to put that behind us as the point we never give up on that. And so we must live holy lives in first Peter one in verse 14. Peter says As obedient children do not be conformed to the passions of your former ignorance. But as he who called you is holy, you also be holy in all your conduct, since it is written, You shall be holy, for I am holy. In the Old Testament, the priests would make a sacrifice for themselves as they sought to approach God, remove sin. And so it is for each one of us, we seek to put sand behind us so we can approach God, we cannot approach God full of sin evil in our hearts. God will have none of that, for he is a holy God, and He calls us to be holy. And so we work diligently. We strive, we rely upon the grace of God, and we keep moving for striving to be ever more holy before him.

Jeremy Sweets  30:53
We also see this is true in evangelism. And that is that each one of us has to be a minister, a servant evangelist. Again, there may be someone that that is devoting their full time to that work. But that's something that we all can do. And we all may play a different role in that. It may be that you are finding a contact, you are finding someone that is interested in studying God's Word. And that can be about maybe your help setting up the study. Maybe you know, people that are interested and you set them up with someone that can do the study or whatever the case is, we're all to be involved in evangelism. And Acts chapter eight and verse four, when a persecution came upon the the early church there it says that they were spread out from Judea from where they had gathered, and they went about preaching the word Acts, chapter eight, and verse four, they went out preaching the word, I love that imagery, you know, we're gathered here today are, and we're not necessarily fleeing our homes, but we can go out from this building, scattered from here, all parts of Nashville, and what can we do that they did preach the Word, we can take God's word to someone else. And so we are to be scattered, and preach and proclaim the Word. And First Peter to in verse nine, says, But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, people for His own possession, that you may proclaim the excellencies of Him who called you out of darkness, into His marvelous light. We are the people of God, a holy priesthood, and what is one of the main purposes they are the function of what we're to serve as a priest, we offer sacrifice to the God but then we proclaim to others, the excellencies of Him who called us from darkness into light. And guess what we tell others, he can do the same for you. We're not special. In that sense, God wants everyone to be a child of God. And so there's a very real sense in Scripture in which there is a priesthood of all believers, every Christian is a priest. We've been talking this year and started to talk about the fact that, that we are to be holding God's hand. We do that and in good times and bad, through pains and struggles we rely upon him and his strength. Let me just add to that, that that is a call for each one of us. Not just a few. We are all called to hold on to God's hand, to have a personal relationship with him as we work together within the community of saints, his church, in his body. If you're here this morning, and you're not a Christian, you have an opportunity to obey the gospel message, believing that Jesus is the Christ repenting of your sins, confessing Jesus as the Christ and being baptized into water for forgiveness of sins. That's a call for each and every one. Everyone can do that and have their sins washed away. If you're here this morning, and you are a Christian, but you're not honoring your commitment to live holy and godly before him. You also need to make changes so that you can align your life with the original commitment that you made to serve God all the days of your life. If there are any subject to the invitation, please come as we stand and seen at this time
