Let me encourage you to open your Bibles to Psalm 51. Psalm 51. I am reading from the New American Standard Bible. I am not trying to make an argument that this is the best translation of the only translation. But I just want you to know where I'm reading. From what I'm reading from. This is a 1995 edition of the New American Standard Bible. But let's first of all, read Psalm 51 and get its words before us. And then we'll try to make several points on the text. If you are a visitor here, I want you to know we want you to know that we are just trying to look at the Bible and to seek to understand it and apply it to our life. And that is our process this morning. The title of Psalm 51 says to the choir director, a Psalm of David when Nathan the prophet came to him after he had gone into Bathsheba. First one Be gracious to me, oh God, according to your loving kindness, according to the greatness of your compassion, blot out my transgression. Wash me thoroughly from my iniquity and cleanse me from my sin. For I know my transgressions, and my sin is ever before me, against you, and you only I have said and done what is evil in your sight. So you are justified when you speak and blameless, when you judge. But hold on was brought forth in iniquity and in sin, my mother conceived me, behold you desire truth and the innermost being and the hidden part you will make me no wisdom, purify me with hyssop and I shall be clean, wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow. Make me to hear joy and gladness and let the bones which you have broken rejoice, hide your face from my sins, and blot out all my inequities. Create in me a clean heart, O God, and renew a steadfast spirit within me. Do not cast me away from your presence, and do not take your Holy Spirit from me. Restore to me the joy of your salvation and sustain me with a willing spirit, then I will teach transgressors your ways, and sinners will be converted to you. Deliver me from blood guiltiness Oh God, the God of my salvation, that my tongue will joyfully sing of your righteousness. Oh, no word, opened my lips that my mouth may declare your praise. For you do not delight in sacrifice, otherwise, I would give it you are not pleased with Bert offering the sacrifices of God or a broken spirit a broken and contrite heart, oh God, you will not despise. By your favor, do good design and build the walls of Jerusalem. Then you will delight in righteous sacrifices, invert offerings and Holbert offerings, the young bull will be offered on your altar.

Unknown Speaker  03:59
In Second Samuel 12 After David Second Samuel 11 Records David's adultery with Bathsheba, and then he has Uriah Bathsheba his husband killed in order to cover his seeing. The prophet Nathan comes to him. This would not have been unusual for a king in the land to hear a case because the king was the highest judge in all the land. And Nathan the prophet tells him a parable. He says there were two men in a city. And one man was rich with many flocks and herds, and one was poor, with only one little ewe lamb that was brought up as one of the members of the family it ate their table. It slept in their bed, there came a visitor to the rich man, instead of the rich man taking from one of his many herds in many flocks to feed his guests. He goes to the poor man and takes his only ewe lamb, and slaughters him and serves him to the guest. David heard this thing and says, the man who has done this deserves to die, because he has done this, and he has had no compassion. And Nathan says, You are the man. You're the one that has done this. David's response was I have sinned against the Lord. That is how he responds to see it in Second Samuel 12 And verse 13. But do not underestimate the agony of David soul. For Psalm 51 shows us the depth of his pain, it shows us how deeply this hurt him, and how much he recognized. His only hope, was God's mercy, and God's compassion, and God's grace. That we want to as we go throughout the text to focus on some of these words from Psalm 51. But first of all, I would say that this patch reveals to us that our sin is worse than we ever realized. That may not sound like good news, in and of itself. And indeed, of itself is not but it will lead to good news. Our sin is worse than we realize. And particularly those verses, verses three through six, bring out this truth. I know my transgression, and my sin is ever before me. It was like the sin was constantly there, and he could not forget it. He could not shake it. my sin is ever before me. He says against you. And you only I have said and done what is evil in your side? If some of you may say soft there, how could it be that David would say against you? And you only I have seen when he has committed adultery with another man's wife, and had that man killed in order to cover his sin? How could he say that? Well, I don't believe this text is denied, that he made has sinned against Bathsheba that David has sinned against Uriah that David has sinned against himself. I think this scene is stressing this passage is stressing that the worst thing about seeing though is what sin does to God. That's what the passage is Tracy.

Unknown Speaker  08:04
Do you remember Genesis 39. And part of his wife says to Joseph Lie with me. And Joseph says in Genesis 39. He says, My master is committed everything in the house to me except you, because you are his wife. And how then can I do this great wickedness and catch this word? How can I do this great wickedness and sin against God as Genesis 39 verses eight and nine for Joseph to commit adultery with part of his Why would be to sin against God, the worst role that he would do if he did that would not be what he did two part of her the one he did to God. The New Testament has the same kind of picture. In first Corinthians chapter eight, the Bible is warning it gets causing your brother to stumble about issues like what food you ate, what meets you a don't cause your brother to stumble. And the Bible says in first Corinthians eight verse 12. And so by sinning against the brethren and wounding their conscience, when it's weak, you sin against Christ, when you call someone to fall away, because of how you act in such matters. You see it against Christ. Our sin is worse than we realize. Because it is cosmic treason against a perfectly good God, who has blessed us over and over over and over again. Our sin is worse than we realize. You might look at your life. And your sins may not look as bad as those things portrayed on the nightly news. And I think sometimes, watching the news, while it can be deeply disturbing can also be comforting. Because we might think when we look at their lives, we're doing pretty good by comparison. But when you start comparing your lie to the light, in the holiness of God revealed in Scripture, you're going to say, and I'm going to say, Woe is me, for I am under, I am a man of unclean lips, and I live among the people of unclean lips. That's what Isaiah said in Isaiah six in verse five, when he saw the holiness of God. And when we look at our lives, in light of God, in light of who he is,

Unknown Speaker  11:18
we're going to be brought to knee our knees with a recognition of our sin. If I were to ask you, what's the worst thing you've ever done?

Unknown Speaker  11:35
And you think about all those times you've done things wrong. You've said things wrong. And you've had wrong attitudes that have never been Express.

Unknown Speaker  11:53
Free and I want to tell you, whether it be in my life, or in your lie. Those things are not minor matters. They are cosmic catastrophes. They are rebellion against God. But the good news of Psalm 51 is that while our sin, our sin is worse than we ever realized, his grace is greater than we can imagine. His forgiveness is greater than we commit can imagine. Yes, we will, too. I want to we want to bring this to our knees over our fear that we bring you to your knees over your sin, not to leave you there in a state of despair or not to drive you to do something self destructive. We lead you to that position so that you might cast yourself up on the mercy and grace of God, a God who is always ready to forgive a God who is more ready to forgive than we are to turn from our sins. In Psalm 51, Be gracious to me Be gracious to me, actually, all of that one word. In Hebrew, it's a word to indicate God's mercy, God's Christ. Three of the most important words in the whole Old Testament, to emphasize the nature of God are used right here in Psalm 51. The word be gracious, the word loving kindness, and the word compassion. The word loving kindness wraps up God's patience in God's mark, mercy and God's long suffering all into one word, the word compassion is actually connected to the Hebrew word for womb, and just as a mother has compassion on the child of her womb, so God has compassion on us. Be gracious to me, oh God, according to your loving kindness, according to the magnitude of Your mercy or the greatness of your compassion, blot out my transgressions. All these three words are used in that passage in Exodus 34. In verse six, the Lord the Lord God, compassionate, and gracious, slow to anger, abounding in lovingkindness. God is a God who is anxious to forgive. If your sins are worse than you ever realized, we're encouraging you to run to him. No for mercy, to turn to Him for His grace, Be gracious to me, according to your loving kindness, according to the greatness of your compassion, blot out my transgressions. I referenced Exodus 34 Just a second ago. Let me explain to you the context of that. In Exodus 20, Moses received the 10 commandments. Moses reads those words, in other words, that God told Israel, he goes and reads those words to Israel, and Israel says, All the Lord has spoken we will do. All the Lord has spoken we will do they said that at least why? Moses goes on the mountain for 40 days. And during that 40 days, the people who below said all the Lord is focused, we will do quickly forget all of that. And they quickly disregard God. They make a graven image to represent God. They engage in sexual immorality, they sit down to eat and drink, and they rose up to play. They are so wicked that God says to Moses, I will destroy this people and I'll start again with you, and I'll make them into a great nation. But Moses intercedes for the people. Moses pleads for God have mercy on this people. These people have violated the most fundamental elements of what God has told them to do. And the Lord reveals himself as the Lord, the Lord God, compassionate

Unknown Speaker  16:52
and gracious, slow to anger, and abounding in lovingkindness. God's grace is always wanting to forgive. If your sins are worse than you imagined, his grace is greater than your seeing. Father had two sons. The youngest son said, Father give me the share of the estate that falls to me said that without any gratitude or tact, give me the share of the estate that falls to me. His father divided his inheritance gave the portion the younger son would have received the younger son quickly takes it and leaves home and goes away to a faraway country and waste his father's money on riotous living. There's a famine in that country, he begins to be in need. He hires himself out to one of the citizens of the country and finds a job feeding swine. Now, swine were unclean animals, according to the Old Testament, Leviticus 11, and Deuteronomy 14 that were unclean animals. And a Jewish boy wouldn't have thought about having anything to do with swine. And now the only job he can find is feeding swine, and not only feeding the Oh, but he notices that they eat better than he does. And he says to himself, how many of my father's hired servants have more than enough bread and I am perishing with hunger. I want to get in, I'm gonna go to my father. And I'm going to say to my Father, Father, I have sinned against heaven. And before you, I'm no longer worthy to be called your son. Just make me as one of your hired servants. After all, this son has died. Does his father even want to see him again? He has taken a third of his father's Well, a third of what he had spent his whole life attaining. He's taken that he has blown it and he has nothing to show. He has disgraced his father's name. He has shamed him in the place that he lived with his father even wore him again. If the son had any doubts, they're quickly erased when the Bible tells us See that his father saw him a great way all and ran to him and greeted him. And he said, My son has come back, put a ring on his finger and shoes on his feet. And let us kill the fatted calf and rejoice. Yes, God is anxious to receive him back. His grace is greater than we imagined. But I'll tell you, if you understand you're seeing you understand His mercy and grace, but also understand that God is asking for a complete surrender of ourselves to heal a complete surrender of our spirits to him. In Psalm 51, verses 13, verses 16 and 17, you do not delight in sacrifice, otherwise, I would give it you are not pleased with Bert offering the sacrifices of God or a broken spirit, a broken and contrite heart, O God, you will not despise. In the Old Testament, Leviticus dealt with and you read from Leviticus this morning. But the earlier part of Leviticus deals with bringing sacrifices to God, at times of seeing, the Bible says God does not delight in the ease. This is not a statement to say that God doesn't care about those sacrifices. But it is to say that the giving of the outer sacrifice is an indication of a broken heart, a broken spirit before God, a heart that is willing to say, I'm not going to walk my way, but your way.

Unknown Speaker  21:44
A broken and contrite heart, God will not despise if you understand what you're saying, is worse than you ever realized. And you understand that he is the answer, that he is the one to who we must turn because his grace is greater than we can imagine. Understand that he wants a full surrender of you heart, soul and mind to him. Often the Old Testament when people were grieving or mourning their sin, they tore their clothes. They tore their clothes. Bad news, like Jacob tore his clothes when he thinks he has learned that Joseph has died. Mordecai, Mordecai tears his clothes when he hears the fate, this plan for the Jewish people in the book of Esther, but in the book of Joe will, Joe will says and Joe will to 13 we call the people he rebuked the people for their sin. He said, Read your heart and not your garments. Tear your tear your heart apart. May your heart be broken. It may your desire to walk in his way. Be a complete surrender to Him. His forgiveness, his forgiveness is complete. Look at Psalm 51 Verse seven through nine. purify me with hyssop. And I shall be clean. Wash me and I will be wider than snow. Yes, is not mentioned very frequently in the Old Testament that used hyssop to put the blood of the Passover lamb on the doorpost and Exodus 12 Verse 22. hyssop also appears quite frequently in Leviticus 16, Leviticus 14, Leviticus 14, and numbers mighty. Leviticus 14 deals with leprosy and skin diseases. And leprosy was one of the most severe forms of uncleanness that you can contract the Old Testament numbers 19 deals with coming in contact with a dead body and the process of being cleansed from that unclean this but two of the worst forms of claim this in the Old Testament, are connected with you personally contacting a dead body or with you having a skin disease or leprosy. And in both of these context, the Bible mentions hyssop used in purifying rituals. And this is my point on verse seven, purify me with hyssop, and I shall be cleaned. The hyssop, which was used in purifying someone from the most defiling of objects is mentioned as being used in connection with our CNN. This shows us the magnitude of our sin, but it also shows us the completeness of God's forgiveness, purify me with hyssop, and I shall be clean, wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow, though your sins be a scarlet. They shall be why snow, Isaiah one in verse 18. Last year, we moved to Indiana after living in Florida for 17 years. And there are good and bad things about living everywhere. I have to admit it growing up in this area of Middle Tennessee.

Unknown Speaker  26:37
I guess this goes back to my childhood. But I was always excited when there was snow. I suppose it goes back to when I was young snowman dos school. And even after school days in India, that feelings still creeps up in my heart. And after not seeing snow for 17 years, in Florida, it was a blessing to move to Indiana. And to see it our house is very open. And it didn't snow one day about 10 inches at the wonder of God's creation. The beauty of it holds amazing, but I'll tell you something that I was reminded of and seeing snow again is how, why and how bright it is. I woke up one morning it looked like it's why I'm thinking how did I sleep this long. And I look out and it's my clocks is 530 but because the whiteness of the snow, it made it look like it was much later in the day.

Unknown Speaker  28:01
And that is used as a picture as a picture of God's forgiveness. purify me with hyssop and I shall be clean. Wash me in I shall be whiter than snow.

Unknown Speaker  28:23
Yes, your sin is worse than you ever realized. But his forgiveness is so complete. is so full, it is so thorough, that we can be purified of all uncleanness we can be washed from every stain. Verse nine hide your face from my sins. Sometimes the psalm is vague in urgent with urgently Lord, do not hide your face from me. Psalm 13 verse one, an example of that, but he's begging God now hide your face, but hide your face not from me. Hide your face from my sins and blot out all my iniquities. I can remember growing up in this area and hearing local preachers and hearing preachers in meeting say things like this that you could come forward tonight and you can make your life right with God by being baptized into Christ for remission of sins, and you can rest assured that all your sins are washed away all your sins are washed away. They you are wider than snow. And if you never arose another day in your life, if you never lived another day, you can go to sleep knowing that this is your last night that you're going to be with God That's pretty powerful, isn't it? For some of you, we make the plea to experience that forgiveness. For those of us who have been blessed with that, forgiveness, what I would say is that receiving God's forgiveness is a reason to praise him. A reason to thank you. It is a reason to tell others about he'll look at verses 13 through 15. Again, as he said, let me begin in verse 12, Restore to me the joy of your salvation, sustain me with a willing spirit, that I will teach transgressors your ways, and sinners will be converted to you. He wants to be restored to a right relationship with God so that he can tell other people about God's forgiveness, about God's mercy about God's compassion in long suffering, I will teach transgressors your ways and sinners who will be converted to you to liver me, verse 14, from blood guiltiness, oh God, the God of my salvation, then my Tom will joyfully sing of your righteousness, oh, Lord opened my lips at my mouth made it clear your praise, those of us who have understood that we were dead in sin, that we were part of that picture of Romans one, verses 18 through 32. And yet, Jesus died for us in Romans five. And now we have the hope that he's God before, it's not gonna be against us in Romans 831 through 39, for those of us who have that hope, we need to praise his home and open our lips and to exalt his name. Those of us who have been forgiven so much, have much to praise him for and many things to tell to others. I think that just a little reflection, can show how all these points bring us to the crawls. Our scene is worse than we ever realized. freehand it was because of your scene. And my scene that Jesus had to die on the crawl that he went through that horrible mistreatment that incredible abuse. That horribly shameful event, and incredibly painful moment of the crawl.

Unknown Speaker  33:02
Because that's what it took to save you. To save me from RC and our cn is shown there to be worse than we ever realized, but also in the cross of Christ, His grace is shown to be greater than we can imagine. When that's the way that the only way that there could be salvation for us. That's what Christ did. We say the words I love you pretty cheaply in our society. How many people do you love enough to die for?

Unknown Speaker  33:57
Everyone here, and everyone in the world has someone that loved them enough to die for them. His grace is greater than we can imagine. And he calls for a full surrender of ourselves to heal. If any man will come after Me, let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow Me. He called for a full surrender of yourselves and of me to him. But his forgiveness is complete. So much so that when Peter preached on the day of Pentecost, this Jesus you crucified God is made both Lord and Christ. He said you have had a part in his crucifixion. Maybe some of them have been involved that crowd who's shouting Crucify Him, Crucify Him, and they cry out being in Reverend, what should we do? Do you know when the Old Testament to kill a king was a capital offense? And when someone came to David with the news that he had killed, so David had him executed to kill the Anointed One was a capital offense, and that is what this crowd has done. And the answer to the question, meaning brethren, what should we do? Should it be in if everything was fair and right, it's too late. You've already rejected him. But their rejection opened up the door of forgiveness. He said, Repent, and be baptized, every one of you, in the name of Jesus Christ, for the remission of your sins, and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit for the promise is to you and your children, to all who are far off even as many as the Lord our God shall call. And that day, they were adding to the all that gladly received his word were baptized, and that day we're adding to do 3000 souls. And these 3000 souls went out and told the good news so that pretty soon there were 5000 men, and they continue to grow by leaps and bounds, because those who had been forgiven so much, told the good news to others. And where are you in that chapter? Where are you in this sob day? If you're still in your scene, and we want to appeal to you, to turn to Him for mercy, because his mercy is greater than we ever imagined. If you need to do what they did on the day of Pinnacle's, Repent, and be baptized for the remission of your sins. We want to help you the brethren here want to help you do that. As we stay in
