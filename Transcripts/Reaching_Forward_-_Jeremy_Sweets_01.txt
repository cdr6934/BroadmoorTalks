Well, good evening. It is good to see everyone here. We are a little bit smaller in Chrome. But as Kurt said, we had vigor at heart, right? Yeah. No matter how many are here, it's it's good to be here. There are some congregations that don't even have this number that meet regularly. So it's a blessing to see each and every one of you. And I'm glad to be able to spend this time worshiping with you have been encouraged so far. And I'm looking forward to looking at God's word with you. It is a new year, you know, time just seems to keep marching on. I remember saying to my wife, I'm sure you say this to whoever you're around, I can't believe it's October. I can't believe it's December, I can't believe that it's time to turn another page on the calendar. We have turned the year. And when we turn that year, it's a time really of reflecting on time itself. We look back at the prior year we reflect, we think about what has happened. But as we turn the page, we also look forward don't. And that's natural, and especially with 2020 behind us for we kind of say good riddance to that year, we're ready to look forward. And so a new year means new possibilities, new potential. It's just the time of newness. Many people make resolutions they are they are geared and ready for thinking about what they want to change in their life and what newness they want to to have happen. For Christians, though, this is not a single occurrence. You mean, I mean, a mindset that happens just once we don't just say, Well, I'm going to look forward this one time, or I'm going to look to change this one time. But really Christians have in their hearts that that attitude anyway. We are a people that look for. We are a people that that continue to strive to grow and mature and our holiness, or godliness and our relationship with God. And that doesn't just happen once a year. It happened. It should happen all the time. But the world is thinking about those things now. And why not take advantage? Why not take advantage about thinking about newness. I like to look at the idea of reaching forward, reaching forward. I don't think anyone displays this attitude in Scripture more, at least in my mind than Paul. He was one that was constantly reaching forward, he models for us this mindset. And I think we would do well to imitate his example and his attitude in reaching forward. If you would open your Bibles to Philippians three, verses 12 through 16. And we'll simply begin by reading this passage. Philippians three, we're starting in verse 12. This is one of the prison epistles Paul wrote from prison. But it shows a joyful tone. It displays an attitude of hope, of looking forward of joy. And so we see Paul demonstrating this as we come to chapter three, he begins to tell the Philippians about righteousness, about how he attains righteousness, not by his own words, but by faith in Christ. And he says in verse 12,

Jeremy Sweets  03:42
not that I have already obtained this or morally perfect, but I press on to make it my own. Because Christ Jesus has made me his own brothers, I do not consider that I have made it my own. But one thing I do, forgetting what lies behind and straining forward to what lies ahead, I press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus, let those of us who are mature think this way. And if in anything you think otherwise, God will reveal that also to you. Only let us hold true to what we have attained. Paul demonstrates very clearly in this passage, the mindset of reaching forward and I think it's the mindset that Every Christian Needs to have. And so the first thing that I see Paul doing is that he focuses on the mission. What exactly is he reaching forward to? What is he striving to do in this life? You have this picture of a goal and he is reaching forward to that goal. So what is the goal? What is the mission for Paul and might I say for every Christian? Well, Paul says in verse 11, right before this passage, he says that by any means possible I may attain the resurrection from the dead. Paul's goal was to, to experience the resurrection not just for the sake of experiencing that, but so that he might be with Christ. His goal, if I could summarize this or put it in other words is to be in heaven to go to Heaven, to be with God to be in relationship with God. That's his goal. And notice that he wants this goal so much that he says that by any means possible. And if you'll read the first part of chapter three, you see that Paul was willing to give up many things, in fact, many treasures that he had in his life, he says, I'm actually going to treat that like trash, that no longer has the meaning for me that it once had. And so I'm going to put all that aside, because this one goal is primary. This is what I want more than anything. And Paul's reaching for it, I think, in part because he's able to focus on that goal to focus on that mission. As we come to verse 12, he says, not that I have already obtained this or Morty perfect, but I press on to make it my own. I press on to make it my own. Paul strives here to stay on track, to remember what it is that he is striving for. And he says a couple of things that are pretty interesting here, he says, not that I have ordered already obtained it, you know, if we think that we have arrived, if we think that we've accomplished what we want to accomplish, we're not going to work very hard for that RV. There's this idea of staying hungry. And so we need to remind ourselves that the Christian life, when we become a Christian, that's not the end. That's not the goal, becoming a Christian. That's the start. And so we can't say when we decide to follow Christ, if that was a tough decision, I'm done. Now, we don't, that's not retirement isn't. That's the beginning. That's when we begin to work. And so Paul says, I've not order attained the resurrection from the dead, I've not reached my goal yet. And because of that, I press on, to make it my own. Paul was focused on what he wanted to do on the mission on the goal, he did not lose sight of that. I think that's important to, to notice, and to remember the language here, and he says, But I press on, he's going to use that word a couple of times, Word Press on means to move rapidly and decisively toward an option object to hasten run, or to press on. And so Paul says that I'm pressing on and it carries some, some weight there, that language idea of hastening a being direct, a wanting something and going right after that. It's not a casual word. But Paul says that I press on, Paul is reaching forward because he is focused on the mission. But not only that, but he stays motivated, and he remembers his motivation. In fact, as we read through this passage, there is one phrase that really sticks out to me, as I read it, at least this time, it almost seems out of place. But it's so important to notice. Paul says in verse 12, after he says that I press on to make it my own. He says, because, because Christ Jesus has made me his, what a beautiful statement. Paul is motivated not by accomplishment, all may have been motivated by that before. He's not just trying to get the goal to say that I accomplished something I checked it off with, but we see here a focus on relationship. He wants to attain to the resurrection from the dead so that he can be with God. And notice the language. He says, because he has made me his own. Paul recognizes that he is a child of God. That is his motivation. And that's important because a lot of people talk a lot about faith and works. And does Paul think those things contradict? And I would say not at all. Paul, very clearly in the first part of this chapter says that it's by God's grace and by faith in Christ and what He has done. That is what say,

Jeremy Sweets  09:36
yet he continues to work here and some of the languages of stringent diligent work as Paul think we don't need to work. Now. He says, No, we work but we do that because we are the child of God, not in order to be saved or earn our salvation, but because we are God's child and I think that's a beautiful statement. In business, the best bosses are those that have a relationship with those under them. And the workers want to do their best because of what the they think of their boss or the respect they have for him. On a sports team, a coach, many players will play harder for the coach that they know and love. And so they play for their teammates, they recognize they are part of something larger, and they play for their coach. In a family, we do things many times that we don't want to do, because that's our family. And so we are motivated in part by relationship. And Paul is motivated by his relationship with Jesus Christ. He was working diligently, he says, because Christ has made me his own. And I think that's a beautiful thought and one we need to carry with us. We can reach forward like Paul, because we belong. Because we are loved, because we are a child of God. That motivated Paul, and I think that it should motivate us as well. Paul reached forward, in part because he believed that he needed to remove obstacles, remove obstacles, all says brothers, I do not consider that I have made it my own. I've not completed the goal, have not attained the resurrection from the dead. But one thing I do forgetting what lies behind. We've seen already in Philippians chapter three, if we'd read through that chapter that Paul says that, that if anyone's to boast about fleshly accomplishments or pedigree, Paul says, I'm at the front of the line. If anyone can boast, it's me. Paul says that I'm a Hebrew of Hebrews. He was trained in the law, he was a Pharisee, of the strictest sect of the Jews. And he was he displayed his zeal, his devotion by being a persecutor of the church, Paul went all out. This was not a hobby for him something he did one night a week. This was Paul's life. And Paul says that if anyone could brag about being a Jew, I could. But Paul says later in this passage, that's really, I put all those things behind me. And he expresses that earlier in Philippians, three that that I have to push all that to the side, that is not what makes me righteous before God. It is not my pedigree, it is not my accomplishment in the Jewish faith. So he says one thing I do, forgetting what lies behind Paul was willing to, as he says, earlier, whatever gain I had I counted as loss for the sake of Christ. And we see that in verse eight. Think I have that right? Well, I've lost my birth, but you have to find it yourself. Paul says whatever I did, I I counted as loss for the sake of Christ. And so we see that Paul was committed, Paul was committed. But when it comes to his faith and reaching forward, he did not rely on his past that he says, I need to put all that behind me. Paul did not live in the past and he did not allow us past to keep him from moving forward. Verse eight, is that right? Tearing terraces Alright, so Paul did not live in the past, and he did not allow us pass to keep him from moving forward. He did not allow obstacles to get in his way. You know, many times we allow our pasts to get in our way don't. Sometimes we think that I can't live this Christian life or I can't live this way, because I'm simply inferior. Well, Paul already addressed that I

Jeremy Sweets  14:09
think Paul recognized that he was the cheapest of sinners. He uses that language. And I think he had regret over the life that he lived. But what did he say? He says, Christ has made me his own. Paul didn't have a sense of inferiority because he knew that he was loved by God, that he was a child of God. And so if we have a sense of inferiority, we need to understand that we're loved by God, we need to put that behind us. Sometimes we feel a sense of shame for our sin and we should feel shame for sin. But sometimes, even when we're forgiven, we bring back up the shame of our sin and we need to realize that sins can be wiped from our record, our sins can be forgiven by God. And if God can forgive us our sins, we We need to forgive our selves in a sense, we need to be able to put that behind us and move forward. It may be that we're on the other side of things where we're not feeling bad about what's in the past, but maybe we're feeling good about what's in the past. I mean, look at all the things I've done. I've accomplished an awful lot. But the truth is that, despite our accomplishments, we've sinned in the sight of God, and we're worthy of death, we don't need to be too proud. Whatever it is, we need to put the things in the past in the past and turn the corner on those things, forgetting what lies behind. And so we need to put those things in the past just like Paul did, and reach for remove obstacles, anything in our way, anything that would hinder us. We also say that Paul says that we need to be diligent, we need to be disciplined. He uses the language of straining to what lies ahead. So we're not focused on the past, our body is not looking to the past, but rather we are straining forward. If we want to get to the goal will not do well by going backwards will, will not do well by looking backwards. But instead, we need to be looking toward the goal and straining toward it. This language again shows the severity of what's involved. It is it is a to exert oneself to the uttermost, to stretch out or strain as it's defined. The word conveys diligence and hard work. There is a strain, a strain, you ever strain a muscle, you used it too much, right? And you may strain a muscle hey, here's this idea of he's given everything that he's got. It's from extreme exertion. It's with great difficulty in the work. That is how much Paul desires this goal he is seeking after to do the work of the Lord. And so he says that I am straining for what lies ahead. Again, I'll remind us, there is no contradiction in Paul's mind between living a life of faith and being a diligent worker. He believes in being a diligent worker, and so should we, we live by faith, we're saved by faith in Christ Jesus and the blood that was shed for us and our trust in Him, we can't earn our salvation. But Christians should be diligent workers, those that are straining after the prize. And I also want to point out the fact that this is not a one time occurrence, either. Some people when they set their goals, they want to work out, maybe they've never worked out in their life before. And they strain themselves and say, I'm done with that. That's not the kind of straining that we do as Christians, a one time worker. This is a constant work that we are to give to God. And so we should be not only diligent, but disciplined as well. So that we continue on. We also need to keep the goal in mind in verse 14, Paul says, I press on toward the goal for the prize of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus. Notice already we've seen that vision is important here. Notice the importance of vision and Paul's mindset, he says that I'm not going to be looking back, but instead I'm going to be straining forward. And as he is reaching forward, I think we have a clear indication of his vision. He is pressing on toward the goal. That's where his eyes are, since that's what motivates him.

Jeremy Sweets  18:59
He's not looking back. I don't even think he's looking down. You know, sometimes we can be busy doing the things of the Lord, that we forget really what it's all about. I've got to get to church, I've got to go, I've got to, I got to read my Bible. I've got to do all of this. And we're looking down. But we're not have our heads up looking to Jesus looking to the goal, looking at why we're even doing all this. And so we can be busy in the Lord's work and failed to keep the goal in mind. I think that Paul pressed on toward the goal and kept the goal in his mind. He kept his eyes on the prize in Hebrews chapter 12. He uses the analogy of running a race. And he says let us run with endurance the race that is set before us. And then in verse two, he says, looking to Jesus, and that's the way to run the race, isn't it? Looking forward, looking to the finish line? striving for the finish line, so that we can get there, we need to keep clear vision. And remember our primary goal, you know, it's paramount that we do that it's a primary importance that we keep the goal in mind. You know, there are there are businesses, and they say that it's really good for a business to define their their mission statements. And that when the business starts, it's easy to remember why they started, why they're in business in the first place. But it's over time, that a business or an organization, any any group of people to get gathers together for a purpose, over time, they can begin to forget what exactly it is they're doing. And again, they can get lost in the details of the business. They may have new opportunities, they'll take them in a different direction. And so they need to define, wait a minute, what is it that we are trying to do? And Christians need to do the same thing constantly? Because we can look Oh, Satan has offered me some more opportunities over here, I've got my head down, I forgot. Why is it that I'm even doing what I'm doing. And so we need to be filled with that mission, we need to have the goal in mind, we need to be looking forward. And we need to know why we're doing what we're doing. Paul says I press on toward the goal. And I believe he kept that firmly in his mind's eye. And so the approach here is one of of looking forward and looking for this goal. Notice that Paul also says that you need to change your lifestyle, maybe I have this idea of goals in my mind. You know, when you're making a goal, you may well know that most resolutions fail. No, it's a great idea to to lose 100 pounds and get a college degree in a few weeks. And you know, it's a wonderful thing to think about all the great things that could happen. But if you're to really make something, make a change, it's not going to happen by living your life and then adding a simple change on top. It really requires a lifestyle chain. It requires a different mindsets, knows what Paul says in verse 15, let those of us who are mature think this way. If you really want to attain a resolution, you say I want to make this change, you're going to have to think different, you're going to have to make it a part of the way that you live, it's going to have to be so much a part of you that that that changes ingrained into who you are. It's not going to be simply something you put on top, it's not going to be something that's extra. Paul says the mature think this way. What way is that I think what we've been talking about straining forward, forgetting what lies behind looking for the goal of the prize. As we grow in Christ, I hope that we green gain a clearer vision of what it is we're doing and why we're doing it. As we grow in our maturity, I hope we are reminded of what truly is important, and what truly is not. And so we must strive to live a Christian life, to make it part of our lifestyle of who we are. And not just some extras, church attendance, Bible reading, those are all vital and important, but they can be just extras, if you're not living the life of a Christian if your heart is not changed. And so let's not let them be extras, but rather part of who we are.

Jeremy Sweets  23:57
We also see in verse 16, that Paul says that we simply need to stay the course. He says only let us hold true to what we have attained. Let us hold true to what we have attained. You know all the resolutions, plans and techniques for accomplishing goals will not amount to anything. Unless you stay the course. Reaching forward requires a diligence. It requires work requires persistence. You ask why most people fail to keep the resolutions. I think that's it right there. It's nice to think about great changes, but it's hard to do. And it's nice to think about being more godly and it's nice to think about having greater Bible knowledge but it requires work and diligence and persistence to actually do those things. But that's what we are called to do and to be as Christians. We are to be diligent workers, and so it might be nice to picture Better you, but are you willing to do the work to get there? Are you willing to strain? Are you willing to persist even when they're setbacks? Or when there's trials? Or maybe when you take a step back, if you take a step back in your life as a Christian, you say, Well, it's time to throw in the towel. It's time to give up, or do you continue on? You have to desire it more than the pain you feel the difficulty that you experience. We have to desire, what all desire to be in heaven with God. There has to be a stick to it to this. I couldn't do that again, stick to itiveness. I tried. I guess I did it better the second time. All right, you have to hold on. The Christian life requires staying the course and running the race within urines. I think Paul displays many great qualities and attitudes of what it means to reach for. If we're to make goals and make resolutions, there's nothing wrong with that. There's nothing required of that. But let us not forget God, if we're to make those resolutions are those goals. I think there's many spiritual goals that we need to make as we reach forward in 2020. We need to read Scripture regularly. Mike mentioned that this morning about having a regular Bible reading program. And let me encourage you to do that. Read your Bible on a regular basis. It's a great goal to read the entire Bible. But if you if that's too much for you don't give up and say I can't do anything, do something to read in God's word daily. There are there are plans that are less ambitious than the whole Bible, although I do recommend that, but do something Read, read regularly. Pray on a regular basis, we need to be talking to Almighty God, the Creator of the universe on a regular basis. It is amazing that we have that privilege, let us take advantage of it. Let us grow in our our character, our our patience, or endurance, or strength, or kindness, or love, charity, perseverance, let us grow in our character. Let us overcome sin and sin is still continuing and persisting let us work to overcome those things. Let us confess our sins to others. Let us talk to the elders or others that are wiser about the difficulties or challenging challenges that we're facing. Let us reach out to our brothers and sisters in Christ. But the point is do something about it. Don't just say well, that's who I am. You know, I'm just the sinner. So no big deal. It is a big deal. We're going to strain forward to heaven, then we're going to try to overcome sin that persists in our life. What about encouraging others, let's make goals maybe I'm going to reach out to somebody from the congregation or, or those that are older, or whoever it is reach out and encourage on a regular basis. We need to strive to teach others. We have a family that's the perfect starting place. Have a Family Bible Study, teach your kids have regular times of instruction. We need to teach others as well, including evangelizing and spreading the gospel, let us reach forward. And 2020. me mention one other thing about resolutions. Again, many people make them.

Jeremy Sweets  28:45
And there's not a problem with that. But let me just suggest that we keep what's foremost in our minds, and that is getting to heaven. So let us not lose sight of that. So if you're going to decide that you want to lose some weight, there's really nothing wrong with making that decision. But I hope you understand that the primary goal is getting to heaven. So let's see it in that context. So if you're going to, if you're going to feel better physically, that can be a good thing. But do that with the goal of mind that you are to serve God physically. And you'll use your body in the service of God. So it's not just losing weight to lose weight or, or whatever you're exercising for exercise in the sake maybe we could consider that our primary goal is to get to heaven and everything else should be subservient to that. So you can make some physical goals, financial goals, other the other things like that prepare for retirement, those things are not bad. They're not required. But whatever you do, do all things to the glory of God and do all things so that you can get to heaven. I hope that we don't have a bunch of physical goals and Then we forgotten that our primary goal is to get to heaven. So let's put that at the top. Let's train for that first and foremost, and everything else should fall underneath that. Let us strive forward, reach forward this year. I know I needed this lesson. I hope that was helpful and beneficial for you as well. If you're not a Christian, and you're here you have an opportunity to obey the gospel message. If you're listening online, you have an opportunity to obey the gospel message believing that Jesus is the Christ, repenting of your sins, confessing Jesus Christ and being baptized in the water for forgiveness of your sins. If you are a Christian and you're not living as you should you need to make changes right now. honor the commitment that you made when you became a Christian and make changes and corrections if you need to do that. If there's any subject to the invitation, please come as we stand and seen at this time
