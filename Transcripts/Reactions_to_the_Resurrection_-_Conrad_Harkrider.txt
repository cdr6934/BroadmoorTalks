Good morning, if you want to open up your Bibles to Mark the 16th chapter, Mark chapter 16.

Unknown Speaker  00:39
Just thinking about this time a year ago,

Conrad Harkrider  00:41
we were worshiping on Easter Sunday at our homes, with our families. And there was just a few that were here at the building that were organized with the service. But it's just so great to be back together, even if it's in a limited capacity with the group still split. But it's great to see each of you here. For those who are visiting, we're glad you're able to come and be with us. What is the most significant event that has happened during your lifetime? That was a question that the Pew Research Center asked Americans back in 2016. And what they found was that there were a lot of similar responses. Over 76% of those who were asked, came back with one of the same events, and their list of top 10. They asked people from all different backgrounds, different ethnicities, they asked different age groups, Baby Boomers, Gen X millennials, and over three quarters of them had this one event listed as one of the most significant things that happened in their lifetime. The terrorist attacks on 911. Some of the others that were in that top 10 was the JFK assassination, the Vietnam War, and the election of President Obama. I imagine that if they asked Americans again in 2021, about the most significant event that there would be a new one in the top 10, perhaps number one, the pandemic certainly has been one of the most dramatic things ever faced in our generation. But this morning, I'd like for us to think about another historical event. Something that I believe is the greatest event in all of human history, something that changed the course of the world. Christianity is founded upon the resurrection of Jesus Christ, that claim that Jesus was crucified that he died, he was buried and after three days, he rose from the grave that is the essential foundation of our faith. If those claims are false, if it's not true that Jesus was raised from the dead, then Christians have been misled for 1000s of years, by the greatest hoax and lie ever conceived. But if it is true,

Conrad Harkrider  03:36
if Jesus was in fact raised, if the tomb was empty, then the things that are written in this book are real. And Jesus is who he said he was. The resurrection was an event that is based in history. It happened in a real place outside of Jerusalem, there were real people that were involved, punches Pilate, the governor who sins, Jesus to death. That's someone from history we can read about outside of the Bible. And there are a number of eyewitnesses who saw these things unfold in real time. But as we're going to see this morning, not all of them felt the same way. Not all of them had the same response to the things that they witnessed. There were a number of different reactions to the resurrection. And so I like to look at some of those this morning that are described in the Gospels and for us to consider this incredible event from history. Read with me and Mark chapter 16, beginning in verse one. It says Now when the Sabbath was passed, Mary Magdalene, Mary, the mother of James, and Salome brought spices But they might come and anoint him. Very early in the morning on the first day of the week, they came to the tomb when the sun had risen. And they said among themselves, who will roll away the stone from the door of the tomb for us. But when they looked up, they saw that the stone had been rolled away, for it was very large. And entering the tomb, they saw a young man clothed in a long white robe sitting on the right side, and they were alarmed. But he said to them, Do not be alarmed. You see Jesus of Nazareth, who was crucified, He is risen, he is not here, see the place where they laid him, but go and tell his disciples and Peter that he is going before you into Galilee, there you will see him as he has said to you. So they went out quickly and fled from the tomb, for they trembled, and were amazed. And they said nothing to anyone, for they were afraid. Notice that one of the first reactions to the resurrection of Jesus was fear. These women in March chapter 16, go to the tomb of Jesus on the first day of the week, as the sun is beginning to rise. They were his devoted followers. They wanted to do something to show their care, their love their concern for him. So they take spices and these fragrant oils and they go to anoint his body just show him honor and respect Jesus had been put to death. And the most publicly humiliating way to die on a cross was a shameful and disgraceful death. But these women go to show their honor and respect through this humble act of kindness. This passage describes several surprises that they encounter, as they get as they went to the tomb on that early on that early Sunday morning. The first surprise is in regards to the stone. Notice verse three, I love the way what Mark says here, he gives us some insight into what they were thinking. Verse three says, Who will roll away the stone? For us? This is what they're, they're talking about, as they're on their way to the tomb, and thinking about, well, how are we going to get that stone out of the way so we can get inside to the body of Jesus.

Conrad Harkrider  07:49
And as they approach, they come up on their first surprise, verse four says that the stone had been rolled back not something that they were expecting, but now there is a way in to the tomb. As they go into the tomb, there is their second surprise. Another shocking thing for these women to witness instead of seeing the body of Jesus, decaying and decomposing, they are instead met by a person Mark describes as a young man dressed in white clothes. But this is no ordinary person. Matthew chapter 28, in verse three says that this was an angel, that His appearance was like lightning, the appearance of lightning, we've had some intense storms here in Tennessee over the last several weeks. If you've looked outside, during the night, you may have seen the flashes of lightning going across the sky, the thunder and the sound of the storm. That lightning is so powerful, it can light up an entire dark sky from one end to the other. It booms for a moment, and then it's gone. But can you imagine standing in the presence of someone who had the appearance of lightning, verse five says that when they saw him they were alarmed, rightfully so. They were shocked. They were amazed. Verse six, the angel says do not be alarmed. And then he announces the greatest surprise, the greatest shock of all he says that Jesus is risen. Jesus is not dead. But he is alive. He tells the women to go and share this news with the disciples and with Peter. And notice verse eight, Verse eight says, so when they went out quickly and fled from the tomb They trembled. And they were amazed. They were physically shaken by this. They are astonished at the end of verse eight says that they said nothing to anyone because of their fear. Their reaction to the news about Jesus being raised was fear. That fear caused them to lock up to not speak or say anything to anyone. We see a similar reaction by the disciples in John chapter 20 And verse 19. It says, On the evening of that day, the first day of the week, the doors being locked, where the disciples were for fear of the Jews, Jesus came and stood among them and said to them, Peace be with you. After the disciples have heard about Jesus being raised, where do they go? into a closed off? Locked? Room? They are afraid. Why would the news about the resurrection cause someone to be fearful? Obviously, these women have seen something that is supernatural. It's not every day that you encounter someone who is dressed in clothes like the appearance of the sun. Wouldn't they be full of excitement? overwhelming joy,

Conrad Harkrider  11:29
and praise to hear the news of Jesus being raised up. I think there's something going on here something that affects us even today. And that is that if Jesus has been raised, what does that mean? What does that? What are the what's the impact? What are the implications of Jesus being raised, these women were firsthand. First, firsthand I witnesses of the power of God, real power. The Bible is not just a book of stories about good life lessons. And God is not just a made up being written by some men who put this down in a book he is real. His power is real. And the resurrection shows us that God is tremendously powerful. And Romans chapter one, in verse four, it says, he was declared to be the Son of God and power, according to the spirit of holiness, by His resurrection from the dead, Jesus Christ, our Lord, when someone comes face to face with that power. It, it shakes you, it moves you to your core, even as we reflect on that 2000 years later, it can cause us as we sung this morning to tremble, to think about the awesome power of God, His ways are so much higher and greater than ours. But there's also another aspect to it, these women and the disciples must have been thinking, what does this mean for my life? How is this going to change my direction? My course? How will people see me? Will I be in danger? Will there be a threat to my life, what is going to happen? From here on out, the disciples must have felt a sense of pressure, if they take this step to to follow the Lord, how's that going to affect the rest of their life? That was a scary thought. And so it is today when we come to Christ. There are real world consequences. There are things that happen when we accept Jesus, giving up a relationship, putting away a simple habit, deciding to live a life of service, rather than seeking our own interests. That is going to require effort and change. And sometimes that can cause people to have great fear to be afraid of what's going to come in the future. These women left the the tomb of Jesus that morning, in fear. But as we'll notice here in a moment, they didn't stay there. They didn't stay there. We'll also notice a reaction to the resurrection was disbelief. Look at Matthew chapter 28 And verse 11. Matthew chapter 28, and verse 11. Matthew gives us some insight into some of the things that were happening after Jesus was raised among the Jewish leaders, Matthew 28, and verse 11. It says, now why They were going to hold some of the guard came into the city and reported to the chief priests, and all that had all the things that had happened. And when they assembled the elders and consulted together, they gave a large sum of money to the soldiers saying, Tell them His disciples came at night and stole him away while we slept. I want you to notice verse 11. The guards who are there at the tomb watching over it, it says that they came and told the chief priests, all the things that had happened. They told them every thing that they had seen in Matthew chapter 28, it describes a great earthquake that occurred on that morning, when the angel of the Lord came down out of heaven. When the guards saw him, they were so afraid, verse four says that they shook like dead men. They saw the angel, these guards saw the stone being rolled back from the to.

Conrad Harkrider  16:16
And they looked inside, and saw an empty grave site. And they went and told those things to those who had commissioned them, the chief priests, they told them, everything. And the response from these leaders, their reaction when they heard this amazing account from the soldiers who presumably are an impartial source, they have no reason to make this story up. They're not trying to bolster the claims of the disciples. And yet, when they hear this, this account from the soldiers, they did not believe. Instead, they come up with a plan to bribe these men. They tell them to lie about this to say that his disciples came and stole the body away. Sometimes we think that if God would just do a miracle today that people would believe, if God would just send a prophet in our day, and he could do a sign for people to see come into Nashville and have the man walk across the Cumberland River do something that people had never witnessed before, then everyone would repent, and they would believe. But no matter how many signs or miracles, God says, no matter how many earthquakes, he brings, as he did at the resurrection, people still have a choice. They can choose whether they are going to open their eyes and see what God is doing. Or they can turn away. In Mark chapter three, there was a man who had a withered hand who went into the synagogue on a Sabbath day. And Jesus happened to be there. At that same time. The Pharisees knew that Jesus could do miracles, they had seen the great things that he had done, and now they were watching him, they wanted to see if he would heal a man on the Sabbath day. Jesus healed the man. In a March chapter three, in verse five, it says that he looked around at them with anger, grieved at the hardness of their heart and said to the man stretch out your hand, and he stretched it out and his hand was restored, Jesus was upset, he was grieved at the hardness of their heart. They had become so callous, so stubborn that they could not even see the power of God that was right in front of them, they cared more about their status, about their own position than they did in seeing the truth. There's a lot of disbelief in our world today. Many of the greatest minds the most well respected scholars affirm that there is no god that there was nothing special about Jesus, he was just an ordinary man. But there are some facts that skeptics cannot dispute. First of all, Jesus was a real person. He is a man of history. Second of all, Jesus's disciples believed that he was raised from the dead. We see those claims early on in the Gospels and in the writings of Paul. The early Christians believed that Jesus had been raised And third, the disciples were willing to die for that claim. They were willing to be put to death for those convictions. Why would they do that? And how were they able to convince people throughout the whole world to accept these claims? Does the evidence point to some great hoax or is there validity to these claims, there will always be those who scoff and ridicule the idea of a resurrection. But God is looking for those who have honest and open hearts who are willing to consider the evidence that is before us. Another reaction to the resurrection was doubt. In Matthew chapter 28, in verse 16, Matthew 28, in verse 16, as Jesus gives the Great Commission to His disciples, He says, then the 11 disciples went away into Galilee, to the mountain which Jesus had appointed for them. And when they saw him, they worshipped Him. but some doubted.

Conrad Harkrider  21:17
After Jesus was raised from the dead, he went to Galilee, to present himself to the 11 disciples, Judas had taken his own life. But the other 11, were still there. And when they saw him, the text says that they worshipped Him. They realized that this was one who had incredible power, he had the power over sickness to heal people, and their diseases, get power over the elements, he could tell the wind and the waves to be still. And now they are seeing firsthand that he has power over the grave. But notice what it says at the end of verse 17, but some doubted. They had heard the reports of Jesus being raised we know from other Gospel accounts, Luke's Gospel that he had appeared to them before this in Jerusalem. But now they are seeing him face to face. So why would they doubt? Why would they have resurrect reservations about this? Well, perhaps, perhaps it was because his appearances were unexpected. They didn't know when he was going to be among them. They were sporadic in nature. There were some occasions where Jesus was not recognizable. The two men on the road to Emmaus didn't even know that they were walking along with Jesus and Luke 24. Maybe it was because some time had passed from when they first saw him until now. And so doubts had started to creep into their minds. Was that real? Did we just make that up? But whatever the case, this verse highlights that even the disciples who saw Jesus had reservations, they were unsure if this was real, probably the most well known account of doubting, and second guessing is from Thomas, we even refer to him as Doubting Thomas and John chapter 20. He told the other disciples that unless I put my finger into his hand, to the nail prints in my hand in his side, I will not believe John tells us that after Thomas said that, eight days passed, until he finally got his opportunity. And in John chapter 20, verse 29, it says, Have you believed because you have seen me, this is Jesus speaking. He said, Blessed are those who have not seen, yet have believed there are only a select group of people that had the opportunity to see Jesus after He was raised. But for the multitudes for the scores of people who have believed based upon that testimony, Jesus says, They are blessed. Why do we doubt things that we know are true? Why do we question beliefs? That at one time seems so plain, so clear to us? I think one reason is that we live in a pessimistic society. The old phrase, If it sounds too good to be true, it probably is we question whether something could actually improve. We put limits on God's power and what He can do. We look at a person we think they're never going to change. We see a church and we say, they're never going to grow. We look at our own trouble or situation. And we think I can never overcome this, I can never move past this. And we defeat ourselves. before we've even started. We often allow doubt to come into our hearts when we take our eyes off of our goal, what we're focused on. Last week, I had the kids at the house by myself, Mom was away. And I was getting them ready for bed, I got them all bathed in in pajamas. without anyone getting seriously injured. I felt like we were on the right track. They were doing well. And I got my phone out to check a few messages just for a couple of minutes. The next thing I know the two year old comes back into the room. And he's got this white stuff all in his hair. It almost looks like lotion. And I asked him, What are you doing, and he says I forgot to do my conditioner.

Conrad Harkrider  26:21
Needless to say, he got to say he got to take bath. Number two. When we take our eyes off of the goal, when we get distracted, we lose our focus that can cause our faith. To get off track, we start to move in the wrong direction instead of holding on to our convictions. We begin to waver when Peter got out of the boat. He was walking on the water, he was doing something that no other person had ever done before. But then he started to look around him started to see the wind the waves, and it caused him to doubt the Lord wants us to hold on to his hand to trust him, no matter what we face, in times of blessing during periods of adversity, never doubting his faithfulness, and his protection. Finally, notice, Luke chapter 24, verse 50, through 53, we see the final reaction to the resurrection was joy. Luke chapter 24, verse 50, as Jesus is about to be taken back up into heaven and leave his disciples, entrusting them with the work that was set before them, and taking the gospel to the world. Notice what he says. Notice what's said in Luke chapter 24, verse 50, and he led them out as far as Bethany and lifted up his hands and bless them. Now it came to pass while he blessed them that he was that he was parted from them and carried up into heaven. And they worshipped Him and return to Jerusalem with great joy. And we're continually in the temple, praising, and blessing God, the disciples had back to Jerusalem filled with this great joy. They are no longer huddled together in a locked room. They are no longer fearing what the Jewish leaders might do to them. But instead, verse 53, says that they were found in the temple in a public place, continually blessing God. In the book of Acts, we read about how on the day of Pentecost, they receive the power of the Holy Spirit. And Peter and the other disciples stood up and boldly proclaimed the resurrection of Jesus, even after being arrested in Acts chapter five and verse 41. It says, they left the presence of the council rejoicing that they were counted worthy to suffer dishonor, for the name. They went from being afraid from being scared from being locked inside of a room to now rejoicing at the opportunity to suffer to be punished for the sake of Christ. How can we go from that sense of fear of apprehension to this attitude, this mindset of joy, we can have joy because the resurrection puts everything into perspective. It gives us perspective and helps us place things in their proper position. After our first child was born, we had to spend a few nights in the hospital. And I remember one day I went back to the house to get a few things and when it came back up to the hospital. I was like a little giddy kid, I was so excited. We just had this new baby and I was getting to go and, and see her again and hold her. And I remember getting into the elevator. And there was another person that was also there at the hospital either visiting someone, and they just made the comment or said hello. They said, Well, how are you doing? And I responded with, I'm doing great. And they kind of looked at me like, you don't realize you're at a hospital right now. This is not exactly the place where people are excited to be here. But the point was, I was focused on something else. I was thinking about that little blessing that I was going to see that was there waiting for me.

Conrad Harkrider  30:51
When we become a child of God, we receive this incredible blessing, the forgiveness of sins. And even though we continue to live in a place that's very sad and difficult, and filled with lots of challenges. We have hope of one day being resurrected to life. And that should cause us immeasurable joy. The things that we face in this life, just difficulties, disappointments, setbacks, those things pale in comparison to this blessing that God has offered to us through His Son, it's a joy, that can't be taken away. No matter what happens to us. No one can ever take our joy. You may lose your job. But Jesus is still risen. You may lose your house, but Jesus is still risen. You may lose someone that is close to you. But Jesus is still risen. And one day all of us will lose our lives. But Jesus is still risen. First Peter chapter one and verse six says in this you rejoice, though now for a little while, if necessary. You have been grieved by various trials. Do you have that joy, that hope, that assurance that only comes by being a child of God by being one of his disciples. And if you're not a Christian this morning, we want to encourage you to take that step to submit your life to Christ, to repent of your sins, to be baptized to have your sins completely washed away. So that you can share in the joy and the hope of the resurrection and there's something that we can do to encourage or support you this morning. Please come down to the front as we stand and see
