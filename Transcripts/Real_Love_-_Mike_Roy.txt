But it's such a blessing to have an opportunity to come and worship our Great and Holy God and Heaven sing the songs that we've sung this morning. Appreciate those songs, everything that you lead force this morning. I used to say a long time ago, that if I didn't say anything else this morning we have, we have glorified God, we've been built up in our faith and these songs are deeply stir my emotions. So I appreciate again, those songs ever in the Lord's Supper talk this morning, Jeremy the prayers, it's an opportunity to praise God, and to remind ourselves that God's greatness and His love knows he knows no limits. His love is amazing. And with that in mind, and speaking on the issue of love, you know, we throw that word around kind of loosely in our society. We say things like, I love my wife, love my children. Love My brethren. I love apple pie and ice cream, and I love baseball. Well, surely we understand that we don't mean the same thing. We don't love each of these equally. But we use that word love true love, real love. Sometimes young people do that when they think they're madly in love, and that they feel like they found their true love or they're really in love. But so often, much in time, what we call real love. True love is based on a lot of emotions and feelings. And it's not the kind of love that we read about in the Bible. And while the Bible doesn't use the phrase true love. It certainly describes what true love really is in first Corinthians chapter 13, which provides us a template of what love looks like in the songs that we sang this morning illustrated probably better than I can see myself. And what we learn from Scripture is that love is a choice. Love is a choice is not an emotion, it's a choice is active goodwill to somebody else. So true. True love is selfless, in places the needs of another person above their own. Real love is intentional, and chooses what is best for another person. And this is the type of love that we need, especially at this time. Throwing is this pandemic is kind of winding down. And I want to say we appreciate the love that is displayed by all of you here at the Broadmoor family. This is the quality that we want to develop in our lives. And so this morning, maybe an appropriate lesson as we face some challenges in our culture and our world, especially as in connection with this pandemic that we have been dealing with for over a year. We look at the question what is real love or what is true love. And we'll be looking at first Corinthians chapter 13, verses four through seven. So let's let's look there, I'm going to have these scriptures on the screen. Feel free to look at first Corinthians chapter 13 in your Bible. But this is just basic Bible teaching Bible preaching from a text of Scripture that tells us what real love is all about. And we just sang a couple of those songs that remind us that love is enduring his patient is hopeful and it doesn't give up. So let me just by way of quick overviews, show you what we want to talk about this morning. And then go through this lesson make some applications for our lives. So first things first Corinthians chapter 13. In the first three verses, Paul basically says that the greatest gifts and knowledge and sacrifices that we can make mean nothing without love. Now think about that for just a moment. The greatest gifts, knowledge and sacrifice to mean nothing without love. Secondly, then we'll be looking at the nature and the character of real love and verses four through seven. And then the third section is basically Polish showing the supremacy of real love over miraculous gifts. Oftentimes we value the the things that are great, like miracles or miraculous gifts, certainly the Corinthians value tongue speaking and things like that. And Paul just says that real love is supreme, over all the greatest gifts that a person can have. And so that's what we want to look at this morning. So I've broken the chapter down into three sections. So the first point I'm making, again, which shows us the power and the importance of love of real love, we're talking about real love or true love because we throw those words around kind of loosely, but the greatest gifts that you might have the greatest amount of knowledge that you have been given from God and sacrifices that we that we can make me nothing. Nothing without love.

Mike Roy  04:48
Think about that. So first Corinthians chapter 13. In verses one through three, no take these verses one of the time Paul says if I speak in the tongues of men and of angels by have not loved I'm an I am a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal. Sometimes that last part describes some some of my melodies when I sang but but the text is a very serious situation he's talking about tongues tongues, we're, we're miraculous languages that people did not study to gain that. So speaking with the tongues of men would be significant to speak to the tongues of angels. What would the tongues of angels sound like? Well remember in second Corinthians chapter 12, verse four, Paul was caught up in his vision, and into paradise. And he heard things that were not permissible for a human being to utter that Paul is seems heard the tongues of angels, he couldn't even describe it could even talk about that. But Paul says that, that even though a person can do these remarkable things, to do so without love would mean that we sounded like a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal. So if we had those gifts, and the gifts of miraculous tongues, to execute those without love, this is how we would sound to God, if we did it in that fashion. Secondly, he said, If I have prophetic powers, and understand all mysteries and all knowledge, and if I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, but have not love, he said, I am nothing again significant language over here. The gift of prophecy was an incredible, miraculous gift to be able to reveal God's will, to sometimes foretell the future, but mainly to speak God's revelation for His church, especially this time, they in time, an incredible gifts. And then you think about the sort of the phrase if I can you imagine having under or understanding all mysteries, and having all knowledge, I have a little knowledge, sometimes I think I'm smart, maybe you feel the same way. But can you imagine having all knowledge and understanding all mysteries relating to God, about his church in heaven, and eternity, he said, If I have don't have love, he said, I am nothing. It just again elevates the importance of love in our lives. And to realize how much we need to keep that at the center of our thinking. Then he says, If I have all faith, so as to remove mountains, I actually preached about that this last weekend in Chicago. And just by a little commentary, when we were trying to get through this pandemic, and hope we get to the point where we can ditch these masks and everything was the first time for me to speak with a shower curtain between me and the people. And I had my tape my mouth taped to the mask, like, you know, cut some, wait a minute, why don't have to wear a mask and be behind the shower curtain. Anyway, that's for another story. But we need to be patient with each other during this time. But But I talked about the idea that we can have faith to move mountains mountains of difficulty. And again, Paul is saying that if I have this kind of faith, that if I can even move enormous mountains of difficulty, I am nothing finished. By giveaway all I have. And if I deliver it my body to be burned, but have not love, he said I gained nothing. This is sacrificial, extreme hardship that people are the Christians are willing to endure for the sake of the Gospel, by did all these, all these things. Paul says that I gained nothing. So again to the first section of the chapter tells us that the greatest gifts that we might have, and all of the knowledge that we can accumulate, even if it's miraculous knowledge doesn't mean anything, if we don't execute those gifts, and knowledge with love. Secondly, again want to focus on this second section here, which shows us the nature and the character and the character of love and how clearly that's defined and expressed. So again, these are well known verses, appreciate especially the last song that even later we'll focus on that at the end of the section. But But love is a choice. It's an act that is active goodwill, in this passage tells us if we claim to be people of real love, and I believe that we are, if we claim to be people who practice love, then we're going to display these characteristics in our lives. So he said that love is patient.

Mike Roy  09:40
Well, that means that love is going to put up with a lot of frustration and difficulty. The New King James Version says that Love suffers long do you do I do we suffer long or do we not suffer very long? If I'm not patient with my wife My children, my parents are my in laws that I can't say that I really love them. If I'm impatient with other people, then I don't practice. True Love. So Alavi says here is patient. Again, as I've said this a couple times this morning, as this pandemic is winding down, I, I want to commend our congregation here for the patience, and the grace that you've shown to each other. Sometimes preaching is about rebuke, but sometimes it's about praise. And I think we need to be praised. And we appreciate the attitude of the members of this congregation during a very challenging time. And thank you for not putting up a shower curtain might be preached. So hopefully, that'll never have to happen on live but, but love is patient. Love suffers long. Secondly, love is kind. Again, these are qualities that we are we know about, but sometimes we don't think about them like we ought to. But how, how easy is it? To be unkind to somebody else for me to be to my family, or brothers and sisters in Christ? How common is it for some Christian sometimes to be unkind towards other people. And I think we need to be careful. And in our mindset and our attitude, how we interact with family with social media posts, we got to be careful what we say. But kindness is a characteristic of true love. And if I'm not a kind person, that I'm not a person of love, that's powerful. thought to think about. Love isn't jealous. Again, we raised a question Do you struggle with jealousy or envy? Do I certainly to be honest, or sometimes I look at people have more gifts and talents. I wish I was tall, dark and handsome like some of you all. But I have to learn to be accept what God has given me you do the same thing. But it's so easy for us to be jealous of others. I wish I had somebody else's ability to lead singing, I don't have it. And but we have other people who have that gift. So I'm thankful for that. We get you know. So again, it's reminder that one of the characteristics of love is it is not jealous is not envious. And so if we claim to be people who practice real love, that means we're not going to be jealous of others. Love doesn't brag. Again, these are truths that we're familiar with, we just have to be reminded of from from time to time. But how often am I guilty of this? Or how often are you maybe guilty of this when we can boast of our accomplishments, we brag about this and that. Or maybe I just brag about my children, or my grandchildren, whatever the case might be so easy to do those things. And we need to realize that that true love does not brag. And and I know sometimes there's a fine line between sharing information and and with other people. But we have to be careful that we don't boast of our own accomplishments. I love the Guinness song that we sang, I will not boast in anything. But what I'll boast in is Jesus Christ and His death and His resurrection. It's not how many sales I had this year, well, how many jobs were doing, what my degree was in college, or how I did in school, but I will boast in Jesus Christ, and in His death and His resurrection. So true love. If we claim to be people of love doesn't brag. It's not arrogant. And again, when we think about these things, how many of us wrestle with with pride or conceit, and we can look around at other people who don't have it, we have or you have, and we can look down on other other individuals. And we have a sense of arrogance, that somehow I'm better than my person next to my neighbor, there's this poor individual who's on the streets struggling to make ends meet. But true love is not conceited. It's not arrogant. It doesn't look down on others. It doesn't act on becomingly. Again, so when we think about love, the NIV puts it this way, it doesn't dishonor others, how many times do we dishonor somebody else? To love doesn't dishonor anyone, it doesn't act this gracefully. So that means that love is gracious towards the person. And again, you look at the the quality of love, it does not seek its own.

Mike Roy  14:38
Again, we have to ask the question, how often am I looking out for myself? How often? Do I raise the question what's in it for me? Or what do I want to do versus what would be helpful for God's Kingdom real love isn't self focused, it's others focused. And so this is a quality of love. It's not provoked. Again, we raised the question. Do I have a short temper? True love isn't easily angered. It's not irritable. Do you sometimes get irritable with family members, loved ones, brothers and sisters are correct. We all probably do it at different times. But, but true love isn't, isn't provoked is not provoked to anger we exercise self control. Love doesn't take True Love doesn't take into account a wrong suffered. So it doesn't keep a ledger of all the wrongs committed against itself. Course you've heard this illustration. I don't know where I heard this or got this from years ago, a man was talking to his neighbor and saying that, hey, you know, I just talked about the fact that his wife sometimes gets historical with him. And the neighbor says, Well, you mean hysterical? He said, no historical. She recalls every bad thing you've ever done or something like that. And again, I don't know where that that came from. But this passage tells us that true love doesn't keep a record of the wrongs committed against it. How many times do I do that? How many times do each of us do that? So we're talking about real love or true love. And again, it doesn't take this, this record, keep this record doesn't rejoice in unrighteousness, but rejoices with the truth. So again, do we sometimes secretly rejoice in another's downfall, I trust that we don't do that. But sometimes we might do that. But True Love does not rejoice with unrighteousness. It rejoices with the truth. Again, the Bible warns us against gloating over the misfortune of others. And so we need to be reminded of that. And then he comes to the section that last song that Evan led, I think is so powerful. So love bears all things, and it believes all things, hopes all things endures all things. So that tells us then, that love is is again its nature is its patient, its enduring. So the question is for you and for me, do you bear with the weaknesses of others, family members, children, spouses, parents, or grandparents? or brothers or sisters in Christ? Do we bear with those weaknesses? Or do we get angry and irritated at the idiosyncrasies of another family member? Or there's just so many ways that you can illustrate that so blood bears think about this Love bears all things. It another way you can translate till it covers all things. First Peter chapter four verse. I think Verse eight says that love covers a multitude of Sansa love covers everything. Love bears, everything. It keeps every confidence. So again, we read the question, do we find yourself gossiping about others? So again, we're talking about the nature of real love, it bears all things, believes all things. That is it believes the good of the best, and every person How many times am I guilty of not believing the best and other person, or especially in a situation where I might assign some evil motives to a brother's repentance, or something like that. So but love believes all things, it looks at any situation in the best possible light. But as human beings, we can very often not have that mindset mindset. And we question we doubt someone's sincerity, we doubt their commitment, or whatever the case is, but love bears all things, believes all things. Then Paul says that love hopes all things. So this is kind of like a

Mike Roy  18:58
trying to find the word I'm looking for. It's an extension of love each one, it takes the meaning of love to different levels. So even when it doesn't look like for example, a fallen brother is going to turn his life around real hope, real love hopes and prays for his turnaround. So again, what it tells us is that we love bears all things. It believes the best about all people, it hopes all things and and even when it looks like it may be difficult to think that somebody can turn a life around or whatever the situation might be love, hope hoping maybe find yourself in a strained marriage relationship facing challenges or whatever the issue issue might be. But love hopes for improvement and it doesn't give up. And then it says in verse seven that love endures all things. So again, this is a progression on the nature and the strength and the character of Love. So it bears all things, believes all things, hopes all things, endures all things. So even when we don't think we can bear with others failures, and we can't believe the best in another person, and when hope seems to vanish away, true love in doors, when it looks like there is no hope left, as powerful. And I think so the songs that we sing that have especially sung this morning illustrate this truth so well that that that love endures, even when you don't understand, even when things seem hopeless, even when things don't seem to have this any way to find a good situation. love endures all things Job said And Job chapter 13 Verse 15, though he's slay me, yet will I trust him. Some versions put this phrase at this point and some put it on verse eight. But love never fails. Think about that truth. If you write these things down, keep a journal like I do your notebook your your phone, wherever you put that love never fails. And if I would practice love consistently, then I'm not going to fail. As human beings we have certainly of our shortcomings but love does not fail ever. So in verses four through seven shows the nature and the character of love if we claim to be people of real love and have true love, and these are the qualities that we will display in our lives. The third point that I want to mention before we bring the lesson to close this morning is this this section, Paul is showing the absolute supremacy of love over all miraculous gifts. So he said in verse eight, this, the ESP puts it this way, Love never ends. Love, never ancestral prophecies they will pass away as for tongues, they will cease as for knowledge it will pass away, for we know in part and we prophesy in part. But when the perfect comes, the partial will pass away. When I was a child, I spoke like a child I thought like a child, I reasoned like a child. When I became a man, I gave up childish ways. For now we see in a mirror dimly, but then face to face. Now I know in part, then I shall know fully even as I have been fully known up, I'll save the last phrase for just a moment. But in this section, Paul is contrasting the enduring nature of love with the temporary nature of miraculous gifts. And, and so in this particular church in Corinth, they were valuing things like prophecy, and tongues speaking and all that type of thing, and maybe neglecting the importance of love. But it's interesting to me, if you think about this, sometimes you talk about You see, people meet people who claim to have the gift of prophecy, they speak in tongues, and they want to speak in tongues. And I've remember before my conversion visiting a church in near Memphis, Tennessee, and that was the discussion, I wish God would show me a sign. I wish I could speak in tongues. Oh, that I mean, people want that, that seems to be so impressive. And what Paul is describing, though over here is the early period of the church, and these these verses, and basically suggesting that miraculous tongues and prophecy and knowledge, and this is miraculous knowledge. By the way, it is not just knowledge, but it talks about

Mike Roy  23:32
astronomical pathway, so he's talking about all these miraculous gifts. But what he's telling us here is that all of these miraculous gifts were part of the gifts that God gave to His Church to bring knowledge to the early Christians. But once the revelation of God was is complete, then all these impartial and imperfect things would be done away. And so the point that somebody has made in the past that those who want to pursue tongue speaking, and prophecy and other miraculous gifts today, are reverting to the infancy stage of the Lord's church with God's Church. And so, again, as human beings, we oftentimes value miraculous gifts, but the Apostle Paul valued love as a supreme goodness, what he's saying over here, is showing us the absolute supremacy of love. Over all miraculous gifts. Love, never ends and it will never end. So in verse 13, he said, So now faith, hope and love by these three. So he said, these qualities will continue in Paul's life in the life of God's Church, the especially the early church here, said faith, hope and love, but the greatest of these is love. When we see God face to face, we won't need any faith, and we won't need any hope. But love will never go away for all eternity. And so I think the question that we have Want to ask and hope that the lesson is helpful for each of us this morning? Do I practice real love? And I think the challenge is, we understand that and sometimes I do a better job of that. And other times I don't. But when we study God's Word and come together, as we do on a regular basis, it's a challenge to be to be brought back to the standard of Scripture, and to learn what it means to practice love, especially towards God and also towards one another. And as we think about our obedience to the gospel, or need to respond to the gospel of Christ, the number one commandment all scriptures to love the Lord your God with all your heart, mind, soul and strength, and to love your neighbor as yourself. So if you if there's someone here who needs to obey the gospel of Christ, the first thing that you need to do is Love God. Love God with all your heart and put aside all the preconceived ideas and believe that Jesus is the Messiah, repent of your sins as the hard thing for me to do for each of us to do confess your faith in him and then submit the God's command to be immersed in water because that is God's will. And if I love God, I'm going to do His will. But maybe that we said there's someone here that these the prayers of the congregation if there's any way that we can assist you at this time might come forward while we spend to sing this invitation song
