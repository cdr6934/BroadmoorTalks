What do you do when you face some type of obstacle? Or setback? How do you approach adversity or failure? I was listening to an interview recently of Kobe Bryant several years ago. And he was relaying a story about a time when he was 10 or 11 years old. He was playing in a summer league in Philadelphia. The league that he was in had some of the best players in the city in it. And he said that for that entire summer, he did not score a single point. No layups, no free throws, no lucky shots off the backboard, not a single point. He said at the end of the season, his dad took him aside. And he said, whether you score zero points, or 60 points, I'm going to love you the same. He said it was that confidence, and that reassurance that allowed him to stay with it. Kobe Bryant would go on to win five NBA championships. The first of which would happen when he was 21 years old, about 10 years later. He didn't quit after that scoreless summer season, he didn't give up. He continued to move forward. We think about how we approach difficult circumstances in our life and what our response is. And we can look at some really great examples from the scriptures men and women who faced great obstacles, but yet continued to keep their faith in in God. In the book of Nehemiah, we read about one of God's servants who dealt with a number of tremendous challenges. The walls in the city of Jerusalem had been leveled by the Babylonians and 586. And it's Nehemiah who's charged with the task of rebuilding those walls, getting the people back on track, and we see that he encouraged the people in his day to rise up and build to see beyond their current troubles. Let's read together in Nehemiah chapter two beginning in verse one. It says that it came to pass in the month of the sand in the 20th year of King or desert seas, when wine was before him that I took the wine and gave it to the king. Now I had never been sad in his presence before. Therefore the king said to me, Why is your face sad? Since you are not sick? This is nothing but sorrow of heart. So I became dreadfully afraid, and said to the king, May the king live forever? Why should my face not be sad? When the city the place of my father's tombs lies in waste, and its gates are burned with fire. Then the king said to me, what do you request? So I prayed to the God of heaven. And I said to the king, if it pleases the king, and if your servant has found favor in your sight, I asked that you send me to Judah to the city of my father's tombs, that I may rebuild it. Then the king said to me, the Queen also sitting beside him, how long will your journey be? And when will you return? So it please the king to send me and I set him a time. Furthermore, I said to the king, if it pleases the king, let letters be given to me for the governors of the region beyond the river, that they must permit me to pass through till I come to Judah, and a letter to asef the keeper of the kings forest, that he must give me timber to make beams for the gates of the Citadel, which pertained to the temple for the city wall, and for the house that I will occupy. And the king granted them to me according to the good hand of my God upon me.

We're going to look at four different obstacles or challenges that Nehemiah faced and then also notice his response to those challenges. So a challenge, and then a response, the first obstacle come as mentioned here in verse two, look at verse two. It says, Therefore the king said to me, Why is your face sad? Since you're not sick, this is nothing but sorrow of heart. Nehemiah is experiencing this sadness of heart. He's feeling down if you remember that Nehemiah has a very important job. He is the cup bearer to the king. chapter one and verse 11, tells us and the king this ruling over the world at this time is King Arthur Xerxes, the ruler of the Persian Empire, the cup bear was a critical role. He was not only what stood between death and assassination attempt between the king and his food, but he was also an advisor and a counselor to the king. Being in the king's presence required a sense of duty and a certain demeanor that had to be maintained. Nehemiah would have been expected to carry himself in a certain way to be happy and upbeat when serving the king. you've ever seen the soldiers that stand outside of Buckingham Palace, the ones with the tall furry hats and the red coats, what is their demeanor when they're standing? They're very serious, very reserved, you can hardly get them to crack a smile. Nehemiah was not to bring his own personal grievances into the royal court and allow that to affect his service. And notice what he says in verse one. He says that he had never been sad in the king's presence before. So this is a personal burden that he is dealing with that has now impacted his work. This sorrow of heart, this is a serious situation. His job is potentially on the line here the king asks him what's going on and notice in verse three, are at the end of verse two, it says, So I became dreadfully afraid. So Nehemiah is now concerned and worried about this situation trying to answer the king. In verse three, he gives his explanation he speaks. When he does answer the king, he speaks with great prudence, and wisdom. First of all, notice that he complements the king, verse three, he says, Oh, King, live forever. This was a customary way of showing honor or respect to someone who was in a high place. Remember in Daniel chapter six, and verse six, when King Darius goes to the tomb to check on Daniel the morning after he had been thrown into the lions den. And that's the first thing that Daniel says, Oh, King live forever. The second thing that Nehemiah does that is prudent, is that he doesn't mention the city that he's referring to by name. He doesn't say, I need to go and help Jerusalem. Jerusalem was a very controversial city that had a reputation for revolt and rebellion. So he doesn't say the actual name of the city. He's trying to build a case for himself, try to get the Kings favor, and he doesn't want to say or do anything that might sway him one way or the other. The third thing that he does, that's very wise in his response is that he refers to the city as the place of my father's graves. If I said that I am going to visit Shelbyville this weekend. You might have some ideas about that. You may think, well, that's a great place to go and visit. Or you may be thinking, why would anyone go to visit Shelbyville. But if I were to say, well, I'm going to visit my grandfather's grave site. Well, now, you may have more sympathy and compassion for my my circumstance or the way that I'm feeling and especially if I had said, I'm going to visit my grandfather's grave site because it has recently been desecrated or it's been some type of vandalism has been done to it. And so what Nehemiah is doing here is he is trying to build his connection with the King, the Persians and King Artaxerxes. They understood how significant it was to take care of the dead to show honor and respect to those to their fathers. They build elaborate tombs for their kings and So Nehemiah is appealing to something that the king would have understood he would have sympathized with.

Conrad Harkrider  09:55
Well, how does Nehemiah How does he deal with this sadness? have heart. What is his approach? We see that he offers up prayer to the Lord. And chapter one after Nehemiah hears about the great destruction of Jerusalem, there's this beautiful prayer in which he makes intercession for the people he mourns, and weeps for days. He offers a prayer for the sins of the people and for his own sin because they had broken the covenant. But notice some of the dates that are given here in chapter two and verse one, it says that this was in the month of Nissin, or the sun. That was the the first month of the Jewish calendar, which corresponds to our March or April timeframe. But in chapter one and verse one, when the sum of the count, the officials came back from Judea, to report how things were going in the land, and they tell Nehemiah about the walls in the city, and how everything is still burned, and torn down. That happened in the month of Kislev, which was the ninth month. So from the ninth month to the first month, it's been about four months since Nehemiah first heard the report about Jerusalem's walls being broken down. So some time has passed with between when he heard about this. And now when he's going in to make his appeal, before the king will think about how he's feeling here. Have you ever been sad about something not just for a few days, or a few weeks, but for months at a time being overwhelmed with sadness about something.

Conrad Harkrider  11:46
And this is not a an event that is personally affected Nehemiah, he's living in the Capitol, he's 1000s of miles away. He has a good job working in the palace. But yet he feels compassion and pity for his people. We see that Nehemiah doesn't just put this out of his mind, he doesn't just forget about it. It doesn't slip is his memory here. He continues to pray, to mourn and to think about what has happened to God's City and to his people. So he's been thinking about this. He's been offering up prayers to God and now he finds himself in an opportune moment to speak before the king. Notice what he does, in verse four, says in verse four, then the king said to me, what do you request? So I prayed to the God of heaven, seems unlikely that Nehemiah got down on his knees there in the throne room and began praying to God. More likely, this was some type of silent prayer that Nehemiah said to himself quickly asking for the Lord's help and guidance. You know, there's certainly a time and a place for us to go into our prayer room or our quiet place our closet and to bow down before God and to pour out our hearts and our petitions before him. But it's also necessary and needed to speak to the Lord on a regular, consistent, ongoing basis when that moment of temptation hits. Or when we find ourselves in the midst of the trials, we reach out to God asking for his strength. And his guidance Lord, helped me in this situation, give me wisdom. In this situation, Lord helped me to guard my eyes. Lord helped me to have patience with this person. Lord, be with me as I try to speak to this person open their heart helped me to say the right things or have the right approach. Proverbs chapter three, and verse six says that in all your ways, acknowledge Him and He shall direct your pasts. Think about that, to acknowledge God in all of our ways. And one of the ways that we can do that is by constantly connecting with him speaking to him in prayer on an ongoing, regular basis. Nehemiah is pained he has this sorrow of heart for what's happening to the Jewish people. But he understood that this is not a problem that he can solve on his own. He needs the help of the Lord. He needs God's God's strength and when seeking the favor of one of the most powerful men in the world, he offers up this prayer to the Lord. Well, in verse five, Nehemiah requests a leave of absence, he asked the king if he can go back to his homeland, so that he can help with the rebuilding project. But there's another big obstacle in his way because there is a lack of resources. Nehemiah is 1000s of miles. away from Jerusalem. He can't just get on a plane and fly over there or even drive in a car. This is a very hard and difficult journey. Nehemiah has no official title or position over the Jewish nation. He's not the heir apparent to the throne. He's not a governor. He's not a prophet or a judge that's been specially commissioned by the Lord. He is just the cut bear living in Susa. On the other side of the known world, the task at hand is incredibly gifted, incredibly difficult, trying to rebuild the walls of a city, the walls of an ancient city were its lifeline. They were its source of protection, and security. This was a very humiliating and disgraceful thing that the walls had been torn down the place that God had said his name would dwell, the place where his presence dwelt in the temple. This was the holy city, the city of David, is now in complete ruins, just a pile of rubble. And so how is the am I going to make any progress? How is he going to provide assistance to this? He's just one man. How can he possibly help? He has no army, no labor force, no money and no materials. Nehemiah asked the king if he can return. But if he would have stopped there, then who knows how far he would have gotten. But notice what he does. Next, look at verse seven, and eight. It says, Furthermore, I said to the king,

Conrad Harkrider  16:43
if it pleases the king, let letters be given to me for the governors of the region beyond the river, that they must permit me to pass through till I come to Judah, and a letter to ASAP the keeper of the kings forest that he must give me timber to make beams for the gates of the Citadel, which pertains to the temple. And for the city wall, we see that Nehemiah asks for help. The first thing that he gets is like a passport. It provides him with free passage, Royal authorization to travel back into the land of Judah. So all the people on the route commanders, armies, peoples, they won't bother him, give him any trouble and slow him down. The next thing that he requests is a letter to the keeper of the forest, the guy who's got all of the wood and the resources. And now need Nehemiah has secured the materials that he needs for this building project. All because he was willing to ask, because he reached out to someone who was able to help the other day, we were trying to get everybody ready to get out the door, which is always a huge lift at our house. So we're trying to get them dressed. And one of the little ones insisted that they did not need any help from mommy and daddy. I knew that allowing that would quadruple the amount of time it would take but I walked out of the room to just let him give it a try. And when I came back in, he had gotten himself dressed. But both of his legs were in one of the pant legs. And he was hopping around the room like a mermaid. We live in a culture where we want to do things all by ourselves, we want to do it alone. This idea of self reliance and independence, those things are celebrated. We look at a person we say he built that entire house by himself, or she planned and organize the entire event all by herself, as if working alone is somehow better or superior to collaborating and joining together with others. And oftentimes trying to be the one man or one woman show leaves us falling up short and results in us just being tired and overwhelmed. Nehemiah knew that this was not something that he could do by himself, even though he had prayed to God, and now he has the king's favor and permission to return to the land. He doesn't stop there. He continues to secure the things that we're needed to be able to rise up and build. The Lord compares the church and his people to a body, a body with many different members and different parts and pieces that all have an important function and role in First Corinthians chapter 12 And verse 20. It says, As it is there are many parts yet one body, the eye cannot say to the hand I have no need of you nor again the head to the feet. I have no need of you. On the contrary The parts of the body that seem to be weaker, are indispensable. The hand, the eye is dependent upon the hand, it can't function without the hand, the head relies on the feet. You can accomplish some things by yourself, but you will never live up to your full potential. And all that God has intended for you and for us if we don't reach out and ask others for help. And so the application is that if, if I'm thinking about teaching a class, and I'm not really sure how to do that, then reach out and ask someone to assist or to help or to co teach. If you're going to visit or encourage one of the old members, or one of the older members, one of the chatons invite someone else to go with you invite a younger person to accompany you involve other Christians in the good work that you're doing. And don't be afraid to ask for help. In First Peter, chapter five and verse 12.

Conrad Harkrider  21:03
Peter says, with the help of Silas, whom I regard as a faithful Brother, I have written to you briefly encouraging you and testifying that this is the true grace of God, steadfast in it. Peter and Paul were like giants in the early church, they did so much good work, but where would they have been without a good brother like Silas? A man to go alongside them, to help them to strengthen them to encourage them. And so it is for us today, we need to reach out and ask for help. When we face great challenges, when Nehemiah finally makes it back to Jerusalem, look what he does in verse 12, through 13, in verse 12, it says, So then I arose in the night and I in a few men with me, I told no one what my God had put in my heart to do at Jerusalem. Nor was there any animal with me except the one on which I rode. And I went out by night through the valley gate to the serpent well, and the refuge, skate and view the walls of the city and view the walls of Jerusalem which were broken down, and its gates, which were burned with fire. Nehemiah goes out in the middle of the night, he's now gotten back to Jerusalem. And he goes on a reconnaissance mission, really just to go and see surveyed the city to look at all of the damage and see what the walls what condition they're in. And he now encounters his greatest obstacle yet that the walls are torn down. Nehemiah has the permission of the king, he's got the resources, but now he's faced with the actual project to try and rebuild these walls. In verse 14, it says that his animal couldn't even pass through the gate, because there was so much debris, so many rocks, so many stones that were just thrown everywhere that Nehemiah can't even get through one of the gates of the city and so what is he going to do? He doesn't have a bulldozer, or a heavy machinery and trucks to be able to move these things out of the way. How is he possibly going to make any progress with all of these rocks? Well, we see that Nehemiah starts to work toward progress. He works towards progress. Look at verse 17. Nehemiah 217. Then I said to them, you see the distress that we are in how Jerusalem lies in ways and its gates are burned with fire, Come, let us build the wall of Jerusalem that we may no longer be a reproach. And I told them of the Hand of My God, which had been good upon me and also of the King's words they had spoken to me. So they said, Let us rise up and build, then they set their hands to this good work. After seeing the the poor state of the walls, Nehemiah goes to the officials of the people here in verse 17. And he reminds them about how the king has granted them this favor about how God has blessed them. They have gods that God's blessings and he says, Come let us build the walls of Jerusalem. Let us rise up. And Bill Nehemiah is essentially saying we need to get started on this. We can't delay we can't wait any longer. We need to move forward and work toward progress. You think about why Nehemiah was going out in the middle of the night to look at the walls I think it was because he wanted to get a sense of what this project what this work effort was going to to be like. Good leaders don't just assume that everything is gonna work out okay, but instead they plan. They assess they prepare for what's up ahead. In Luke chapter 14 In verse 28. Jesus said that if you want to build a tower You first count the costs, you assess how much you have, so that you'll be able to complete it. So Nehemiah goes and asks the people to join him in this project. And even though there is this incredibly difficult task that's in front of him, Nehemiah is not thinking about all of the challenges, all of the setbacks, the difficulties, those who are opposed to them. But instead, he is positive. He's optimistic, he's focused on moving forward.

Conrad Harkrider  25:37
He is working towards progress. When we moved into our our current house, the backyard had a number of tree stumps that were out there. And so at first, I decided just to pretend like they weren't there. So I'd be mowing the grass, and there'd be a loud thump and bump. And that didn't work out so well. So then I just started to go around them, just try to avoid them. But that slows the mowing down. And it's also difficult to remember where all of those things are. So I started Googling on the internet, how do you get out a stump that has been in the ground for 3040 50 years, especially if you're not going to use any kind of heavy machinery, and what I found out is that you do it very slowly. I would put some holes in it, and then the rain would come. And then I dig out a little piece and then more rain. And slowly but surely, there was progress. So often, when we're trying to improve in some area, we want to see results right now. We want to see the the produce the output, the benefits, whether it's improving our health or learning a new skill or becoming more disciplined or moving past some type of sin. We don't want to wait a bunch of years or weeks or even days, we want to see results right now. But instead of getting frustrated with where we think we should be, and getting upset about the progress that we haven't made, we need to focus on moving forward, taking it one step at a time. Jesus said in Matthew chapter six and verse 34, that we need to not worry about tomorrow. He said each day has its own trouble. There's enough trouble in today, and not worry about tomorrow, and so do what you can today. Nehemiah says rise up and build today. Don't allow the size and the scope of the project to bog you down keep working towards progress one step at a time, one rock at a time. And the Lord will bless our efforts. And finally, notice the last obstacle faced by Nehemiah verse 19. It says but when sandbelt the horn night Tobiah the Ammonite official and Jessem the Arab heard of it, they laughed at us and despised us. And they said what is this thing that you are doing? Will you rebel against the king? So I answered them and said to them, the God of heaven, himself will prosperous. Therefore we His servants will arise and build, but you have no heritage or rights or memorial in Jerusalem. Now the enemies, the people, those who are living around Jerusalem begin to put pressure on Nehemiah, they are mocking they're laughing and ridiculing him. There is this outside pressure. These people are trying to discourage them from the work that they're doing. And it isn't as true whenever God's people have success or a person begins to make progress. There's always going to be those who are standing in the way trying to say things to bring us back to tear us down to try to discourage us. In John chapter 15 And verse 18. It says, Jesus says that if the world The world will hate you remember that it hated me first, that Jesus faced opposition and persecution and so we will face the same whether it's jealousy or someone desires more power, or they're just trying to make themselves feel good. There will always be those who oppose God's people. But look at verse 20. In verse 20, Nehemiah says the God of heaven himself will prosper us. Therefore we His servants will arise and build. Nehemiah doesn't try to answer their charges. He doesn't try to speak out against them. He just has confidence in God. He is confidence in God's blessing that the Lord will continue to help them?

Conrad Harkrider  30:06
And so we have to have that same type of mentality and approach when people try to stand against us. They ask, Why do you talk this way? Why do you live this way? Why do you act and do these things, we can have confidence that we are following God's plan, that God will continue to bless and provide for us that we are His people. We are a special chosen people who are called to live differently from this world. And ultimately, we will receive all of the blessings in Christ for following and obeying His Word. In Joshua chapter one and verse nine. It says, Have I not commanded you, be strong and courageous, do not be frightened, and do not be dismayed. For the Lord your God is with you, wherever you go. Nehemiah had that courage. He had that, that focus and that faith and he passed that on to other people. He helped others to be able to rise up in courage to be able to build for the Lord. We're gonna close tonight with an invitation song. It's an opportunity for any who are here who may or may need to respond to the call the gospel. If you need to submit your life to Christ by putting on him in baptism, or if there's something that we can do to help you in your walk. Please come down to the front as we stand and seen
