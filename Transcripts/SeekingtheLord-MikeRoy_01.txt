It's always such a blessing to have an opportunity to worship God as we're doing this morning, we know we're living in different times and we're accustomed to, but God is still God. And we still have an opportunity to come to him today to glorify Him, as we've been doing this morning through the prayers and songs and preaching and no teaching of God's Word and remembering Jesus, the Lord suffers, so we keep our eyes on Him, we look to Him, from day to day, as we journey through this life. You know, there's a lot of maybe some well known commands or instructions in Scripture that are so almost so well known that we kind of take them for granted. And I think such as the case with the idea of seeking the Lord. And I want us to think about that this morning, is we are going to take a look at this passage, at least one verse from which Evan had read this morning, the idea of seeking the Lord seeking his strength and seeking His presence. And again, these statements like this are so, so common, and are so well known that we oftentimes don't stop to think about what what it really means or what's involved with that. And so I wanted this morning, instead of taking a look at an entire chapter, the Bible or something, just take at one, one single verse, and kind of mind the scriptures and dissect that to see what it means and how we can apply that to our lives. And so I want to look at that this morning with you the passage, and I'm just going to focus here in on verse 11. As Evan pointed out, this was a Psalm of Thanksgiving, I think, from David. And the Psalm was filled with gratitude and appreciation for what God has done for us. We sink to him, we thank him, verse 10, we glory in His holy name, where we boast, we boast in God's name. We remember all the ways down, but look at verse 11. And in the midst of this song, this, this, not necessarily a song, but it would it would be a like a song that David had composed is this statement, to seek the Lord and His strength, seek His presence continually. And so what I want to do this morning in our

Mike Roy  02:24
this time of worship, and with my message is to do just that. What does it mean to seek the Lord? What does it mean to seek his strength and seek His presence continually as reading over the last week or so some online messages in this scripture came up, and it kind of made me think about how we can apply that to our lives. And so we want to be we're going to focus on first Chronicles, Chapter 16, verse 11, give very, very well known instructions, we look at these statements, when it said, tells us to seek the Lord, to seek his strength and seek His presence continually. And we just oftentimes, just almost dismiss that and forget, forget to think about what's involved in that, that process. So let me suggest to you as we focusing on this, this particular verse first Chronicles, Chapter 16, and verse 11, I see three actions, very basic actions, where to seek the Lord, where to seek his strength, and where to seek His presence continually, an ongoing basis, we, we seek God's presence, on a regular basis. So when you think about this brief verse of scripture, again, this, the basic charge here, is to seek God. So the question I'm asking is, we make some practical applications for our lives from this verse. What does it mean, to seek God I know you know that and and, but oftentimes, we we really fail to delve into that. So we're asking the question, what does it mean to seek God one of the ways I think that we can illustrate that is from the well known children's game of hide and seek, I played that a few times in my life, probably many of you did, as well. So when you're playing hide and seek or kids are playing hide and seek, I think it's called that hide and go seek or however you call it, or down, down south, but so when the friend goes to hide, and it's your turn to do the seeking, do you just sit down and don't do anything at all? And you just wait for that person to come out from behind the bush? No. As kids, we would just start looking everywhere, looking under every stone behind a retreat every valley behind every bush in the barn behind the barn. We just actively and intentionally began looking passionately for our friend who is hiding and can even raise the question Is God hiding we say seek seek God look for him. Noah Teddy's hiding, but he's sort of the hiding behind all of His creation, we see evidence of his power through the sunshine, the rain, all that type of thing. And so the when the salt when when David tells us to seek God, then that means we this is something this is an active, intentional activity that we we pursue him we look for him to sing the song looking to the we look for him, how do we find God, we can't, we can't see him physically. But we see His word and we see evidence of his power in creation. And so I think sometimes that that little children's game that we've all played in our lives, illustrates what to look for, to be looking for something or someone. And the same thing is true when it comes to finding God that we search for him. We seek him diligently, passionately, intentionally. And I want to say this, even in the midst of uncertainty in trials that we're dealing with, we can we can cert we can seek God, who can give us the peace that surpasses all understanding. So here's three, three points I want to take from this particular phrase. And again, something I discovered over the last week or two said three ways to seek God's presence to seek His strength to seek him today. Number one, we'll talk about this in just a moment. But we spent need to spend quality time with him in nature or creation. We spend intentional time with Him in prayer. And we spend time reflecting on and meditating on a verse of Scripture. So these are some very practical things that you can do to seek God, I understand we've obeyed the gospel of Christ, we're in a covenant relationship with him. But we still have struggles, I have struggles, we still have difficulties that we all face. And one of the things, one of the great

Mike Roy  06:58
avenues of resource that's available to us is the fact that we can seek God in the midst of difficulty in the midst of uncertainty in the midst of loneliness, in the midst of fear in the midst of trial. And, and this is instruction that would be practical for God's people, they would be eventually going into captivity, the Babylonian captivity. And so there's again three ways. I think that we can seek God's presence today. And as you go into the week, tomorrow, do the same thing. We can we can do these things, I think with a degree of a purpose, without an intentional focus. So the first thing I want us to focus on this morning is that we we seek God we can seek God by spending quality time with him in nature and in His creation. And so it's just a reminder that God makes His power known to us through His creation. And in so doing, we can be refreshed by that. Think of the Psalm And Psalm tip to 19 verses one through four. There's so much more in the Psalms that we can read. But the psalmist says that the heavens declare the glory of God in the sky above proclaims His handiwork, day to day pours out speech and night tonight reveals knowledge, there is no speech nor other words, whose voice is not heard. Their voice goes out through all the earth, in their words, the end of the world. And he talks about setting the sun. He set the sun, set a tent for the sun, and it comes out like a bridegroom from his it's chamber. But the point here is that the heavens declare the glory of God. Every time you look at the sun, the moon, the stars, the mountains, the rivers, you see God's handiwork. So I'm suggesting, first of all, one way that we can seek God today is to surround ourselves in his in his creation. And because we're reminded of his power, and his wisdom and his beauty, that is evidence, every time we we look around back one reason that we have, I think I speak for a lot of us that have been doing the yard worship services in our backyard and other people's yards. One reason I enjoy it so much, is because we're in God's creation, and we're singing outside, we're preaching, we're praying, we're taking the Lord's supper together, but we're surrounded by the trees and hear the birds and see the sun and feel the wind and all of that stuff reminds us of God's power. And so when we when we look at creation, we see the creator and we see His handiwork. And this time of the year, I should say that we've been been enjoying the yard assemblies. But on a day like today when the rain comes down, it's not so much fun to be sitting in the rain outside. But the rain does remind us that God sends the rain from heaven, and he nourishes the field. In the end, he gives us sustenance from that. And so we, even though rain may throw a damper in some of our plants, we appreciate that as a blessing from God, because it's one of the ways that he meets all of our needs. Also, this time of the year, when the leaves start to change colors, it's just a very encouraging time to notice that the changing of the leaves as they turn from, excuse me, green to brown or red and different colors. Again, being out in God's creation, I saw some pictures at norm posted on Facebook the other day, in Metcalf bottoms and the Smoky Mountains. And you can see all the different colors of the of the leaves on the tree. And so, again, when we get out, when we get out into the creation, we come to see the evidence of God's power through His creation. And so again, we ask ourselves, why do we go to the mountains? Why do we go to the ocean? Why do we go out west and see the vast valleys and the prayers and all that, because we're refreshed with God's presence, we feel his presence, when we get out into his creation. It's interesting to notice that Jesus, oftentimes, when he needed to be refreshed in his strength and built up in this space, he would go out into creation, he would go out his favorite place, I believe was the garden get 70 say this the

Mike Roy  11:45
right the garden, which was a in all of stand up all these trees, and he was surrounded by God's presence there. And the text and script would say that he went off to a mountain to pray that he went into the wilderness that he went to a deserted place. And so we see Jesus, taking advantage of the opportunity to get out into God's creation. Because in that context, he would actually be seeking God. So we seek God, one way that we do that is by seeking Him and going out into his creation. And what I want to suggest to us is that when we surround ourselves with God's creation, we surround ourselves with God. So this great power and value and benefit, and getting out into God's creation again with us, the oceans, the deserts, the rivers, to mountains, the valleys, whatever it might be, they all testify of God's power in his care for His creation. So we're talking about this song that tells us to seek God and His strength and seek His presence continually. Well, one of the ways that we seek can seek God is when we get out it to his creation, and we're surrounded by His Majesty and His power and His wisdom, and the kindness, the sunshine and the rain are all manifestations of His kindness. And so, one of the ways that we quote, seek God is by spending time in his creation. Secondly, I want to suggest to us, to each of us that we can see we seek God by spending intentional time in prayer. Again, we have struggles and trials that we face. And we all certainly do at different times. I like the song that we sometimes sing. What a friend we have in Jesus. It says what a friend we have in Jesus all our sins and grieves to bear what a privilege to carry everything to God in prayer. All what peace we often forfeit. Oh, what needless pain we bear all because we do not carry everything to God in prayer. It continues, have we trials and temptations? Is there trouble anywhere? We should never be discouraged. Take it to the Lord and pray. And then the last verse says, can we find a friend so faithful? Who will all our sorrows, very have sorrows in your life? We all do. Probably it times. Jesus knows our every weakness. Take it to the Lord in prayer. And so, again, the second way that we can seek God and seek His strength is to spend time with intentional prayer. What I mean by that is not just being vague or general in our prayer, but being specific and intentional in our prayers. When Paul wrote to the Christians at Philippi. Again, I made reference to this and Gil's class this morning, Paul is in Roman imprisonment for the cause of Christ. But he said he was set there for the defense of the gospel His heart is full of joy because he's gonna he wants to save souls and build up the body of Christ. And it's what he says over here Rejoice in the Lord always. And we can't repass that in just dismiss the fact that Paul's in prison, you get trials, you get difficulties it temptations adversity, loneliness, whatever it may be. We all have those things at different times in our lives. But Paul is in prison in his message is Rejoice in the Lord always. Again, I will say rejoice. Let your reasonableness be known to everyone, the Lord is at hand. Do not be anxious about anything. Again, instruction, do not be anxious about anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God. So when you're hurting, when there's difficulties, when there's trials and burdens that we all face, in our lives, even as Christians, let your requests be made known to God, tell God how you're hurting. Tell God where you're hurting. Tell God of the difficulties that you're facing, or the financial adversities or hardships wherever you might be dealing with. Paul said, let your requests be made known to God, and the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus. So when you look at this instruction of Philippians, chapter four, Paul reminds us that God wants us to share our difficulties in our trials. And so the point I'm saying is that we seek God and we seek his strength.

Mike Roy  16:42
And we seek His presence on a continual basis, when we are when we're constant in prayer, when we pray without ceasing. And when we're specific in our prayers, and I think that's, it's, it's helpful to do that. And it's helpful for all of us to do that. I think about Matthew chapter 26. I'm just gonna look there briefly, for one a minute. Jesus was here in the garden, and guess how many facing the cross the great difficulties that he would be undergoing, you know, basically taking upon him the sins of all the world. Think about the loneliness, the isolation, God basically having to turn his back on his son. And the text says that Jesus came with them to a place called Get seminary, and said to his disciples sit here while I go there and pray. And he took with him Peter, and the two sons of Zebedee and began to be grieved and distressed. Again, one thing's looking at Scripture, we very often read past Jesus own suffering, we think, Well, he was the son of God. And and he didn't face trials and temptations. That's not true. He did. He faced his grief and sorrows in the same way that you and I do on the basis of faith and determination to overcome them. So here's Jesus, knowing that the time is imminent, the time is coming, where he's going to be put to death and suffer for the sins of all the word, the world. He's grieved. And he's distressed. In verse 38, he said to his disciples, Peter, James, and John, My soul is deeply grieved, to the point of death, remained remain here and keep watch with me. And one of the ways that Jesus received the strength was being around God's people. And in this case, again, it shows us the these, the weakness of these men not being able to stay awake with him. But so here Jesus is facing an enormous crisis and trial. And he's facing tremendous grief in a lot of stress. And what does he do? Because he gathers his best friends around him. And then he goes to his father in prayer, and praise specifically, said, Father in verse 39, he fell on his face, sim Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from me yet not as I will, but as you will. So Jesus asked his father, to let the cup of suffering and the and really being the the sin burden for all the world, let that pass, he put that specifically before the Father, with the understanding that if this is not your will, may, may I accept your will. And then verse 40, came to his disciples, he found them sleeping, and he said, so you could not want to keep watch with me for one hour, keep watching and praying that you may not enter into temptation. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak. And then in verse 42, he went away again a second time, and prayed, saying, My Father, if this cannot pass away, unless I drink it, your will be done. So again, Jesus specifically praying for the suffering that he's about to undertake. He comes back, you still find some sleeping. In verse 4044. He left them again and went away in prayer. A third time. So the point I make over here is that we were talking about this first that tells us to seek the Lord and His strength and seek His presence continually. The second way that we seek the Lord is by coming to Him in prayer. And we we recognize the value of that. And we come together publicly as we do and have word of prayers we've done this morning several times. But the other element of prayer is private prayer. Well, how are you doing in the a personal private prayer with God, to get on your knees when you pray to Him, define a solitary place to pray, isolated, maybe a separate bedroom, maybe out behind your workshop, maybe down by the river, maybe up on a mountain.

Mike Roy  20:47
Again, those are opportunities that when we get away to the mountains, I was trying to find a place where I can go by myself. And and so prayer is one of the ways that we seek God. And again, I'll tell you, in my own experience of my living on this earth, and serving God, with my family, and here with this church, and in seeking to do His will, prayer makes a difference. Prayer makes a difference. When I spent intentional time in prayer with God, sometimes coupled with fasting, God gives us God gives me strength for the challenges that I face. So again, when we think about this verse, when it tells us, and David is really kind of giving this a charge to seek God, while we've got creation, we seek Him, but seek we seek Him, when we spend time in prayer, praying specifically for what's going on in our life, God not already knows, don't have to hide that from him. He knows the struggles, that trials. And we all wrestle with things in our minds that are not healthy and helpful. So so the second way that we seek God is seek his strength, is by spending time in intentional prayer. And as you know, as well as I do, prayer can be a very exhausting activity. And so that you know, to be intentional pray, that means be gonna be alert and awake, and be focused on what we're doing. We always, always pray for God's will to be done, not our own. But this is one of the tools that God has given us. And when we spend time in prayer, then it's a, it's one of the ways that we seek God. Then the third point I want to make from this text this morning, when David tells us to seek God and seek his strength and seek His presence continually. One of the ways that we seek God is by reflecting and meditating on His Word. And the more I reflect on the Word of God, and meditate on what God has said to me, it changes me empowers me for the struggles of trials and challenges that I face in my life, and I know that you do as well. And so when you look at when you look at Scripture, we are reminded of the power of meditation, and Psalm chapter one one of the most well known Psalms. Again, David is giving instructions for the God demands to bless this man who walks not in the counsel of the wicked, nor stands in the way of the sinners, nor sits in the seat of scoffers, but his delight is in the law of the Lord. And on his law, he meditates day and night. Again, Bible meditation is, is a challenging activity because we have so many distractions, so many temptations coming our way. And so much activity going on in life that we don't oftentimes sit down and think about what God has revealed to us. So the godly man doesn't listen to the the wicked person, the scoffers he delights in the law of God. And the question we have to ask ourselves is, do I delight in the Word of God? David de lighted in God's word, as one who is finding great treasure or honey, something so sweet. And you see that laced throughout the Psalms, but when we meditate on on God's word, and on his law, and we do that on a regular basis, that's one of the ways that we seek Him. And that's one of the ways we gain our strength from him by reflecting and meditating on in fact, what I'm even suggesting this morning, so reflect on the Word of God, but even reflect on the on a single verse of scripture. That's kind of what I was doing this morning. With, we're looking at a well known statement that's not difficult to understand. When David says to seek God and seek his strength and seek His presence continually to stop for a minute and just digest. What does that mean? And so again, we've been talking about that this morning. But one of the ways that we seek God and we seek His strength

Mike Roy  25:16
is when we stop and look at a verse of Scripture during a busy day. So I'm going to read this thing and think about what that means to me. One verse that comes to mind I want to just share quickly and in Second Peter chapter one, we have been studying coursing gills clasp in a Second Peter, chapter one Peters is a bondservant, an apostle of Christ Jesus to those who have received the faith of the same kind as ours by the righteousness of our God, of our God and Savior, Jesus Christ. Grace and peace be multiplied to the knowledge of God in Jesus our Lord, seeing that his divine power has granted to us everything pertaining to life and godliness, through the true knowledge of him who called us by His own glory next, now think about that for just a second this what meditation is, what is he saying over here, that according to God's divine power, think about this, he has granted to us everything pertaining to life and godliness. I've got everything I need to get to heaven. I've got everything I need to leave, leave my wife and my family and holiness and faithfulness to God, I have everything I need, God has given us everything we need to serve Him, to make ends meet with our family, but especially to arrive safely in heaven, that is the goal. So Peters, reminding them a bat that God has divine power has granted to us everything pertaining to life and godliness, through the true knowledge of him who called us by His own glory and excellence. So God called us to him to be His servants, by his own glorious power and his own virtue. And surely, that should encourage us to persevere in our faith is in verse four, by the for by these, he is granted to us as precious and magnificent promises, so that by them, you may become partakers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in a world by less so again, think about this, when you look at Think about the promises that God has given to us to always be with us, to deliver us from our trials and our temptations. And in so you understand then, that He has given us such powerful promises, that has allows us to become partakers of the divine nature. So again, when we look at a scripture or even a couple Scripture, we need to think about what those verses are saying to us. And and ultimately, in that process of meditating on Scripture, we are seeking God, we're seeking his strength. Do you need more strength for your life? We all do. You need more perseverance, we all do. But when we meditate, and not just read scripture, so many times in our Bible reading program, because now I listen to mine, through my phone and my hearing aids, and it's convenient. But it's one thing to just read a verse of Scripture, it's another thing to think about it. Wow. God called me to himself by his own virtue, and power and love is given me every promise I need to partake of the divine nature. These these promises should stop us in our boots and make us think about the depth of God's love for us. So again, it's a reminder that one of the things that is so helpful for each of us is to stop and to meditate on the Word of God, it makes an enormous difference in our lives when we spend private time, quality time, looking at God's word, thinking about these promises. It prepares us for the battle. It helps us to sanctify Christ as Lord so that we are merely ready to give a defense for our faith is killed, again talked about this morning. But the preparation has to be made before you go into battle. And if we're going to be ready for the spiritual battle, which is out there, we face it every day, then that means we need to be reflecting on and considering and meditating on God's word. So this morning, I wanted to take a simple verse of scripture and just talk about that. So what we discussed this morning that we seek God we seek his train, and we seek His presence by spending time in his creation, by spending intentional time in prayer. And by reflecting on and meditating on a simple or a single verses scripture. So these are not like Shocking Truths that we're not aware of we all know about these things. But so often times it's a matter of practicing the very things that that we read in Scripture and know about. So

Mike Roy  30:13
the charge is to seek God, seek his strength, and seek His presence continually. And this is, I think, one of the ways that we did this, there may be others. So I hope that lesson will be helpful for each of us for each of you, as we all face challenges in our lives. And as we extend the invitation song this morning, the message that Jesus gives to first century people who met many of them Gentiles, many of them Jews, who are anxious about their lives, what are we going to eat? What are we going to drink, and all this type of thing and and Jesus had that, that the Gentiles seek all these things, but he said, Seek first. So there's the the the charge against about seeking, seeking, God of all the things that we seek in life, that silver and gold and popularity and acceptance and whatever it may be, the most important thing for us to do is to seek God's kingdom and his righteousness and to seek it first. Not second, not when you get a job, not when you get married, not when you have children, not going to get retirement, you see God first. And so the principle of seeking is taught clearly throughout Scripture. So hopefully the lesson will be encouragement to each of us. If there are any here that need prayer and for strength, for the challenges that you face. We can you can come while we stand and sing this invitation song
