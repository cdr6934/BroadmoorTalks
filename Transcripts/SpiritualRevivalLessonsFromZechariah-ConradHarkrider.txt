So good to see each of you here this morning. Thank you today for the songs that he led for us. And for brother tan for the the words about the memorial. So appreciate that and thankful to each one of you for for being here this morning. If you want to open up your Bibles to the book of Zachariah. We're going to be studying from there in just a few moments. Zachariah chapter one.

Conrad Harkrider  00:42
In the New Testament, we read about a number of men and women that had a tremendous impact on the people around them. And because of their actions of faith, and their devotion and service to God, they often developed a reputation and sometimes they were even given a new name. And that was the case with a man named Joseph or Josias, he owned a piece of property, and he took it and went and sold the land, and brought the proceeds from the sale to the apostles and laid it at their feet. And because of his concern for others, his desire to help those around him, he was given the name Barnabas, which means son of encouragement. throughout the New Testament, we read about multiple instances where Barnabas was working to build up to help other brothers and sisters in Christ. He was a person who built bridges between people. If there were two parties that were in conflict or at odds, he sought to bring them together. And he was always finding ways to stir up his his brothers to try to motivate them in their service to God. He was an encourager. Well, this morning, we're going to look at some of the writings from another encourager from the Old Testament, from the Book of Zachariah. And he was sent to God's people during one of the darkest times in their history. And he his goal was to start a restoration to revive God's people. And the way that he would do that was by encouraging them by trying to, to stir them up to motivate them in their service to the Lord. So let's think about this idea of spiritual revival. And some of the lessons that we can take from this great book. We've been studying this on Wednesday nights. And so what I'd like to do is just do kind of an overview of a few of the great lessons from the Book of Zachariah. When the people returned from Babylonian captivity. They came back to a land that was, it was in ruins. The walls had been torn down the palace, the king's house had been burned, the city itself was decimated. And their enemies and the people around them were not making it easy on them to come back and to get things restored. They were harassing them, they were taunting them. And so it's at this time that God sends two of his profits to the people to try to help them in this effort. Haggai and Zachariah Haggai was a prophet who was more direct in his dealings with the people. His prophecies were short and straight to the point. You can see that from the book of Haggai, there's only two chapters. In chapter one and verse eight. He delivers the Lord's instructions and he says, go into the mountains and bring down timbers and build my house. He didn't mince words, there wasn't a lot of ambiguity in what he was saying. He told them exactly what they needed to do. Haggai came to the people with a strong and a stern message. But Zachariah was more subtle. They both work together they had generally the same message they were trying to get the people to Rebuild God's house, but Zacharias spoke in a more roundabout way. He used visions and dreams to try to convey this message. To the people. His words were filled with optimism and hope. Yes, he tried to stir the people. But he also surrounded that message with themes of the future, about God's promises about how God was going to help his people. And he will ultimately restore them. And so we see that Zachariah was kind of like a Barnabas, he was an encourager, trying to help and lift God's people up to remind them of the great blessings that God had in store for them. By the way, both of these approaches,

Conrad Harkrider  05:42
the stern and direct that came from Haggai. And the more encouraging supporting that came from Zachariah, both of those are needed. And maybe that's why God chose these two men to work together and sent them to his people at this critical time. Well, let's start in Zechariah, chapter one and verse one. Zachariah one and verse one. It says, In the eighth month, in the second year of Darius, the word of the Lord came to the Prophet Zechariah, the son of bear Kaia, son of Iddo, saying, The Lord was very angry with your fathers, therefore say to them, thus declares the LORD of hosts returned to me, says the Lord of hosts, and I will return to us as the Lord of hosts. Do not be like your father's, to whom the former prophets cried out, Thus says the Lord of hosts, returned from your evil ways and from your evil deeds, but they did not hear or pay attention to me, declares the Lord. The first lesson that we can see from the Book of Zachariah, we think about this spiritual revival is the the need to return to the Lord returned to the Lord. The book starts with the Lord reminding them about what has happened to their people, their ancestors, their fathers, in times past. He says in verse two, that the Lord was very angry with their fathers, that those who rebelled against the Lord, they had turned after these false gods, they had followed their own ways, their own paths. And so God had brought this great calamity upon them, they were carried off into captivity. But notice what he says in verse four, about those who came before them. He says, they did not hear or pay attention. They didn't listen to the warning to the cry of God's prophets. To ignore someone's warning, or caution is is not just frustrating for the person who is trying to help. But it also will be it also can be very, very dangerous. Last month, we had the presidential debate here in Nashville. And as a part of that they set up a no fly zone around the city of Nashville for security purposes, you weren't allowed to fly aircraft in and out of the city freely. Well, there was a private jet, a private plane that entered into that restricted airspace, the afternoon of the debate. And they were calling and trying to establish a radio communication with the pilot, but there was no answer. And so finally, they scrambled an F 16 fighter jet south of Nashville. And the jet got up there and was flying next to this plane, and still, it was heading towards the city. And so eventually, they fired off warning flares in front of the plane. And thankfully, were able to establish a communication with the pilot and they read read averted their course. But that's what was happening with God's people. They were on this course of destruction. They were headed down this path and there was nothing that could deter them from where they were headed. God sent His prophets, God sent foreign armies to try to get them to turn back to him. He said natural disasters all of these things that happen but yet they wouldn't listen to His word. Listening to the Word of God is such a important aspect of returning, that we would open our our ears that we'd be receptive to the Lord. And this is a theme that comes up in the book of Proverbs in Proverbs chapter 12 And verse 15. It says the way of a fool is right in his own eyes, but a wise man listens. Advice. In Proverbs chapter 13, in verse one, A wise son hears his father's instruction. But a scoffer does not listen to rebuke. And in Proverbs 15 And verse 31, the ear that listens to life giving reproof will dwell among the why's. That idea of

Conrad Harkrider  10:24
being open, being receptive, listening to the advice, and the counsel of others is so important. You know, it's a danger for us, especially when we're younger, when we think we've got it all figured out. We know the best course we know we can make our own decisions. But God's designed is for the younger to listen to the Council of those who are older, for children to obey their parents, for young people to respect the wisdom of those who have more experience who have gone through some of these things. And the point is, look, when we're young, we don't have to experience everything to know that it's not a good idea. We don't have to make a mess of our lives to then realize that God's ways are best. God wants us to avoid some of those pitfalls from the start. Things that can be so damaging to our lives throughout our lives, things like drugs, and alcohol and pornography, those are not just minor things they can stick with us for for decades to come. And so we need to listen and follow the instructions, and the guidance of those who are older than us. Returning to the Lord means that we need to hear that we open our ears, but it also means that we need to honor and obey God's word. Look at chapter one and verse six. It says, but my words and my statutes which I commanded my servants the prophets, did they not overtake your father's? So they repented and said, As the Lord of hosts purpose to deal with us for our ways and deeds, so he has dealt with us. Returning to God is not some abstract concept. It involves listening, but also obeying and following God's commands and his precepts. To return to God is not just to think a thought or to say a prayer. In our heads, we have to follow it to live by His instructions. And that's what he says here. He's calling his people to return to him, but in that they are to return to following and keeping his word. And notice that in verse six, it says that they repented, they turn back. This is the generation that was in captivity, they realize the the sin that they had committed, and they eventually turned back to the Lord. Well, this is a message that is relevant to every generation returning to the Lord. It's what Peter preached on the day of Pentecost and Acts chapter two and verse 40. It says that he told the people with many words to be saved from this perverse generation from this crooked generation. And so the appeal is made to us today. We need to return back to the Lord. Well, secondly, if there's going to be a spiritual restoration or revival, we need to rebuild God's house. Look at Zachariah chapter four and verse eight. In Zachariah four, there's this incredible vision of a Golden Lampstand. And one of the dreams that he sees in the middle of the night in a verse eight, God and Zachariah is, is going to explain the the meaning of this vision and he says the word of the Lord Zechariah four, eight, the word of the Lord came to me saying, the hands of Zerubbabel have laid the foundation of this house, his hands shall also completed then you will know that the Lord of hosts has sent me to you, for whoever has despised the day of small things shower don't rejoice, and shall see the plumb line in the hand observable. These are the seven eyes of the Lord which range through the whole earth. So when God's people came back into the land, under the direction of Zerubbabel, they had some early success. They lay the foundation of the temple but then the project got stalled. There was resistance from the people around But there was also competing priorities. We know from the book of Haggai, that they were preoccupied with building their own homes with getting their own houses set up.

Conrad Harkrider  15:17
And so they made some early project progress on the project, but then it gets it gets stalled. And so Zachariah for God is going to come and give some encouragement to Zachariah and the people and try to get them moving again on this effort. And notice the confidence and the certainty that he speaks with in verse eight. He says, he says in verse eight, his hands shall also completed. The Lord says, this is going to get done, this will come to pass, even if it seems like an incredibly difficult challenge for the people that there's lots of obstacles that they're facing, this will ultimately be successful. And in verse 10, he says that those who say, this is a small thing, those who saw their, their progress, their work as insignificant or is not very important. They would ultimately rejoice, they would see the success and the and the progress of zakra Zerubbabel, and the people and they would rejoice. But notice how they were going to be successful. From verse six of chapter four. It says, Then he said to me, this is the word of the Lord to servable. Not by might, nor by power, but by My Spirit, says the Lord of hosts. So it wasn't going to happen because they were so strong because they had so many resources at their disposal, because storable was such a great and wise leader, but rather they would be successful because of the Lord's spirit, because God was blessing them. And they would have to rely on the Lord and His strength. The walls of the city of Jerusalem, were rebuilt in the year 444 BC. And Trevor Brandt reminded me of a way to remember that there's four walls in a room. So 444, that's the year that the walls were rebuilt. The temple undesirables direction was rebuilt in the year 515 BC. So about seven years prior to the walls being rebuilt, the temple was completed. Well, what does all that mean? Well, the temple of the Lord, the house of God, was to be finished first. God wanted them to rebuild his house before they set up the walls before they got their, their security in place before they established the protections around the city. He wanted them to rebuild his house. The house of God, the temple of the Lord, in a spiritual sense is is still being rebuilt. It's being built today. And it's the most important work that is before us to expand God's kingdom for God's people to be built up, to grow in faith to grow in knowledge to mature to become more like Christ. All of that is entailed when we think about building up God's house or building his kingdom. When we think about what was going on in, in this time, we have to ask, Has that work taken a backseat? Has it fallen down the list of priorities? Has it been shifted to the side because of other pressing or urgent matters. The other night the kids were wanting to see a video on my phone that I had taken of them, they just wanted to rewatch it. And so I said, Well, let's clean up the toys first. So we cleaned up all the toys. I said, Let's go upstairs and we went upstairs. I said, let's get in our pajamas. And they got dressed. I said, Well, let's brush our teeth. And they brush their teeth. And I said, Well, let's read a book. And finally one of them looked up and she said Daddy, are we ever going to watch that video? And to be honest, I had kind of forgotten about it. It had kind of gone gone out of my mind. Kids don't easily forget things when you say you can do this in just a minute.

Conrad Harkrider  19:56
But that's how isn't that what often happens with the Lord's work with things that are important, we put them off to the side. There's something that's more pressing, it could be the job, the house, family, friends, hobbies, recreation, those things aren't necessarily bad. But when they take place, when we when they take place of our service to God, or we put them ahead of our service to God, we are neglecting building the Lord's house. As one writer said, Things which matter most must never be at the mercy of things which matter least, we've got to keep God in that top spot. No matter what's going on in our life. No matter how busy we are, no matter what type of environment we find ourselves in. He has to have our greatest our heart's desire, the song that some of the songs that we sing this morning about seeking God first, Matthew, chapter six, in verse 33, Seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness and all these things will be added to you building God's house is our primary focus. Everything else is just details. Also, in this spiritual revival, the Lord will restore what's been lost. God is ultimately going to restore what's been lost. And we see that from the Book of Zachariah. These people were coming back from captivity, they had been taken away, they felt like they were abandoned. They, in many ways had nothing to hope for all of their, their lives have been destroyed. But yet, Zachariah promises that God is going to restore, he's going to bless them, he's going to help them to build and put things back together. Look at chapter nine, and verse 11.

Conrad Harkrider  22:17
Zachariah nine in verse 11. It says, As for you also, because of the blood of my covenant with you, I will set your prisoners free from the waterless pit for return to your stronghold of prisoners of hope. Today I declare that I will restore to you double. For I have been Judah as my bow and made Aetherium its arrow, I will stir up your son's Oh Zion against your son's Oh grease and wield you like a warrior's sword. So as we said at the beginning, Zachariah brings this message of encouragement, this message of hope to the people. And hearing makes reference in verse 11, to the blood of the covenant, the blood of the covenant, that term is only found two times in the Old Testament, in Zechariah, chapter nine, and the other is from Exodus chapter 24. And verse eight, when Moses took blood and sprinkled it upon the people when they established that covenant with the Lord. And so now, God is reminding them that he has not forgotten that promise. That covenant that he entered into with his fleet with his people, he was going to be faithful to that. He was going to restore what had been lost, and renew the covenant with His people to remember the promises that He had made to them. And look what he says he offers to set their prisoners free to set them free. He also talks about the waterless pit, the waterless pit that reminds us of Joseph, who was also thrown into a waterless pit by his brothers, and eventually he was sold off into Egyptian slavery, but God was still with him every step of the way. And notice what God is going to do for them here in verse 12. He says that he will bring them back to their stronghold to their fortress so that they can be protected. And that he says he refers to them as now prisoners of hope. They are going to be blessed with this hope. He says he's going to restore a double portion to them. So there's this amazing transformation that's happening here. The people are going from being prisoners of despair prisoners of these foreign nations to now God is To make them prisoners of hope. And that's what the Lord is able to do. He's able to take a life that has seemingly no hope, no direction or purpose, and he can change it into something that is a great blessing. In Romans chapter six and verse 13, Paul talks about not presenting your members to sin as instruments for unrighteousness, but present yourselves to God as those who have been brought from death to life, and your members to God as instruments for righteousness. So there's this transformation going from being a slave to sin, and then being a slave to righteousness, a slave to God. And that's what we see in Zachariah. He's taking these people who were kind of chewed up and they were taken off carried away into captivity. Now he brings them back, he says, I'm going to make you a people, I'm going to restore you to your former blessing and former greatness. And when God restores his people, he gives them this double portion more than they had before. And that's the same for us today, when God forgives, when God blesses he doesn't hold it against us. He doesn't keep remembering or bringing it up. It is as if it never happened in his eyes. In the parable of the prodigal, when Jesus tells about the son who returns to his father's house, that description of the reunion is amazing because they throw this incredibly lavish party. The father doesn't make him sleep out back, he doesn't cause him to be like a slave in the house having to do all the lowest work, but instead he elevates him to the position of a son. He blesses him, and gives him all the rights and benefits of being one of his children.

Conrad Harkrider  27:06
And so it is when we are forgiven of our sins. When we come to the Lord. When we become one of his children. We are completely restored, God restores, what has been lost. And finally, with this spiritual revival, in order for this to be completed, the Lord will reclaim the nation's God is going to reclaim the nation's look at Zechariah chapter eight, and verse 21. Zechariah eight in verse 21, it says, The inhabitants of one city shall go to another saying, Let us go at once to entreat the favor of the Lord, and to seek the Lord of hosts, I myself am going, many peoples among many peoples and strong nations shall come to seek the Lord of hosts in Jerusalem, and to entreat the favor of the Lord. So he talks about a time when there will be other people's other nations that are going to come and join together with God's people. The promises that were made to Abraham were to bless him and his family and his offspring to give them a land of promise. But God's ultimate purpose and blessing Abraham and Isaac and Jacob and his sons was not just for the benefit of a small, local group of people, but rather that through those promises, all people of the of the world would receive a blessing and we see that fulfilled in Jesus Christ. But Zachariah shows us, he alludes to this idea that God wants to help. God wants to bless all nations, that he cares about all people, regardless of their race, their origin, their skin color, he wants to bring them into his family. First, 22 says that many peoples and nations will come to seek the Lord. Look at the imagery of verse 23. He says that these outsiders are going to grab on to the robe of God's people, and say, let us come with you. Let us go with you. We want to be in the presence of the Lord. And we have to ask ourselves, do we have that same perspective on God's kingdom, that God desires for all people to be saved? Not just people that are in our social circles or that look exactly like us or that think and live in similar ways that we do but regardless of what language they speak, or what where they came from or how much money they have or where they live, God desires for all people to be saved. And secondly, these people are grabbing on to the robe saying that we want to come with you. If I'm about to walk out of the house that I tell my kids that I'm going to get ice cream, who wants to come? They are in that car so fast. It's unbelievable that they how quickly they can get ready. But if I'm walking out the door, and I say, I am going to rake the leaves, who wants to come with me? Well, now all of a sudden, there's no volunteers. And the point is, sometimes we treat our service to God, going to church, spending time in God's word, being with other Christians. Sometimes we think about that more like a like a chore like raking the leaves, rather than a treat, a delight. It's like eating ice cream. It's like filling ourselves with something that is sweet and desirable. And what Pete When people look at us, they should see a sense of joy, of zeal of excitement that we desire and long to be with God to be with his people. And that is contagious. They see that and they they would acknowledge our example and there would be a desire to have what we have to be in God's presence. Jesus said in Matthew chapter five and verse 13, that you're the salt of the earth. But if the salt has lost its taste, how will it be restored again, it is no longer good for anything except to be thrown out and trampled under people's feet. We are that salt. We are that light to those around us.

Conrad Harkrider  32:03
A spiritual revival, something that was needed in the days of Zachariah and something that is needed. today. We're going to close with a song of there's something that we can do to encourage you to support you in your walk with Christ. Or if you need the prayers of this group, please come down to the front as we stand and sing
