Well, good evening, everyone. It's a pleasure to be with you tonight. Good

Johnny Felker  00:06
to see you. Thank you again for the opportunity to be with you to study from the Gospel of John. Let's turn in our Bible to John chapter one deny for our for our study. I appreciate the wisdom of the elders, and setting aside these times to study from books of the Bible, like you're doing in this summer series, and especially to study the Gospel of John. And I hope that throughout the summer, you'll take time during the week to read it again. And again, because it is a wonderfully faith building book. And I'm grateful for the opportunity tonight to kind of kick off this study by looking at the opening chapter of the Gospel of John John Lee's no doubt as to the method and purpose of writing this book, he tells us in John chapter 20, many other signs Therefore, Jesus also performed in the presence of his disciples, which are not written in this book. But these are written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and believing you might have life or you may have life in his name. In his gospel, John recounts seven miracles of Jesus eight, of course, if you include the resurrection, and what they tell us about him and how people reacted to them, and his stated goal in presenting them is to give evidence for faith, that he is the Christ, the Son of God, and that those who believe will experience the life that he came to bring. But before John tells the stories that lead to faith, He gives us a preview of what he hopes we'll see in those accounts or what we should believe, after reading them. And thus, the Gospel of John begins with a prologue or a foreword, if you please, that anticipates the key points and, and concepts of his gospel. And this, of course, is one of the greatest statements of faith about Jesus in all of scripture. But the question is, what does it tell us about him? Tonight, we're going to try to let the apostle John tell the story of Jesus. And that story of Jesus begins long before the manger scene. What John does, as he begins the book and this forward is give us a, a picture of the story of Jesus, he recounts kind of the theological journey, so to speak, that will be on or you will be on as you study through the Gospel of John. So first of all, John wants us to see that Jesus was the eternal God, who created all things. And so he begins with these words, in the beginning, was the word. And of course, John statement connects Jesus with the opening words of Scripture, in the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth. And as the proceeds, you'll hear many linguistic connections between John one and the creation account of Genesis, chapter one, you'll hear words like light and darkness and life. These are terms that that John will be using to talk about a new creation, because Jesus is not only the source of the original physical creation, he's also the creator of a new spiritual creation, described in this chapter. And so when there's opening chapter, John makes clear that Jesus existed before the beginning of the created universe, or as Paul would put it, in Colossians. One, He is before all things, and in him all things hold together. Colossians one verse 17, over John chooses to describe him in this passage as the word kind of an unusual way of thinking about Jesus. But the idea is not that Jesus is some kind of abstraction or the spoken word or breadth of God, but the idea is that he is the one who reveals God to man. And so the concept is that of God's self revelation in Jesus, and thus Jesus is given the title or the descriptive, the word of God. And the meaning of that will become clear to us later as we study. So in the beginning was the Word and John says the Word was God. So when Jesus was in the beginning, the application is clear. He is God, he is deity. And he is the god of Genesis one verse, one that created the heavens in the earth, and He has all the attributes of deity. And so we're able to see here in the first chapter of the Gospel of John, that the God who created the Heaven in the earth was not a single personality, but a perfect union. Oh, have at least two and as the Bible teases this out three persons, the father who here in John one is, is referred to as God, the son who is here in John one referred to as the word and of course, the third person of the divine nature, the Holy Spirit. And so the Word was God, John says, And the third thing he affirms is the same was in the beginning with God and that add something else to our understanding the word existed in the presence of the Father and loving unity and glory. And later in John will hear Jesus in your study, in his prayer in John chapter 17. To the father, now glorify thou me together with the self father, with a glory I had with the before the foundation of the before the world was. And so here, John is taking that that thought that Jesus expressed and putting it here in his prologue, the same was in the beginning with God, and so has one in essence with the Father, Jesus was also the creator of all things. So verse four tells us, all things were made by Him reverse three, rather, all things were made by Him, and without him was not nothing was was without him, nothing was made that has been made. John affirms, of course, that Jesus was himself, the Creator of all things that were created. And as the creator of all things made, he himself, of course, is excluded from things made, obviously. And so he was not merely the first created thing that God made, as the Jehovah's Witnesses would say, and translate this passage earlier, the and God and the Word was a god as they like to translate it, but rather, He is the eternal God who created all things. And with this, this again, the apostle Paul agrees, he, he writes, In Colossians, 116, four by Him, all things were created, both in the heavens and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities, all things have been created by him. And for him, we're told

Johnny Felker  07:20
that creative power, of course, will be seen throughout the Gospel of John and the mighty miracles that Jesus performed, showing his divine creative power in so many different ways, as John records the various signs that he performs, and I'm sure you'll be studying those throughout the summer. So the first thing John wants to communicate to us in the opening section is that Jesus was the eternal God, who created all things, and that is the beginning of the story. But the second thing John wants us to see is that he entered our world of darkness in order to illuminate it. So John starts with Jesus nature as God and he says to us, in Him, verse four was life, and the life was the light of man, and the light shines in the darkness, and the darkness did not comprehend it. For us, life is a gift given by God, but for Jesus, life is intrinsic, we shall say to his, to his nature as God. To put it another way, we have life from him, he has life in himself. That's the very language that Jesus used in John 526. For Justice, the Father has life in himself, even so he gave to the Son also to have life in Himself. And those John says in him, was life. And this divine life, in all of its qualities is the source of our illumination. It becomes a light to reveal God to us. You see, ours was and is, of course, a world of darkness. It is a world of ignorance, it is a world of sin. But Jesus came into the world to illuminate that darkness, he came into the world to reveal God to us and us as the word. We have God's self disclosure. In, in Jesus. That's why Jesus said, When He healed the blind man, I am the light of the world. Earlier he said in the chapter before, I'm the light of the world, he who follows me shall not walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life. That's what John wants us to say about Jesus, that the life was the light of man, and he says, this light could not be well, the translations will differ, some will say, the darkness to have not comprehended or some will say the The Darkness could not overpower it. And the term that is used there in the regional language could be used in both senses. So, commentary is sometimes very their explanations, some choosing one, some choosing the other and some suggesting a motive Vaillant meaning the idea that maybe John has left it purposely ambiguous so that we might think of both ideas. But whichever it is, we could say that if the light is not overpowered, it was suggested the ultimate victory of the light over the darkness. But if we read it as comprehended, it is not comprehended. It anticipates the rejection of the light by the world, because it didn't grasp or it didn't get the message that the light was that the word was trying to communicate. So amazingly, here we have this picture of God, coming into the world, the God who in his own person is light and life coming into a world of darkness, and in order to illuminate the darkness of this world. Well, surely such an important event is that would call for some special announcement, don't you think? Consequently, God sent a prophet to announce, he is coming. John tells us in the next verse, there came a man sent from God, whose name was John, he, he came for a witness that he might bear witness of the light, that all might believe through him. He was not the light, but he came that he might bear witness of the line. Well, of course, you know, that that man sent from God was John, the baptizer. A Baptist sometimes, as he's called, who got it, even prophetically announced, would come through prophets like Isaiah Melaka, and that he would prepare the way for the coming up the Lord, the one who had revealed himself at the burning bush, the one who had been the God of Israel, he would come to his people. And so the prophets had spoken about a prophetic foreigner who would prepare the way for the Lord. And John said many things, of course, about Jesus, namely, in his testimony that, for example, he was the Lamb of God, that takes away the sin of the world. On another occasion, he says, this is the one who baptizes in the in the Holy Spirit, and in fire. But for John's purposes, he appeals to a single statement that that points to Jesus pre incarnate existence. It is recorded in verse 50, John, the apostle John says, bore witness of him and cried out, saying, This is he of whom I said, He who comes after me is, has a higher rank than I, for he existed before me. Now, all of us who study the narrative of the birth narratives of John and Jesus know who was who was born first. John was born first six months before Jesus, in fact, and, and yet John makes the astounding declaration that Jesus existed prior to him. And it was his pre existence that gave him that higher rank, and made clear that John was not the light, but he was a witness to the light that would be coming after him. And so the Prophet John came to announce the arrival of God, and the light that he would bring to the world. And thus, John adds, about the one that he testified about, there was the true light, the real light, which coming into the world, in lightens every man and of course, that that light is the word, Jesus. But John will say that in one other way, as he talks about this topic, he entered our world of darkness in order to illuminate, illuminate it, and that is, verse 14, the word John said, became flesh, and dwelt among us. Think of that the one who is God, the one who was with God, the One who created all things became flesh. The Scripture says, the word we commonly use for that is incarnation, coming into flesh. And so he entered our world as man, but that of course without ceasing to be who he had always been, and that is, and that is gone. Well, you might be aware of the fact that the early church had great debates about all this, debating the nature of Jesus earthly existence, some emphasizing the human nature of Jesus others the divine nature, so I'm trying to merge the two natures into one but but the concept that eventually won the day was the concept that in Jesus two natures existed the human and the divine in one person.

Johnny Felker  14:51
It's important maybe that we know that at least that that great debate took place. But what is important, most important is not that we somehow explain During the miracle of the Incarnation, but that we believe and acknowledge that the Creator came into our world and experience the life that we live with all of his temptations, and that yet without sin, that's the thing we need to really take hold of and grasp, that God came into our world and lived our life and experienced our trials and our temptations and our sorrow and our suffering. He entered into our world of darkness, and that in order to eliminate, John uses another interesting word, here's Well, The Word became flesh and dwelt among us. And here, John uses a word that is related to the, the concept of a tent, or even it was the word he was used in the Greek Old Testament for the tabernacle. It's a kindred word that it's the idea of dwelling in a in a tent. And so as the Old Testament tabernacle became the, the dwelling of God among Israel to reveal His presence and glory, you remember that reading in the book of Exodus, so God now takes resonance in the tan of flesh, to reveal His presence and glory, He, we might even translate he tabernacled among us, he took up his tent among us, and in fact that language itself is suggested because it shows that Jesus fulfills all the types of the mosaic sanctuary. I have a lesson series I like to do which I show talk about Jesus in the tabernacle. And I think we can successfully show from the scripture that he's the author that makes atonement. He's the laborer that cleanses he's the menorah that enlightens, he's the bread of the presence that provides fellowship, he's the inner, he's the incense which intercedes, the torn veil, which gives access to the eternal presence of God, the author of the new covenant, the divine king enthroned above the chariot, all of those things that Moses had enacted, and, and brought into existence. All were signs pointing to the One who would come and tabernacle, or take his tent among us. And so he entered our world of darkness in order to illuminate it. When we think of the wonder, of His coming to earth, one might have expected, of course, that such a coming of God in the flesh would produce the most hospitable and glorious welcome recorded in human history. If it were true, that God should come down on the planet. What kind of reaction would one expect that to bring about? They didn't bring out the one that one might have expected. Because the third thing John wants to tell us is this that he was rejected by the world he had made, and even by zone. So John continues in verse 10, he was, he was in the world. And the world was made through him, it is his creation that he came into, and the world did not know me, and they did not recognize him or acknowledge him. He came to His own, and those who were his own, did not receive. So John shows us an amazing truth about God's entry into the world and the person of the word namely, that the Creator of all things came into his own creation. And those He created, did not know who he was, had changed most of the day either has, but even more, he came into the world of his own people, the Jews, who had heard his voice, centuries before had been given his law, exhorted by His Word through the prophets been delivered countless times by His power, it is this very God that they had supposedly worship and serve and had experienced all these things that has come among them and yet they don't know who he is. They did not they did not even welcome him. No, they they did not give him the deserved and expected response they did far worse. You know the answer to that they they rejected that even crucifying they took his life worse kind of hostility and stuff.

Johnny Felker  19:40
John had to write about his own people in chapter 12 For though he had performed so many signs for them I'm sorry should not advance this flood yet. For though hit before so many signs before them, yet they were not believing in Him. That the word of us They have a prophet might be fulfilled which he spoke. Lord who has believed our report, and to whom has the arm of the Lord been revealed? You recognize that passage. what John is saying is God came into our world, he showed himself to be God by the mighty miracles that he performed. And yet he would have rejected by the very people that should have been the first to believe in the eternal God who made all things became the suffering servant of this passage, Isaiah 53, that John quotes, who died for our sins, and became the one that John testified the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world. And so he was rejected by the world that He had made, and even by his own people, even to the point of taking his life. And yet John, as he tells the story, tells us that there were and there are those who saw him and who believed in Him. And so we might add this final statement that is that, to those who see His glory and believe in Him, He gives His grace. John says in verse 14, in contrast to some who had rejected the Lord and refused to come to Him, we, the hill, his glory, we saw it, we saw his glory, we saw the glory of the light of the word, who came to illuminate the start where we saw that light, we saw the glory that came forth from him, glory as of the only begotten from the Father, full of grace, and truth. When did the disciples see that, all the rest of the world mass They saw His glory, the Scripture says they, by glory, we mean of course, the the the outward shining of his England person as the light of the world. And of course, God's glory has always been seen in many ways. In the creation, The heavens declare the glory of God, the firmament shows His handiwork. But what we see here is God bringing his glory into the world and the person of Jesus. They saw His glory. They saw it in his miracles, they saw it in his teaching. They saw it in his personality, they saw it in his crucifixion, they saw it in his resurrection. And such things, John says, we saw that Jesus was no mere man. What we saw was someone who we could only describe as the only begotten of the Father, the only begotten from the Father, full of grace and truth. When all these things declare about Jesus was that he was the unique, one of a kind, Son of God. And as the Son of God, he was full of grace and truth for those who would be willing to receive it. John speaks out of the experience of man who lived under the Law of Moses, these disciples had been born under the law, they had grown up in a culture that honored Moses as the great prophetic lawgiver of the past. But what they saw in Jesus was someone far greater whose word would not bring spiritual death as law would bring, but rather eternal life. And John explains For the Law was given through Moses, grace and truth were realized through Jesus Christ, Moses, revealing all the justice and righteousness of God, but the Word and His person revealed the grace of God. John says, Moses revealed in the law, the presence of God and types and, and shadows of the Old Testament economy, but the word reveal God's presence in truth. And in reality, it's my God, John earlier referred to him as the true light, the the real light that illuminates man in his darkness, because it comes directly from God Himself in Jesus has found the most complete declaration of God possible. And so John says in verse 18, no man is seeing God in any time.

Johnny Felker  24:30
The only begotten God, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has explained him with some transparency, declared him and thus now we began to grasp the significance of Jesus as the the word because he declares, he explains he becomes the self revelation of God demand through his life and through his light, and thus, we're able to see See how that he gives us the fullest and most complete picture of who God he is. Sometimes people when they read that will say but doesn't. Does the scripture tell us about people seeing God? In the Old Testament? Yes, people in the Old Testament were said to see God in a sense, but only in what we might call a theory of fanic or anthropomorphic way, not in his full essence. But to see Jesus Christ is really to see God Himself. And Jesus said toe to soda fell. If you remember that conversation of John 14, Philip says to him, show us the Father, and it will be sufficient for us. Jesus said, to Philip, how about have I been so long with you? And yet you've not come to know me, Philip, He who has seen me has seen the Father, how do you say, show us the fall? It was what prompted that Hebrew writer to write in one of those other great Crosta ologies of the New Testament book of Hebrews. In his opening verses, he is the radiance of His glory, and the exact representation of his nature, to see Jesus, to see the glory of Jesus and to see the father is to see God to really see God as he's never been seen by man. And, of course, he now enjoys, as the risen Lord, the close fellowship that he once had with the Father in heaven, which we were talking about earlier, in the bosom of the Father here, and of course, his present tense, a beautiful portrayal of the intimate relationship with the Father and the Son. He has gone back to be with his father, but he has left behind all these wonderful blessings to those who see His glory. And believe in Him, He gives His grace. Here's how John put that but obvious, fullness. You see, we live in this world of empty people. And they're looking for something to put in side. And they try all these things, none of which will fit, none of which will fail them.

Johnny Felker  27:18
But the reality is, the fullness has been available to us all, in Jesus, and in God, He has come to fill us. And all of his fullness, John said, we have all received, Jesus came to give to us out of His fullness, fullness of His life, His life, His grace, His truth. Or to put it in another language, Paul says, He has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly places in Christ. Ephesians, one, three. And this grace comes to us in continual supply, never exhausted. For those who continue to walk in the light, grace upon grace, it kind of gave me the image of sitting on a shore of the ocean, you know, and you think, as those waves come crashing in is that the last one, and they never stopped, they just keep coming again and again. And so it is with good, the grace and the blessing of God, it never stopped, it just keeps coming, multiplies again and again, to those who believe and to those who walk in the light. Well, the point I'm making here courses is those who see His glory and believe in Him, He gives His grace. And so in contrast to those that rejected the Christ, those of his own, they did not receive him, John does offer another alternative and that is to put our faith in Jesus to see His glory to to respond to Him and who he is. And so John rights for as many as received him to them, he gave the right to become the children of God, even to those who believe in his name, who were born not of blood, nor the will of the flesh, nor the will of man, but of God. And so John shows us how we can share in this fullness of the only begotten Son it is, is it is about believing in Him by trusting in Him by receiving Him by being spiritually born again so that we can become spiritual children of God. Notice John was quick to point out to us with extended terms that this is not about a physical birth, brought about by man's will to have a child or by some participation of a man and woman, their blood joined together by by ethnic descent, as a Jew, but but this is a different kind of birth. It's a spiritual birth, brought about by the will of God. He's the father you In this case, James put it this way and the exercise of his will. The exercise of his will, he brought us forth by the word of truth, so that we might be, as it were the first fruits among his creatures. This blessing that we've been talking about of grace and all the benefits of grace as appropriated by, as John says, By receiving Him, that is by accepting Him into our lives as what he is as the Christ of Old Testament scripture as the Savior who came to deliver us from our sins as the Lord as Paul said and cautions to sixth Christ Jesus, the Lord receiving Christ Jesus the Lord Colossians, two, six, or to put it another way. It's appropriated by believing in His name, these are somewhat parallel terms to receive Jesus is to believe in his name, it is to acknowledge and respond to who he is trusting in and acting upon who he is, and who he is said to be in Scripture. It is, as Jesus would later explain to, to Nicodemus a birth not of, of a physical nature, but one which takes place through water, and the Spirit, the Holy Spirit.

Johnny Felker  31:19
Paul would call it Titus three, five, a washing, regeneration and a renewing by the Holy Spirit. And if you want to put that in terms of our response to God, we could put it this way, as Paul did for your all the sons of God, for children of God, through faith in Christ Jesus, for all of you who were baptized into Jesus Christ, have closed your sails with Christ, the process by which we become children of God's very clearly defined in Scripture. It is by trusting in who Jesus is, it is by receiving Him in faith and repentance and confession, and culminating in baptism in which we become a part of the family of God. And as we could say, John comes full circle to tell us that the one who created the world in the beginning, is in fact, the same one who is the creator of a new creation, a spiritual family that belongs to God, and his destined for eternal life with Him what a story. John tells us in these 18 verses, I know I've had to kind of rush us through it. But I hope that you'll read these passages again and again, because John wants us to see who what it is he wants us to get from his gospel here. The prologue of John then tells us the story of Jesus and all of its richness and depth. It declares a simple and powerful message, which will be derived by reading the evidence of John's gospel. And as you study the gospel this summer, I hope that you'll keep this text in your mind as a reference point, it was kind of serendipity that it turned out I'm presenting this lesson tonight because we change places with another speaker. But where would be a better place to start studying the Gospel of John than in studying John chapter one, verses one to 18. Keep it in mind, as you continue to hear the various speakers throughout this summer and use it constantly as a reference point as you read these different stories about Jesus because John is telling you what you're going to get what you need to get out of those out of those stories. Here it is, the eternal God, who created all things came into our world to illuminate it. He was rejected by the world he made and even by his own people, but to those who see His glory and believe he is the source of light, life, Grace, truth, and divine sonship. That's in a word, the message that John wants to communicate that is the message of John one 118. This is the message that John hope to bring before our spiritual eyes in the course of his presentation. Here's what He wants us to do. He wants us to, to watch Jesus, every action, listen to every word marveled at his miracles, listen to his claims, take in his sermons, evaluate the testimony that he gives, look at the reactions that people make, so that we can eliminate in the end, see His glory, and believe in who he is. And that in believing, we can have the life and the illumination and the understanding of God that He came to bring to us. In a word is exhortation to us is see His glory. receive His grace. That's the gospel invitation. To all of us. God came into our world. He came to save us. He came to eliminate us. He came to deliver us out of a world of darkness. He came to to bring us into His eternal presence in the person of his Son, Jesus of Nazareth. See his glory? receive His grace. Have you? Have you? I hope so. I believe that many of you have. You have a relationship with the word, beautiful relationship with him. But if you don't tonight, I've mentioned to you I've already spoken about how you can become a part of that family, new creation that Jesus came to bring about.

Johnny Felker  35:51
To put your trust in Christ. Leave the life of sin, leave the darkness behind come to the light. It will expose the sin but you can repent of that, put it behind you begin a new life of forgiveness. Join with him in baptism and his death and burial and resurrection to be raised to walk in newness of life. If you once knew Jesus and you've turned away from him witness be the time to turn back to come back to him to see him for who he is and acknowledge Him for who He is. And if we can be of help to you in either way. Tonight, we will have this opportunity for you to come and make known what your needs are. The brethren here will assist you as we stand together and as we sit
