Good morning. Good to see everyone here today, I'll say good morning, I was like I still made the cut off. I think I said that last week too. It's good to worship with you. And I'm very glad to be able to be here with you appreciate the song that was led as we think about our blessings. We are truly blessed. In many ways, as Jim mentioned, we do have some issues and challenges we have at this time. But we have freedom in Christ, we have so many blessings, and we need to be thankful for all those. So one of those as was already mentioned, I'm thankful just to be here with you and appreciate your attendance and you're worshiping with me. Have you ever noticed that you're a little more guarded with people that you don't know. In fact, that's part of what friendship is, as you begin to know someone more become friends, you begin to tell them more of who you are, and they begin to tell you more of who they are, you get to know each other. And that involves opening up your heart opening up more of who you are, and letting them in letting them know. And so when we begin to become friends with someone, we develop a greater level of trust and intimacy. Those seem to go hand in hand don't as we open ourselves up, we trust someone and we may open ourselves up a little more, the more that we trust them. That's a beautiful thing. That's really friendship. And that's a beautiful thing. But there's also a potential for a violation of that trust. And when that happens, that is called the trail. And betrayal is a horrible thing. It's where pain is is great, isn't it? Because we have opened up our hearts and as we've opened up our hearts, if that trust is violated, then it is a painful experience. The greater the trust built up between people, the greater the betrayal. You know, when a leader public official betrays the public, the public trust, it hurts and it disobeys many. When a neighbor violates our trust, often there are problems that are created between neighbors. And those may last even for many years. When a friend betrays our trust, the betrayal is great, it can have the potential of destroying that friendship, and it can be very painful. One of the greatest trusts that you can have really is in the marriage relationship. And in marriage, there's normally a period of courtship, there's this filled with time filled with excitement, anticipation, there's this opening up, and a couple will take years and years getting to know each other more and more. At the wedding ceremony. There's vows of love, commitment, and loyalty. And all that is a beautiful thing is God wants marriage to be an intimate relationship between two people. But sadly, it's also a time when there is a great potential for harm, and for hurts and for pain. It's the playground for betrayal, as many people do not honor the commitments that they have made.

Jeremy Sweets  03:14
And that's the sad thing is it's a very sad thing in the book of Hosea, the book of Hosea, so if you want to open your Bibles there, I think we see God's relationship with his people being an intimate close relationship of trust. But Israel violates that trust. I copied my PowerPoint over this morning, but I think our interconnect internet connection was bad, it didn't get copied over so I'm going to use my fingers to PowerPoint this morning. So you'll have to follow along with me. The sermon title this morning, if you're taking notes is the Lord's delight, the Lord's delights and will ultimately end up in Hosea six, verse six, the Lord's delights, Hosea six, verse six. But before we get there, let's establish some context. And we'll start in chapter two, we see steps involved in this relationship in which the bridge between Israel and God grows. First of all, you see this covenant relationship that was made at Mount Sinai as God made a covenant with His people. And Exodus chapter 19. In verse six, it uses the language that that I will be your God and you will be my people. That's almost a marriage language, isn't it as they are to be part of one another and to be in close relationship? It wasn't too long though before Israel violates that trust we see in Exodus 32, that, that they bow down and worship a golden calf and what's the first law of the Covenant was not to have any other Gods not to follow after idols yet Israel violated that as you go throughout the Old Testament. You see pattern of Israel violating God's trust. And you'll notice that it always goes in one direction. It is never a God that falls down on his part. It is never God that is faithless, it is always Israel. Notice that that takes place and that's revealed in the book of Hosea. Hosea occurs during the period of the the kings, kings of Judah in particular of Hezekiah, Jeroboam and Joash. That had been right during the time as as Israel was on their decline and headed into captivity, the northern tribes that is, and in the south in Judah, we also see that they had problems of keeping their commitment with God. Notice in chapter two and verses four and five, there it says upon her children also I will have no mercy because they are children have horrid home, for their mother has played the horror she has conceived them, she who conceived them as acted shamefully for she said, I will go after my lovers who give me my bread and my water, my wool and my flax, my oil and my drink. And so as we discuss, and as I get into this, let me use my PowerPoint here. This is God's relationship with his people. And so we're going to discuss God's relationship with his people. And Hosea two verses four and five, we see adultery that has taken place, a violation of the trust that is made between God and His people. And it says that she goes after other lovers. Now we're going to see later on in this this book that that deals with idolatry, instead of being solely devoted to God, Israel goes after other idols and other gods and so they forsake the covenant with God, within this religion. Within this relationship between God and His people, we see adultery, and then we see judgment. Then we see judgment, notice in verses eight and nine, and she did not know that it was I who gave her the grain, the wine and the oil, and who lavished on her silver and gold, which they use for bail. In verse nine. Therefore, I will take back my grain and it's time and my wine and it season. And I will take away my wall and my flax, which were to cover her nakedness. God is going to take back the many blessings that He has provided to Israel. In verse 13, we see a continuation of this statement of judgment, and I will punish her for the feast days of the bales when she burned offerings to them, and adorned herself with her ring and jewelry, and went after her lovers and forgotten me, declares the Lord.

Jeremy Sweets  07:56
Can you imagine the pain that God felt as this covenant relationship had existed yet Israel decides that she will turn away from God go after other lovers. And it says, And she forgot the Lord, she forgot me, declares the Lord. What is amazing to see is that God does not simply destroy or turn his back on faithless Israel. But time and time again, he calls her back to him. And so after the adultery and after the judgment, we see God calling Israel back to himself. Notice in verse 14, there, therefore, Behold, I will allure her and bring her back into the wilderness and Speak tenderly to her. And so here's a statement of God's mercy, as he gives this here to Israel. And again in verse 19, and I will betray you to me forever I will be Trove you to me and righteousness and injustice and steadfast love and and mercy. I will betrayed you to me and faithfulness, and you shall know the Lord, despite the betrayal of trust that was committed here by Israel, God still wants her back. God is still calling her back. And that is a picture of great forgiveness, and mercy. So God is calling her back. Now notice in chapter six, verses one through three, we see that that Israel is going to make an attempt at reconciliation. Chapter six verses one through three, Israel is going to make an attempt at reconciliation. Come let us return to the Lord free as torna said he might heal us he has struck us down and he will bind us up after two days. He will revive us on the third day He will raise us up that we may live before him. Let us know let us press on to know the Lord he is going out. His going out assures the dawn he will come to us as the showers and as the spring rains that water the earth. He received a statement here that's given by Israel. And it's a little bit difficult to know from these first few verses whether this is true repentance or not. She says, I'm going to come back, I'm going to come back to you, and God will take us back. The way God responds those shows that this is a shallow repentance. This is not the type of repentance that He desires. Notice in verses four through six, what shall I do with you? Are we free? And what shall I do with you? Oh, Judah, your love is like a morning clown. Like the do that goes early away. Therefore I've been hewn by. I've Hughenden by the prophets, I have slain them by the words of my mouth, and my judgment goes forth as the light. For I desire steadfast love and not sacrifice the knowledge of God rather than burnt offerings. Here we see that God is disappointed with their attempt at reconciliation. Is this a it's a, it's as if they come back to God, without any sorrow in their heart and saying this all be fine, this all be better, God will simply take us back. But God is not pleased with their attempt at reconciliation. In fact, he says, What am I going to do with you. And we see a key verse in verse six, for high desire, steadfast love and not sacrifice, the knowledge of God rather than Bert offerings. It's not enough that they simply come back and say, I'm here, you can take me back. What God truly wants from them is their hearts. It's not enough to sacrifice. What God wants is their hearts. It's not enough to to have a history with God and to know who he is. He wants a deep, intimate knowledge. And so he says that, I want your hearts. In chapter seven, in verse 14, he's going to say they do not cry to me from their heart. And so it's not as explicit there in chapter six, one through three what the problem with her repentance is, but chapter seven, verse 14 tells us the problem, they cried to God, they came to God, but they did not do so with their hearts.

Jeremy Sweets  12:37
In contrast, we see David in Psalm 51, that displays the kind of repentance that God desires from people, not an empty repentance, not one that says, I'm simply coming back and you should be happy to have me, but one that sorrows in their sin. In Psalm 51, in verse 16, there it says, For you will not the light and sacrifice or I would give it, you will not be pleased with a burn offering the sacrifices of God or a broken spirit of broken and contrite heart, oh, God, you will not despise, you will not despise. What is it that God wants from us? Does he want us to be at worship? Does he want us to pray to him? Does he want us to do all those things? Yes, but not merely those things. Do you know you can pray and not have your heart into it? You can come to worship, you can be here and everyone around may think that you're doing exactly what you should. But if your heart is not fully committed and devoted to God, then you're wasting your time. God's not pleased with that. Does this mean that God doesn't care anything about religious observance? Does that mean that God just wants our hearts and it doesn't matter what we do out? Really, it doesn't matter if we come to worship? No, that's not the point at all. Rather, what we do out really should reflect our hearts. God wants us to worship Him and pray to Him He wants us to assemble with the saints and, and sing praises to Him but that needs to flow from our hearts. It's not enough to have the trappings of religion and have a cold heart. It's not enough to go through the motions without our hearts. This makes sense in a marriage, doesn't it? Can you imagine a man cutting his date with his mistress short because it's his wife's anniversary and he goes and he gets her a gift and he gives her the gift. She should be happy with that right? After all, I gave you your anniversary gift. What woman would be pleased with that she may have got the gift, some outward thing. She doesn't have her husband's heart if he's out with another woman does. She doesn't have his heart and that would have been a source of great pain. I can imagine the husband, cold hearted callous husbands saying, what more do you want from me? I bought you a gift. You know, that's what I picture Israel saying here. What more do you want from me? I gave you some sacrifices. I gave us some some worship. What more do you want from me? And the answer is, God desires our heart. So after we see God's relationship with his people, the second point we need to notice is God desires our hearts. God desires our hearts. And Hosea six and verse six. There it says, For I desire steadfast love. This word for steadfast love can be translated in many ways. And it's all encompassing of this picture of the trust between two committed parties, like a marriage or or covenant that is made. And it can include loving kindness and its definition, steadfast love as we see in the the ESV. Grace, mercy, faithfulness, goodness, devotion. All of those are, are wrapping up our are showing us what it means to be in a committed relationship, in a devoted relationship, one of true love. So God desires our hearts, God desires according to this text, steadfast love and not sacrifice. And again, I don't think I don't think the text is saying God does not want sacrifice. I think the force of this statement is that God wants loyalty or steadfast love and not merely sacrifice, and not merely sacrifice. And that's just as true today. God desires a true knowledge of Him, and not mere burn offerings or mere attendance at worship service. God desires melody in our hearts, and not merely acapella music. It's not enough to do the right thing. He wants our hearts. God desires a prostrated hearts, and not just church attendance. God desires, godly and faithful spouses, and not those that will simply say we'll just stay together for the kids. God desires a thankful and truthful heart or a truthful heart not just those that will tell truth under oath, or if they're made to by the government, but one that is truthful at heart.

Jeremy Sweets  17:34
God desires that we would remember his son with thankfulness and appreciation in our hearts, not merely in jest, unleavened bread and fruit of the vine. He wants that to come from our hearts. God desires a moral, godly, holy life, and not just a profession of being a Christian. Yes, God wants you to profess his name and being a Christian, but that has to be coupled with that has to flow from a person's heart. God desires our hearts. Third, let's notice true satisfaction. True satisfaction or ultimate fulfillment. The adulterer thinks that satisfaction is found in adultery, the adultery Thanks, that's, that's exciting. That's gonna make me happy. That's going to give me everything that I want. But Hosea points out that the adulterer simply chasing after the wind, striving after what is impossible to catch. What they think is satisfaction is an illusion. It's not truly found there. Satan is a master liar and manipulator promising a lot of what he cannot deliver. Satan continually promises satisfaction, but he never delivers on that. Sin only gives us heartache. And Hosea two and verse five notice this illusion that is sought for she said, I will go after my lovers who give me my drink, my bread, my water, my wool and my flax, my oil and my drink. My lovers provide everything that I need everything that I could want. She says in chapter eight and verse seven, though, we see what is involved in this for they so the wind and they will reap the whirlwind. There's no true satisfaction found in the adultery and physical Dortch Daltry, or the spiritual adultery here of Israel. The adulterer makes the mistake that is common in our country. And that is the mistake of believing that the grass is greener on the other side. It's better over there, whatever I have is not good enough and whatever they have is plenty enough to make me happy. But that is not where true satisfaction is found. In fact, there's a problem with that mentality. By looking at the greener grass on the other side, you ignore what you have the blessings that you do have, you ignore that. And you also ignore something on the other side, you ignore the problems that are over there. And so the grass is not always greener. That's a lie that we tell ourselves. That's a lie that Satan tells us, the grass is always greener, it's not always greener. And again, I point to Satan and his role. In all this. He's a master manipulator. If he can get us to focus on what we don't have and say there's satisfaction there will never be happy. We'll never find true fulfillment. It may look nice over there. But the grass is not always greener. Looking at greener pastures, led lot in a certain direction didn't lead him in the path, the path of Sodom and Gomorrah, pursuing greener pastures is simply a fool's errand. It's like we're chasing the Mirage. Out there, you can imagine someone in a desert or dry desert and they're chasing the Mirage. And as they do that they run past the well of water that's there. That's what it's like to look for the greener grass on the other side, or to chase after adultery is to chase after this false picture, of enjoyment and of joy. The truth is, is that we can find fulfillment in God and we need to find fulfillment in God. We may twist one of the Beatitudes to say it like this curse it are those who hunger and thirst after sin, for they shall be disappointed. When we seek after sin and its promises, we may have this, this grand view of that's going to make me happy, but it fails to deliver. It fails to deliver. I've probably used this example many times, but I can't help but think about beer commercials. I know streaming services have kind of changed the way commercials happen. I told our kids we used to have to watch commercials through every show. But there used to be a lot of beer commercials on TV and boy that looked fun. They'd have a beer commercial and they were partying and everyone was smiling and laughing and

Jeremy Sweets  22:31
you know, if I didn't know anything about beer or anything like that, I'd look at that sale. That's what I want. Well, that's what the advertisers want you to believe. But what is the reality of alcohol? Is it only joyful parties? Now they don't show the reality of someone that kills someone because they were driving drunk. Or they don't show the sickness that comes and hanging over the toilet. They don't show the broken friendships or the the blackouts where people are acting away. They don't remember. Satan is a master manipulator, promising phone, but delivering heartache. True satisfaction is found in God and not in sin. In Psalm 37, in verse four there it says, delight yourself in the Lord. And He will give you the desires of your heart. Joy is to be found in God find your delights in him. And Isaiah 58 Verse 11. And the Lord will guide you continually and satisfy your desire in scorch places, and make your bones strong. And you shall be like a watered garden, like a spring of water whose water do not fail, whose waters Do not fail. God will satisfy your desire in a scorch place, God will bring you true fulfillment, and happiness. And so now as returned to that beatitude that we just mentioned, blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness for they shall be filled. And so we find that there is a fulfillment that is to be found in God. And so we've looked at the relationship that God had with Israel, we've we've looked at the fact that God wants our hearts. We've also seen that there's true satisfaction, ultimate fulfillment found in God. And let's notice one other point here, and that is God's pain, God's pain. God understands the pain of unfaithfulness. There's one charge we cannot levy against God. When we experience pain and heartache. We cannot look to God and say you don't understand because God understands all too well. God understands the heartache and pain of a committed relationship and where one turns their back on that room. relationship and he understands that time and time again, we see that in the Scriptures with Israel. He understands and knows the pain of rejection. And he knows the sorrow of the betrayal, of trust. God knows pain. God also understands pain through His Son, Jesus Christ. He sent His Son to die on the cross. That was not a joyful experience. That was not something he delighted in as far as the process and what was required. It was a source of pain and death for his son. But he did that because he loves you and me, He endured the pain because of His great love. And the same is true of Jesus Christ. And Hebrews 12 And verse two, it says, for the joy set before Him, He endured the cross, and despise the shame. It was because of, of what it would produce, or what would come about because of it, your salvation, the forgiveness of our sins, Christ died for you. So yes, God knows about true pain that comes from from betrayal, and from adultery. But he is willing to endure some pain, and he always wants us to come back. He's unwilling to endure some pain for our benefit. And that is true love. And that is true. Let me conclude with this thought. God loves you. And he wants to be in an intimate close relationship with you. He doesn't want you to have some, again, mere trappings of religion, some do some outward things, but keep your heart to yourself. God wants and desires your true heart. Nothing would make God happier than for you to live your life as a faithful Christian. And if you're here this morning, and you're not a Christian, you have an opportunity to obey the gospel message. In James four, in verse eight, it says, Draw near to God, and He will draw near to you. That's the beauty of a marriage or any intimate relationship is that it is satisfying for both parties as they grow closer together and find enjoyment and joy within each other. God can find that in you and you can find that in God.

Jeremy Sweets  27:23
When Jesus told the parable of the last land, the last one and the 99, that were safe. It concludes that parable by saying, in the same way I tell you, there is joy in the presence of the angel of God over one sinner who repents. We talked about the fact that if you're not a Christian, you have an opportunity to become a Christian. If you're a sinner, in the sight of God, you have an opportunity to to delight. We often say the angels, sometimes we say the angels are rejoicing, but the New American Standard says, it's the in the presence of God. That may be God Himself, who's rejoicing. I think both are rejoicing, don't you? I think angels are rejoicing around God who himself is overjoyed. When a sinner leaves the way of sin and comes to him. The angels are in the presence of Almighty God. You can delight our Lord our God, by obeying the gospel. And if you're not living as you should, you can delight the Lord by putting away your sin and coming back to him if you're a Christian and not living, as you said, whatever the situation is, true fulfillment is found in God. And if you've not made that commitment, I would ask that you would do so this very day. There's any subject to the invitation. Please come as we stand in scene at this time.
