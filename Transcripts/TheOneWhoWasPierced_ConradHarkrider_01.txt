Good morning, if you want to be opening up your Bibles to Zachariah, the 12th chapter. That's the second to last book in the Old Testament. sometimes have to say the order to try to remember where that is. But that's what we're going to be studying this morning. Zachariah, chapter 12. Our theme in 2020 has been seeing Jesus, the idea that we want to have better perspective, better vision, better clarity on who Jesus is, and what he means to us. And how that changes our lives. Have you ever had the experience of seeing something and realizing that you hadn't noticed it in the past? Maybe it was always there, but it just had never caught your attention before. We were driving along one of the streets that's very close to our house. And we noticed that there was a grave site, a family grave site with several headstones. And I asked my wife, have you ever noticed that before? And she said, No. I'm usually looking at the road when we drive past. But it's a place that we have gone by hundreds of times that yet it has never stood out to us. In John chapter 19, as John is recounting the events of the crucifixion of Jesus, he quotes from two Old Testament passages. He says that not a bone would be broken, and that they would look upon the one whom they had pierced. I wonder how many of his listeners Jews that had grown up for their whole lives studying, hearing listening to those words, and yet had never made the connection. They had never seen the Messiah. They didn't make the association with Jesus. Well, this morning, we want to look at this text from Zechariah 12, the, the source of one of these prophecies about the one who was pierced. And we want to think about what the Old Testament has to say about Jesus, one of the best ways to see Jesus is to look back at the things that the prophets and those have old said about him. And that can give us a better understanding a greater perspective on who he was, and what he came to do. So think with me this morning about the one who was peers and read with me from Zachariah, chapter 12, beginning in verse 10. It says, I will pour out on the house of David and the inhabitants of Jerusalem, a spirit of grace and pleas for mercy so that when they look on me, on him, whom they have pierced, they shall mourn for Him, as one mourns for an only child, and we bitterly over Him as one weeps over a firstborn. On that day, the morning in Jerusalem will be as great as the morning for Hey, Dad, Ramon, in the plane of Megiddo. The land shall mourn each family by itself, the family of the house of David by itself and their wives by themselves, the family of the house of Nathan by itself and their wives by themselves, the family of the house of Levi by itself and their wives by themselves, the family of the shimmy it by itself and their wives by themselves, and all the families that are left, each by itself, and their wives by themselves. On that day, there shall be a fountain open for the house of David, and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to cleanse them from sin, and uncleanness.

Conrad Harkrider  04:36
The section that we just read is part of an Oracle, a heavenly statement, a prophecy that God makes in the first nine verses of chapter 12 are about Jerusalem and its relationship to the nations around it. And it is a picture of great Victory, that God would protect his people that he would help them to withstand the attacks and the assaults from the nations around them. They would not just survive these attacks, but they would overwhelm their enemies. He describes them as a flaming torch, in the midst of a field, a dry field, it's a picture of great victory for God's people. But starting in verse 10, the mood of the texts begins to shift. There's a dramatic change in the feeling and the emotion the word mourn or mourning is used five different times. In verses 10 through 14. He talks about great weeping that will come from the people. The spirit of triumph that was described in the first part of the chapter has now turned to a spirit of grief and sorrow. In verse 10, he says, that he is going to pour out a spirit of grace and pleas for mercy, a spirit of grace and pleas for mercy. This pouring out reminds us of other Old Testament passages that describe God's Spirit being poured out passages like Joel chapter two and verse 28. That tells of a time when God's Spirit would be poured out on all flesh. We read about the fulfillment of that and Acts chapter two on the day of Pentecost, when the Holy Spirit was given to the disciples and they were able to speak in tongues and proclaim the gospel message for the very first time. But this is going to be poured out on the house of David and the inhabitants of Jerusalem.

Conrad Harkrider  06:56
God's grace will be poured out His grace is his favor. It's his kindness. It's the love and the mercy that he extends to his people. And this is not just going to be poured out and then there's nothing that happens, but the pleas for mercy. That is the response that happens from the people when this grace is poured out. The idea is that when people are the recipients of God's grace, when we are blessed by the gifts of God that demands a reaction, a response from us, there is a sense of repentance, a desire to confess, to acknowledge wrong to ask God for forgiveness, and for his favor. We see one of these examples of a plea for mercy, this supplication that is offered to the Lord and Daniel chapter nine, verses four through five. And Daniel says, I pray to the Lord my God and made confession saying, Oh Lord, the great and awesome God who keeps covenant and steadfast love with those who love Him and keep His commandments. We have sinned and done wrong and acted wickedly, and rebelled, turning aside from your commandments, and rules. You can see Daniels making this petition to God and he's acknowledging the things that they have done the wrongs and the sins that they've committed. This is a plea for God's mercy. We're given some additional information here about how all this is going to happen. And he says that they will look on Me whom they have pierced. They will look on me, well, who is it that is speaking here? This is the Lord. He is talking in the first person, he's telling them the things that are going to happen to him. Perhaps they also may have thought that this was in reference to one of his servants like Zachariah himself, or maybe one of the leaders and chapter in Zechariah, chapter 13. In verse seven, it will talk about the shepherd over God's people. But he says here that the people will look on me to look on someone is not just to stare at them, to see them to acknowledge their presence. But rather it implies this idea of trust, of dependence of reliance upon someone. Imagine if you were carrying something very heavy into the house and one of your family members or friends was standing right there, and you gave them a look. What are you trying to convey to them you're not just trying to see where they are in the room but right Whether you're it's a look of request, it's saying, I need a hand, can you help me with this. And so they are looking upon him for deliverance for aid, for rescue, because they understand that he is the one that has great power. In Numbers chapter 21, and verse nine, it says, So Moses made a bronze serpent and set it on a pole. And if a serpent serpent bits anyone, he would look at the bronze serpent, and live, the people had been punished for their sinfulness with these snakes that had gone out into the camp, and they were causing these fatal bites. And Moses provides a source of relief and salvation that those who would look on the bronze serpent could be healed. It wasn't just a matter of seeing something, but rather they were trusting. They believe that doing this would allow them to be healed, that God could save them. So in Zechariah, 12, they are looking on him on me, on the one they have pierced. The Lord has been pierced. It is amazing to think that we could do anything that would garner the attention of the eternal supreme being of the universe.

Conrad Harkrider  11:40
We are down here on a speck of dust and yet the all powerful creator takes notice. He is aware of the things that we do and not just aware, but he is affected by them to say that he is pierced in the time of no and the Bible says that there was great wickedness upon the earth, that the thoughts and the intents of man's heart were evil continually. And in Genesis chapter six and verse five is one of the status statements in the Bible. It says that the Lord was sorry, that he had made man. When we turn against God, it's not just that we're frustrating him or that we're doing something different than what he would want. But Zechariah 12 Verse 10, says that his response is he is pierced by these things. In the Book of Zachariah, the Lord is calling His people to return. Return to me, he says in chapter one, and I will return to you. He wants His people to learn from their mistakes, to not follow the path that their fathers went down serving the worthless idols going after the false gods. And so now he is urging them to listen to the message that was rejected by their fathers. To remember that this causes God great pain, when his people go down a different path when they turn away from his word. The Lord is pierced and perhaps when the people realize this, what they have done to the Lord, the relationship that they have broken, that's the perhaps this is the reason for the mourning that is described in the following verses here. This realization that they have hurt the Lord. It's not just the Lord who is pierced, but now the people will experience great sorrow and grief for these things. He gives three examples of this morning. He says that they will mourn like one morning for an only child. They will weep as one weeping for the death of a firstborn and the morning of, Hey, Dad Rehman in the plane of Magneto. But he says that the house of David will mourn as one mourns for an only child. The loss of a child. What an inexpressible grief and tragedy, a terrible loss full of shock, anger, frustration, pain, and heartbreak. For anyone who has lost a child but especially if it is an only child or grandchild, it must be unbearable. There are a couple of other people in the scriptures that are mentioned as only children. Genesis 22 And verse two refers to Isaac. He tells God tells Abraham to take your son, your only son whom you love and offer him as a bird offering. Also in the book of Judges and Judges, chapter 11, and verse 34, Jetta, one of the judges were told that he had an only child, a daughter. Of course, we remember his legacy because of the critical role that she played in that story. But to lose an only child, what a devastating loss. When I was in college, there was one of my classmates that was tragically killed in an accident just a few months before we graduated. She was in a number of my classes, and she was incredibly smart. She was talented, she was pretty, and she was an only child. It is a loss that can never be replaced. And God is saying that that's how the people will feel. When they look upon the one who has been pierced, the depth and the intensity of their pain will be be like losing a child.

Conrad Harkrider  16:31
And what we see in the scriptures is that the Lord has compassion, and love and extends mercy for those who are hurting, at the deepest levels. In Luke chapter seven, in verse 12. It says of Jesus as he drew near to the gate of the town, behold, a man who had died was being carried out, the only son of his mother, and she was a widow, and a considerable crowd from the town was with her. And when the Lord saw her, he had compassion on her and he said to her, Do not we, the text says that adds, this procession is coming out of the town, there is a considerable crowd following and we can understand why this woman has lost her husband, she's now lost her only son. She is left without anything, but Jesus shows compassion to anyone, especially those who have the greatest needs. In Zachariah 12, this pain that is experienced by the people, is also compared to one who weeps for a firstborn. The first board had a special place of significance among the Jews, they were given a double portion of the inheritance. They were considered to be leaders of the family, they were raised to lead. They're their relatives, as they are often leaders in our families taking care of the younger ones helping with various things. But the firstborn would have had a very special place within the family. The death of the firstborn would have been incredibly devastating as it was in the 10th and final plague among the Egyptians when God went through the land and took all of the firstborn among the Egyptians. This was a pain that was experienced by Mara in the book of Ruth or Naomi, when she lost her firstborn son. Also job experienced this. And when Joshua placed a curse on the city of Jericho, he said that those who rebuilt the walls it would be at the price of their firstborn. Ultimately, God would give his firstborn son to offer salvation to the entire world, John chapter three and verse 16. But it would be as if losing that key that central that most important child that first born. And then finally he compares this to the morning for Hey, Dad, Ramon in the plane of magotteaux. We're not entirely sure what he's referring to. But perhaps this is a reference to a well known king, a beloved king who was struck, mortally struck in the plane of laghetto. In Second Chronicles, Chapter 35, in verse 22, we're told about how King Josiah went out to fight with the king of Egypt, and there was an arrow that struck him while he was in his chariot, in the plane of Magneto, and so there was great weeping and mourning over the loss of God. A leader, God's King, all three of these the loss of an only child the death of a firstborn, the plane of the magotteaux. They, they help us to see the intensity, the depth, the severity of this weeping. But verses 12 through 14, helped to show the extent of the grieving that it was not just localized among a certain group of people or among a specific family, but this was something that would affect all of the people. He goes on in verses 12 through 14 to list out a number of families. He says, The House of David the house of Nathan the house of Levi and the shimmy Eitz.

Conrad Harkrider  20:53
The House of David, of course, is the royal family, the house of Nathan Nathan was a son of David. He's mentioned in Luke chapter three in the genealogy for Jesus as the heir or the son of David. Perhaps these two houses are representative of the leaders in how they would be affected by this tragic event. Levi is a family of priests and the servants of the temple. The shimmy is were one of the clans in the house of Levi according to Numbers, chapter three, and verse 20. So there would be mourning among the leaders there would be mourning among the religious teachers, the priests, the servants in the temple. And then in verse 14, he says that all of the families that are left, all would mourn. You ever been to a funeral where there wasn't a dry eye in the building, as we say, it wasn't just the family that the the people who knew them best that are overcome with grief, but every person is moved because of what has happened. Maybe the death of a child or the death of a young parent. But this would be a morning that would encompass all of the people. Well, if the section ended right there, we might be felt, we might be left feeling hopeless, feeling despondent. We're in a state of great sadness and grief and remorse. But it continues on in chapter 13, in verse one, when he says that, on that day, there shall be a fountain open for the house of David and the inhabitants of Jerusalem to cleanse them from sin, and uncleanness. The House of David is mentioned four times in chapter 12. And it's mentioned again here in chapter 13. And verse one, this is the final time in the Book of Zachariah that the house of David will be referenced. And in this final reference, there is a tremendous promise that is made to the house of David that there will be a fountain that is opened a fountain, that imagery of water flowing out, a fountain springing forth that's common in the Old Testament. In the book of Genesis Chapter Two, we're told that there are four rivers that flow flowed out of the Garden of Eden, a place of abundance and water that flows out from that source to provide life and sustenance to the whole land. Water and fountains are also mentioned in Ezekiel chapter 47. And also in Joel chapter three, and verse 18. He says in that day, the mountains will drip with new wine and the hills will flow with milk and all the ravines of Judah will run with water, a fountain will flow out of the house out of the Lord's house, and will water the Valley of occasions. So God will provide this living water, it's going to flow out notice from where from the Lord's house that's the source of this living water. It provides refreshment and renewal. And in Zacharias time he promises to cleanse them from sin and uncleanness. So although there is this great sadness, this morning that is experienced by the people because they are looking upon the one who has been pierced, God promises to bring restoration to his people and to forgive them. Well, how does all of this connect Jesus. As we were going through that, I hope you were thinking about some of the connections and the parallels to the scene on the cross. And what happened to Jesus. When he was put to death. Zachariah chapter 12 shows us something about his manner of death. There were a number of ways that one could be executed in the ancient world. Things like hanging or removing the head or feeding a person to wild animals. But the most common and most notable form of execution was crucifixion.

Conrad Harkrider  25:45
Jesus would be tried and condemned for things that he hadn't done and be sentenced to death by crucifixion, having nails driven through his hands and feet, Jesus of Nazareth was literally pierced. But John chapter 19 makes a reference to another piercing. When victims were put on a cross, they often died from asphyxiation, they can no longer gasp for air and breathe. But when the Jews realized that they didn't want these men up on the cross for the Sabbath day, they requested that pilot would break their legs to speed up the process. And so they did with the criminals that have been crucified with Jesus. But when they came to the Lord, they found that he had already that he had already died and succumbed to the torture. And so one of the soldiers took a spear and thrust it into his side, it was a way of confirming that he was, in fact, dead.

Conrad Harkrider  26:57
And so they pierced his side. And what's amazing about this is all of these details about how Jesus would be put to death, how long it would take, what they would do to him after he died. These are all things that Jesus Himself does not have direct control over. And yet we see that Zachariah 500 years prior says that they will look upon the one who is pierced. It shows the type of death that he would suffer. Also, if we think about this piercing not in a physical sense, but also how God himself feels, we can see that there was a piercing of God the Father, when Jesus is on the cross, that was shown in a physical manifestation as the earth, the sun was darkened while Jesus is on the cross. As Jesus gives up his spirit, we're told in Matthew chapter 27, that the Earth began to shake that the rocks were split in half. And so God is pierced as his son is put to death on the cross. Zachariah 12 also helps us to better appreciate the impact that this event had on the people. Remember what we talked about the three examples, the depth, the severity of the mourning that the people experienced, as an only son, or as a firstborn, dies. And of course, Jesus is the only son of God, He is the firstborn of God. And his death, of course, would have brought a great sense of mourning to the people. Because Jesus was full of wisdom, he was full of power, he spent his life healing and teaching and helping other people and to take such an incredible gift that had been given to the world and to, to treat it so shamefully to spit in his face and then to nail Him to the cross. What a great tragedy and injustice that was done. Not only was he innocent, but he was the perfect Lamb of God. In Luke chapter 23, in verse 47, notice some of the reactions to the death of Jesus here it says, Now when a Centurion saw what had taken place, he praise God, saying, certainly this man was innocent, and all the crowds that had assembled for this spectacle when they saw what had taken place, they return home, beating their breasts. This centurion is a Roman soldier. He's a Gentile from what we can assume he does not know Jesus, he has no prior connection to him. And yet, after observing all of the things that have happened, the scene on the cross his conclusion, his reaction is to praise God. And to conclude that this man was innocent, and then also notice the crowds. In verse 48, they had come out to see a spectacle to witness this event take place. And yet, when these people returned to their homes, the text says that they beat their breasts he ever been to a movie, not really sure what it was about, or not knowing fully the content of what was in it. And after sitting there for a couple of hours, you walk out of the theater and you feel regret. You wish you hadn't have seen the things that were in front of that were put in front of your eyes, these people are feeling a sense of remorse. They realize that this man did not deserve to die. And after watching a innocent just person being put to death in front of their eyes, there is a feeling of pain and grief. They're overcome with sorrow. In Luke chapter 24, in verse 17,

Conrad Harkrider  31:37
as the two men are on the road to Emmaus, and Jesus comes up, and begins to talk with him, it says in Luke 24, in verse 17, what is this conversation that you are holding with each other as you walk, and they stood still looking sad. That was how the disciples, the followers of Jesus felt. We also know that Judas took his own life, Peter wept bitterly Mary came to the tomb, and was crying because she, she thought that the body had been stolen away. But this was an incredibly sad moment in history, like weeping for the firstborn or the death of an only child. But of course, that's not where the story ends, because Zachariah shows us that this event would bring great blessing for the world that great blessings would come from it is a terrible thing that Jesus had to give his life that he had to shed his blood. But the Lord was able to take this terrible event. This great injustice that was done to his son, he's able to turn it into something that brought blessing to the entire world. That ended up being a gift for all people for all time. As Zachariah says, there would be a fountain that would be open this spring of fresh water, a spring that is available to all people, regardless of background or race, or where they're from or their knowledge, or how they grew up. This blessing provides renewal and healing and cleansing from sin for all who would come and drink. In John chapter four, Jesus met a woman at a well outside of Sumeria. And he came up and he asked her for a drink. And she was a little surprised that he was talking to her. And he said, if you knew who it was, who was asking you for a drink, you would ask him and he would give you living water. That's what Jesus offers people today. That's what he offers all of us. It's living water. It's not something you can find in the store. You can't order it online, you couldn't travel to go and obtain it. It's only through the Lord. It's only found by coming to the Father. He can provide that nourishment that healing, that forgiveness. When we experience great morning pain, suffering, sorrow and hurt in this world, the only source of true comfort and restoration is found in the Lord. And John chapter four and verse 13. Jesus said to her, Everyone who drinks this water will be thirsty again, but whoever drinks of the water that I give him will never be thirsty again. The water that I give will become in him a spring of water welling up to eternal life. Have you drink from the water that Jesus offers? He asked that you give your life to Him, that you submit yourself to His Word, being baptized to wash away your sins, and then for the rest of your life committing yourself to follow Him and be one of his disciples. If you're not a child of God this morning, or if you have turned away from the Lord, we want to encourage you to come back to do whatever is necessary to be in the presence of God to have access to that living water. So that one day we can live with Him forever. We're going to close with a song and if there's something that we can do to help you, please come down to the front as we stand and sing
