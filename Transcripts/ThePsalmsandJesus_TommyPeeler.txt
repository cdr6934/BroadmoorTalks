Okay, and uh, David, I'm sure you've got the oh, great, okay. But he's good to be with you all, and have this opportunity. Thank you. Thank you. And thank you for your patience. And thank you, Kurt for filling in. And the book of Psalms, this, you are kind of an experiment this week, I didn't intend it to be in class this early, but but from the standpoint, I'm gonna see if I can just do a meeting on Psalms, and the vacation bible school classes will be somewhat of a sermon somewhat of a class through the week. And so we'll just try that out. And today is a brief little introduction to the Psalms. And are the Psalms a message to God? Or from God, David, if you want to press that down? Are they a message to God, or from God? I would say ultimately, the answer to that is that they're both. They're both to God from man, and yet, from God to man. Now, the significance of that is this. That if they, if the psalms are not men, writing their words to God, then what you have are a forced statement of praise in Psalms 145, to 150, you have a force statement of praise, or in Psalm 51, you have a forced confession of sin. And I don't believe that's what we have in those passages. I think we have people pouring out their heart, in the midst of good circumstances and praising him or in the midst of difficulties and problems and acknowledging, acknowledging their guilt, and they're seeing it in Lord willing, the sermon in a little while, is going to focus on Psalm 51. The Book of Psalms is a book about real people pouring out their heart, to God, it is the words of man to God, but at the same time, is the words of God. To me in the Psalms tell us how to approach God, in such circumstances. An old song in the book, does Jesus care when I've tried and failed to resist some temptation strong? When for my deep grief, there is no relief, and the tears flow all the night long? How do you approach God when your heart is broken? Psalm 51, is a good expression of that. God is directing us in the Book of Psalms, how in the midst of those difficulties, and problems of life, we approach Hill and ask him for help. So this is both man's word to God, as they're pouring out their hearts to Him. And it's God's guidance for how to relate to him in those circumstances. But it is also God's word to man, in a greater sense, in a deeper and richer sense in this regard.

Unknown Speaker  04:08
First of all, look at Luke 24. Some of you are familiar with Luke 20 fours, no doubt, I love this account only told in the Gospel of Luke, of the resurrection of Jesus, the resurrection appearance of Jesus. But there are two disciples walking back from Jerusalem to amaze us. As they are walking to Emmaus. Jesus appears and suddenly is walking with them and their eyes are prevented from recognizing healed and recognizing who he is. And the text tells us what are these things that you're talking about? In they said, Are you the only one present in Jerusalem who is unaware of the events that have happened? wouldn't hear in these days, how Jesus of Nazareth a prophet mighty and word indeed. And we believe that he was the one who was going to redeem Israel. And so women came early this morning from the tomb. And they, they said that they had seen a vision of angels that he was alive. And Jesus says, Oh foolish, is slow of heart, to believe in all that the prophets have spoken. Was it not necessary that the Christ suffer these things, and enter his glory? Verse 27, then beginning with Moses, and with all the prophets, he explained to the old the things concerning Himself, in all the scriptures. Look at verse 44, verse 44, as Jesus is meeting with his apostles, it says that these are the words which I spoke to you, while I was still with you that all things which are written about me in the law, the prophets, and the Psalms of all of Moses, and the prophets, and the Psalms must be fulfilled. The point, the Psalms speak of Jesus, Jesus has to fulfill all that is written about him in the law and the prophets. But also he explains from the law, the prophets, and the Psalms, must be fulfilled. And let me tell you something that I used to say. And it probably some of you still say, Psalms is the longest book of the Bible. Is that true or false? Is anybody bold enough? It's true. No, it's not true. is actually not, you will still see some lists. If you look up that question on the internet, which of course is a great resource for such questions. If you will still see some they'll say Psalms is longest. In actual Hebrew words, Jeremiah, is the longest book and actually there are a few longer than the Psalms. Now, that may be a bit of trivia, it may not be important in the big picture of things. But think of this, in spite of the fact that it is not the longest Old Testament book. It is the book of the Old Testament, most frequently referred to in the New Testament.

Unknown Speaker  08:01
That's a true that's true. In the fact that it's not the longest, if it was the longest, we'd say, well, obviously, it's the longest is going to be quoted most frequently. It's not the longest, and still quoted the most, that makes that fact stand out even more significantly. And one writer has stated that if you, you read through the Psalms, that there are so many events in the life of Christ, that are foreshadowed in the Psalms, and often the Psalms, quote, certain passages, they quote, certain passages from the Psalms, to to emphasize Jesus and His fulfillment of the song. Now, what we're going to try to do this week, particularly in our night lessons, is we're going to try to look at a psalm in its Old Testament context, we're going to look at it as the people who received it would have thought about it. And yet at the same time, we are wanting to see that psalm in light of all of God's revelation in Scripture, in light of all of the message that he gives in the Bible, and to see how the psalm points to Jesus and our experiences as Christians, you remember, at the transfer the baptism of Jesus, and a transfiguration of Jesus, that the Bible tells us in Matthew three verses 16 and 17, is that after being baptized, Jesus came up immediately from the water and behold, the heavens were opened, he sold the Spirit of God to sending as a dove and lighting on heel, and behold, a voice out of heaven says This is My beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased. This is My beloved Son. That seems to be an allusion and echo of Psalm two and verse seven. That passage will also be quoted at the Transfiguration of Jesus. Another passage that is combined with it is Isaiah 42 verse one, which talks about a suffering servant. But we're going to talk about Psalm two, Lord willing, sometime later in the week. And Psalm two is talking about a conquering king. You are my son today I have begotten you ask of me, and I will give you the nations as an inheritance and the ends of the earth as your possession is a conquering king who's going to control all of the world. That passage is quoted about Jesus and His baptism and his transfiguration. But it's not the only passage it's echoed there. Like we said, Isaiah 42, talks about a suffering servant and suffering servant will appear quite frequently through that part of the book of Isaiah in Isaiah 52 and 53. That servant is described as one who was wounded for our transgressions and bruised for our iniquities. The chastisement or peace was upon him, and we by His stripes, by his stripes, we are healed All we like sheep have gone astray and the Lord is laid on him the iniquity of us all. Jesus is a conquering king, but he's also a suffering servant. And he's going to conquer all through his suffering. Another vignette in the life of Jesus, where we see the Psalms referred to our Matthew six, and the temptation of Jesus, Matthew four, verse six, excuse me, and the temptation of Jesus. Now, what is different about this use of Psalms? What do you see what's different about the use of Psalms? Here in Matthew four, verse six at a critical moment in the life of Jesus? Who's quoting the verse? Satan is quoting the verse, Satan is quoting scripture. What Satan says, After Jesus, resist the temptation to turn stones to bread, because it is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God. Then in Matthew four, in verses five and six, if you are the Son of God, throw yourself down for it is written, He will command his angels concerning you in on their hands, they will bear you up so you will not strike your foot against a stone. And Jesus answered, on the other hand, it is written, You shall not put the Lord your God to the test, a quote from Deuteronomy six and verse

Unknown Speaker  13:48
16, do it six verse 16. I want to make just a brief point about Psalm 91. You think about it. I'm not exactly sure if this may not be pressing something too far, but you can think about it. You can question me about it, if you will. If you look at Psalm 91 in its original context, Psalm 91, verses 11 and 12. He will give His angels charge concerning you to guard you in all your ways. They will bear you up in their hands that you do not strike your foot against a stone. Look at verse 13, verse 13, you will tread upon lion and Cobra, the young lion and the serpent. You will trample down from Satan's first appearance in the Bible, he was a serpent A serpent was more crafty than any beast of the field. And the serpent said as God said, you shall not eat for the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. God knows that the day you eat from it, your eyes will be open and you'll be like God, knowing good and evil and hear Psalm 91 says, You will tread upon lion and Cobra, the young lion and the serpent you will trampled down. This is what I'm suggesting to you possibly, that it may be that Satan is quoting a passage that talks about his own demise.

Unknown Speaker  15:45
He may not recognize that. But Jesus certainly does. And remember, Satan said, He will give His angels charge concerning you. After the trials of Jesus were over in Matthew four in verse 11, the Bible tells us that the angels came and ministered to him. And again, this is just a shotgun approach, for some ways that the Psalms appear in critical moments of the life of Christ. Jesus teaching was based much on the Psalms not only did was his teaching based in the Psalms, it was based in both content of teaching and the type of teaching that he did. For example, Jesus says in Matthew five, verse five blesses are the gentle or the meek, for they shall inherit the earth. That's actually a quotation from the Greek version of the Old Testament, in Psalm 37, verse 11, a lot of what Jesus taught is based on the book of Psalms, and a lot of what Jesus taught the way he taught, is talked about in the Old Testament, as I will open my mouth, in parables, and I will utter things hidden since the foundation of the world. The Psalms give us insight into Christ in all of these ways, but particularly as we get closer to the end of Jesus lie. The Psalms are quoted with increasing frequency. Now, you understand, again, this is just a shotgun approach. This is not a full listing of all the passages from Psalms that are applied to the life of Jesus. But for example, when Jesus enters the triumphal entry in Matthew 21, in verse nine, the crowd shouts Hosanna, to the son of David, and then they say, blessing is he who comes in the name of the Lord. Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord, a quote from Psalm 118 And verse 26. And Jesus used the Psalms to teach people who he was turned over to Matthew 22, please, this is a very critical passage. Matthew 22, beginning with verse 41. Again, if you have a question, you can feel free to ask it right now. But Matthew 22, verse 41, Jesus has been asked a series of questions by the Sadducees by the Pharisees but other groups. In verse 41, while the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked the OMA question What do you think about the Christ? Whose son Izzy? And they said, the hill, the son of David, he said to them, then how does David in the spirit, call him Lord, say, The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit at my right hand, until I make your enemies until I put your enemies beneath your feet. If David then calls him, Lord, how is he his son? No one was able to answer him a question, nor did anyone dare from that day on, ask him. Another question. There's a passage that Jesus is quoting from in verse 44, verse 43, and 44 is Psalm 110. Psalm 110, particularly Psalm one In 10, verse one, the Lord said to my Lord, Sit at my right hand until I put your enemies beneath your feet. Jesus said, David wrote this, and David said this in the Spirit. Now, David was key. As key. You were at the top of the ladder.

Unknown Speaker  20:35
There's no one any higher than you. And he said, Who is the Messiah? They said, He's the sort of David, questions not? That answer is not incorrect. All through the Old Testament. The Old Testament talks about the Messiah, as the son of David, in the New Testament. There are many references to Jesus being the Son of David, in that question, that answer is not

Unknown Speaker  21:10
incorrect. But it's incomplete. If he's just David's, son, how does David call him lowered? Jesus uses that one verse from Psalms to drive home a truth about who here is? The Messiah is the son of David. But the Messiah is also David's Lord, He is God. The deity and humanity of Jesus, are both tied up in that answer. Now there's I was looking at this PowerPoint. Last night right after I saw it, it recognized it there was a great omission that I made if something that we do include and it comes at this point.

Unknown Speaker  22:39
Turn your Bibles to John 13. John 13, is John's account of the last night of Jesus before the crucifixion of his address as he speaks to His disciples. And John 13, records Jesus, washing the disciples feet. But I particularly for our purposes this morning, and we're seeing how the Psalms inform us about Jesus. Look at verse 18. Psalm, John 13, verse 18, I do not speak to all of you. I know the one I have chosen, but it is it the Scripture may be fulfilled. He who eats my bread has lifted his heel against me. Now that is a quotation and you probably have a good cross reference in your Bible. Or maybe a note that you have written that Psalm 41, verse nine, Psalm 41, verse nine, He who has eaten my bread, has lifted his heel against me. In the anxious Near East, it was a serious, serious thing to have someone in your home to eat. As you had someone in your house to eat, the host was saying to the gas, that I will provide for you and I will do you no harm. And the guest was also agreed that he would do no harm to the host it was almost understood contract between the host and the guest that they would both seek for the best in the other and yet Jesus is going to be betrayed. Jesus is going to be betrayed by one who has eaten his bread, one who is partaking of his hospitality. One who has shared his food, he is going to lift his heel against him as a horse as an untrained horse and kick. If you read Psalm 41 in context, I know that I can say this quite confidently with no fear of rebuttal. I know Psalm 41, is not exclusively about Jesus. You know how I know that? Because in Psalm 41, verse four, the author says these words, Psalm 41, verse four, as for me, oh, Lord, be gracious to me. Heal my soul, for I have sinned against you. With Jesus have said those words. Psalm 41, is not exclusively about Jesus. Psalm 41, is headed as psalm of David, I think there are reasons to take those headings seriously. And I think David is talking about his own experiences. When he talks about his close friend who has eaten his bread has lifted his heel against me, and I think we probably have a pretty good idea who Jesus close friend that had eaten his bread who'd lifted his heel against him who that probably was. Do you remember the story of a HIPAA fail? And how a HIPAA fail was a trusted counselor of David, a trusted adviser of David. And you remember when David heard that a HIPAA fail had defected to Absalom in Second Samuel 15. He said, Oh, Lord, confound the counsel of Ahithophel you remember that story? And you remember after a hit of fail, realizes that his advice wasn't taken.

Unknown Speaker  27:39
And that this was this rebellion was doomed to defeat you remember when he did he set his house in order in Second Samuel 1723 And he strangled himself he hung himself

Unknown Speaker  27:58
sounds like Judas does it but I will tell you something else about his fail

Unknown Speaker  28:12
here's the fail had a son. This is mentioned in Second Samuel 2334 He had a son named

Unknown Speaker  28:21
Eli um does that name ring a bell with any of you?

Unknown Speaker  28:32
A lie I am. had a daughter who was named Bathsheba. I think there's good reason to assume that a here's a fail. Was Bathsheba his grandfather? David said, My close friend who has eaten my bread has lifted his heel against me. Had David done anything in this circumstance that he could bear blame for? Yeah, it may be. It may be that Isabel should never bail. It may be that he had to fill it in faithless Lee. But at the same time, David had done something to incur his anger. Jesus had done nothing. That could be blamed for what Judas did. My point If we like a hit or fail, we can relate. If we like David can relate to the stain of betrayal, if we've done the right thing, and we have befriended someone who needed us, and yet that person turned against us,

Unknown Speaker  30:24
is stabbed us in Dubai. If you can relate to that at all, maybe you can on some level. I want you to know that Jesus can relate to those experiences to

Unknown Speaker  30:45
for Jesus had that happened to him, and he had worse happened to him. From the standpoint that Jesus had not done anything, anything that deserved the kind of treatment he received. And yet, Jesus experienced this kind of betrayal, I have more here than I can state. And you all are free to send these PowerPoints out to everyone that would like them. If you want to see further my notes, but let me invite you to turn to John 19. See if I can explain this quickly before it's time to close. I do appreciate your patience and bearing with me this morning. John 19, you remember it verse 31, they will need to bring the body of Jesus down from the cross because the next day was a feast day. And they went to the legs of the criminals on both sides of Jesus and broke their legs. And they come to Jesus and they find that he's dead already. They put in a sword and outcomes water and blood. They do not break his legs because he's already dead. And it says it fulfills a scripture that not a bone of heal will be broken. That's verse 36. John 19, verse 36, fulfills the Scripture not about to be broken. Now. I think they're really a couple of ideas that are being fulfilled in this. This is a fulfillment of the Passover lamb imagery. The Passover lamb not a bone was broken in Exodus 12 Verse 46, in numbers nine, verse 12, not a bowl was broken. And Jesus is the Passover Lamb, the ultimate Passover lamb pointed to buy all the previous pass overs. But also say this, that I also think there's another image possible, possibly been invoked in my Bible has footnotes, not only to those passages in Exodus in numbers of the Passover lamb, but it also has a reference to Psalm 34 And verse 20, Psalm 34, in verse 20, which tells us that he keeps all his bones, not one of them is broken. In the book of Psalms, there is a righteous suffer one who does right, but he suffers for it. Nonetheless, in this picture, Jesus the feels Jesus is the ultimate righteous suffer. He's the ultimate innocent suffer all innocent sufferers before him, ultimately point to him. But if you look at Psalm 34, I think I can make this point very quickly. Psalm 34, is a psalm that talks about the righteous having many troubles, but the Lord delivering them up from all look at Psalm 34, four, I sought the Lord and he answered me and He delivered me from all my fears, he has troubles but the Lord delivered him. Verse six, this poor man cried to the Lord and the Lord heard him and saved him out of all his troubles. In verse 17, the righteous cry and the Lord hears and delivers him out of all their troubles. And then in verse 19, Many are the afflictions of the righteous, but the Lord delivers them from them. All. These passages show us that the righteous will have many troubles in life, but the Lord will deliver them. But interesting, that passages quoted, when Jesus has just died on the crawls. Did that save why deliverance? Did that seem like God rescued him out of all his troubles? I would say what Jesus death and resurrection shows us Is it these promises are valid? Even if you have troubles in your life, a new never experience of deliverance in this life the death and resurrection of Jesus show us that we will be delivered in the resurrection. He expands the meaning of the Psalms. You all are patient, patient and kind and I appreciate your attention. Thank you
