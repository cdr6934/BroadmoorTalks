But it was good to see each one of you tonight, if you're visiting with us online. And we appreciate so much, you also being part of our study that I would like for us to begin by looking at Hebrews, the first chapter, verse one and two. So I'll have all the passages on the screen. And I always do think it's helpful to look in your own Bible, because you get to see the fuller picture sometimes, than what I have on the screen. The Hebrew writer, whoever that may have been, wrote these words to begin his letter. He said long ago, many times in many ways God spoke to our fathers by the prophets. But in these last day, he has spoken to us by a son, whom we have put it, the air of all things through whom he also created the world as a wonderful opening statement, and it became a contrast to periods of times. The contrast is some things that took place in times past. compare those to the time that the author was writing the now those in the last days when he was writing. He says, First that in the past, that God spoke to the fathers, fathers were the Jewish fathers, their ancestors, the patriarchs, but more than just the patriarchs, all the people who had lived in the old times previously, of the Jewish raise. These were the fathers that were he was referring to. And he says that, there's two things about that specifies that speech, he said first, that is that the gods spoke at many times. And also they spoke it in many ways. Note the word many. And think of just a lot, a lot of times a lot of ways. Almost we could think of almost constant continuous speaking, a guide did to the Father's, to the ancestors. And when we think of the term many times we think of, you know, a particular point in time you spoke here and a particular point in time you spoke there silver, we break it up into periods of time, because that's what the words suggest to us. But there are those who say that it should be translated like the American Standard Version says, by divers portions. And that gives a different picture. There it says it was given part here and part they're here apart in their part. And that gives us the thought, was some referred to as progressive revelation. The term progressive revelations used to suggest that the speaking of God, the revealing that that God made of himself, and of His will, occurred over time, and it progressed, the things he said later built upon the things he has said earlier, he did not tell us everything. Early on, he told us those things that he wanted us to know, at a particular point in time. But then later, he gave another part to his revelation, and then another, and they kind of build upon one another. So So I think least as suggested by the term divers portions, but also in many ways, and you can think probably many ways that the Lord spoke, sometimes you didn't a dream sometimes envision sometimes mouth of a donkey, sometimes in a burning bush. The Lord spoke in many different ways, in these times past. He contrasts that though with these last days, where he says God has spoken to us, to us, the generation of the author and those who have that day in time, he has God did not contain himself just to speak in times past. But God also felt it necessary to speak to them as well. And so the author claims that God has spoken to them. That's a strong claim, isn't it? In times past, he spoke by the prophets and you can name many prophets of Abraham's name, the first prize, the first one to be called a prophet in the Old Testament text. Abel is a was a prophet according to the New Testament text.

Curtis Byers  04:22
But there were all a lot of prophets throughout times. I still remember the definition of Prophet that brother Haley, gave him a freshman Bible class I took a long, long time ago, it was his last semester teaching at Florida College, and had the privilege of studying Old Testament history with you. He referred to this passage if my memory serves me correctly, here's where I learned it. He referred to this passion as an extra seven, one to two as an illustration of a profit. I've always looked and remembered it and thought is very helpful. You remember the context. God has appeared to Moses and is asked Moses to go to Pharaoh, and Moses gives excuses. So one of his excuses that he doesn't have the ability to talk. He doesn't have the ability to, to speak well. And so God solves a problem by saying that, that, that Eric, his brother could speak for him. So in this passage, Nexus seven says, The Lord said to Moses, See, I've made you like God to Pharaoh, and your brother Aaron shall be your prophet. For usual speak all that I command, you and your brother in Arizona, tell Pharaoh to let the people visual gold out of this layer. Moses is a prophet of God. But Eric is going to be Moses, his prophet. A prophet is simply a mouthpiece, a spokesman, one who says the things that they are told to say, by God or by Moses, in this case. So a mouthpiece and I think that illustrates a pretty well, a prophetess will be a mouthpiece. But God spoke through these mouthpieces, these these men and women that he had in Old Testament times. But now that the text goes on to say that now in these last days, he spoke to us, he spoke to us by his Son, by son. A son has a lot higher rank than a prophet, a prophet, just a mouthpiece, but now God has spoken to us by his Son, by son. And I think John lawn and opening verse of the Gospel of John is very helpful in illustrating this. There, John Opus, his gospel was in the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. Is that a great picture? Jesus is called the word. What is a word? A word is a means by which we communicate is how we communicate an idea how we communicate thought, he put up, we put our thoughts into words, and we give those words to someone else to communicate that thought. But Jesus, John tells us is the word, the word. And the Word was God. He's the Son of God, He was God. And He was with God. Is that a grand picture of Jesus is the Word. The main point of this passage, though, is, however, it whenever God spoke, think about that. Think about the opposite. What if God never spoke? What if God created us, but they never talked to us? What if he never let us know about him being there? Let us know about what he has done for us. What if we didn't know the promises of God? What are the what if we didn't know his plans? Can you imagine that world? I can't hardly I can't imagine that. But thankfully, thankfully, God spoke and he continued to speak. I think there's also a kind of there seems to kind of a note of finality there. We say he's spoken to us by his Son. Right, there's a Graz and time has passed, there were many prophets. And it was done in diverse parts. But there's kind of the application in the past. He doesn't say explicitly, but implicitly, he kind of says this mean, that there's a finality now, with the speaking through his son, he has said his son, there's nothing else to be said. He's spoken to us through His Son. There's a corollary truth to the Bible. Yes, God has spoken. But as a corollary truth, that's what I want to talk about tonight is how do we know what God has said? How do you and I know what God has spoken? He does not speak to us personally. There are people who claim that I did not plead SDKs did not how do we know? Well, we know because we have the Bible. So really, I want to do tonight is just talk about the Bible.

Curtis Byers  09:05
And I think that I'm just gonna look at a few passages, nothing that I've not ever said. But if things I've said before, I'm sure many times the different ways in this in this auditorium, and lessons you have heard forever. But I really believe that the passages that we're going to look at are very vital passages, important passages that we should know and understand. If we're in large part, I really had the young people in this audience, who may be those who might be watching in mind as I was thinking about this lesson and preparing for it. You need to understand the truthfulness of that I think of what we're going to read in these in these passages. So I'm going to try to be as plain as clear as I can be, because I also learned that Paris and older people need clarity to usually I've always thought that if I could get an older person understand I have no problem getting a younger person understand. That's the way I think about it. And it seems to be have proven prove true through the years. So if you're younger, if you would like me to listen if you can, and pay attention and think about these paths, and remember these pastors, there's only a few of them. So Hebrews one is the first passage or likely to remember, Hebrews one, first couple of verses. And remember John one to throw that one in there too. Next measure was look at those his old fan already Ephesians chapter three, this is one of my favorite passages, but I think about the Bible. Let's read verses the first seven verses Ephesians chapter three. For this reason, I, Paul, a prisoner of Jesus Christ on behalf of the Gentiles, assuming that you have heard of their stewardship of God's grace that was given to me for you how the mystery was made known to me by revelation, as I have written briefly, when you read this, you can perceive my insight into the mystery of Christ, which was not made known to the sons of man and other generations has now been revealed by his holy apostles and prophets by the Spirit. This mystery is that the Gentiles are filled errors, members of the same body, and partakers of the promise. In Christ Jesus through the gospel of this gospel, I was made a minister according to the gift of God's grace, which was given to me by the working of his power. Let's look at this passage. It first starts off by talking about a mystery. And he defines the mystery for us. The mystery or the is that the Gentiles are fellow fellow errors. We understand that the Jewish people were the heirs of the promise. When God chose Abraham and his seed, and gave unto him the promise, God made a division in mankind. There were those who were part of that seed promise, part of that great nation promise, that land promise and there were those who are outside that promise. As we go through the Old Testament, that's what we that's what we see a division between the Jews and the Gentiles. But Paul is here saying, yes, there is a mystery that has now been revealed. We did not know this in old times, we now know it is that the Gentiles are fellow heirs, heirs of that same promise, the dividing line has been wiped out between Jew and Gentile. So that's the that's the main point. But that's not the part I would really want to emphasize. What I'm interested in, is that Paul says that this mystery was made known to him by revelation was a revelation. The word basically means that I'm covering and uncovering, think of something that's on a table that has got a cloth over it. And then when you look at you're trying to guess what it is, but you can't guess but then when you take the cloth off, you uncover it, you reveal what is under the cloth. Right? That's it revelation has been covered, but now has been uncovered. And Paul says he's been told he's been, he's been revealed to him. What this mystery was the mystery of the Gentiles being fill errors. And why was Paul selected? Well, we're gonna find out here in a minute, well, he's got to be an apostle. So that's the primary reason. But the passage should be also says that he is by the grace of God, God through His grace selected, Paul. Okay. How to how to how to God reveal himself? How did God reveal his mystery to Paul, we're not told, but there wasn't a dream or a vision or face to face or, you know, through some other means, we're not told. But he, Paul makes it clear that he had received this revelation. And Paul, it goes on to say that this was not made known in other generations. That's why it was a mystery, because it was not made known, but has now to reveal by his holy apostles and prophets, by the Spirit.

Curtis Byers  14:00
What do you notice there's that same contrast, right? And other generations and times past. And now, the same difference that we saw there in Hebrews one is reflected in Paul's writings here too. There was a difference between what had took place in other generations and what's being revealed now this generation, right, as has been revealed by his holy apostles and prophets by the spirits. A word holy is important. It simply means set apart. Remember that? We often think it means something has something to say about our character, we thought about personally and holy, and we think of some some good person. Well, holy person should be good. But that's not the idea of holy if they're good, and let's just say they're good that that expresses that ideal. The ideal holy means that they have been set apart they have been selected and set apart for a purpose for a task is the same word that was also translated saints. We are Saints, we are set apart. Now we are set apart for a purpose and we are set apart for good works. And we are set apart to do well to do good things. But the word itself doesn't describe our character. It describes who we are, and that we've been set apart. The apostles and the prophets have been set apart by God. It was God who decided who the apostles would be and who the prophets would be a person who just couldn't come along and say, I'm apostle, God, speak to me, speak to me, and I'll be, I'll be your apostle, or I'll be your Prophet doesn't work that way. God shows God is the one who set apart the apostles and prophets that we send to wisdom, we say that God has spoken to his son. So how do the apostles and prophets still fit in? Well remember Jesus in a great commission, when Jesus before he left the earth, he first while in John, in the Gospel of John Chapter 14, through 17, he has a lot of things to said that they're gonna happen, he's gonna send the Comforter to them, and so forth and so on. But in the Great Commission, he's he tells him to go there to go forth and teach all the things that He has commanded them. Right. The word apostle simply means a messenger. The word apostle means a messenger. These are messengers who have been set apart who have been chosen by God and chosen by Jesus, to give a message to give a revealing, right, so they've been set apart of holy apostles and the prophets. And also then it says, by the Spirit, by the Spirit. We're gonna read more about the spirit in our Solera text we're gonna look at in a moment, but let me just simply make the point at this point, that throughout both the Old and New Testament, the spirit was the one who has who empowered people, for the for their given task. He empowered people for their given task. Sometimes he gave them powers to do miracles like Moses, and the plagues and all other great mode, Mira was a Muslim, so but most of the time, and most of the generations and most occurrences, it was a spirit, who did the giving the word to the Prophet, to reveal God's mind, he was the one who revealed the mind of God to the to the, to this prophet to the apostles. That's what it says, He has been revealed by the Spirit, the Spirit was the one who searched the mind of God, who revealed those things to the people, some people referred to as a spirit of prophecy. And I think that's probably a good way to think of it because prophecy was by far and away the most common empowerment that the Spirit did. He gave His Word, the Word of God to people. So they can speak forth God's word, right? So we see all this, the sun, the apostles, the prophets, and the spirit all work together, to proclaim the message of God, proclaim God's message.

Curtis Byers  18:11
Now, there are three claims. And there are implicit what Paul says here. And I want to, I guess, in the face of the passage first, Paul, then goes on to say that earlier he said, that, concerning this mystery, he has written briefly so that when you read this, you can perceive my insight into the mystery of Christ, Paul's that he wrote down the things that he was being revealed to him, he wrote them down, so they could perceive his insight to the mystery of Christ. Okay. Now, there are three things that are implicit claims that Paul makes. I want to look at those explicitly. First, Paul claims to have correctly understood God's revelation. Isn't that implicit in what Paul's saying? That God that Paul has correctly understood this revelation? When it was uncovered to Paul, Paul understood exactly what God wanted him to understand. The second claim is that his writings accurately convey God's revelation that his his writings are accurate. They give the correct meaning and the correct words, correct whatever sins of what God had revealed. And then thirdly, the defeat Ephesians are able to correctly understand Paul's writings. I think those are three powerful claims, three powerful claims, and they're very important claims, because not everybody agrees with those. Not everybody thinks those are true. I can't tell you many times I've read things where people were writing along and they say, Well, Paul must been mistaken about that. Or Paul was somehow wrong about that. Or, you know, Paul was limited by his place in time, and you know if he lived nowadays he wouldn't say the same thing. They don't believe that Paul had a correct understanding. That's not Paul's view, though, is it? That's an important point. Forget what they say. Paul's view was that he had a correct understanding of God's revelation. He understood correctly, what God had wanting him to know. And of course, there are a lot of people these days who say, well, we can't understand what God wants us know, we can understand it's too complex, it's too too difficult. And they would point to the fact that there's a bunch of different understandings on any given point, you can find a multiplicity of understandings that people have. And that just gives them proof that while the God's word must be too difficult, again, that's not Paul's view isn't. Paul's view was that when they read what he wrote, they could understand what he understood about the mystery that was revealed to him. In other words, this these claims means that the Ephesians knowledge should be exactly the same as Paul's knowledge, which should be the same as God's revelation. You see that? Those are powerful claims. And I'd rather trust Paul, then trust those who say Paul was in error. Right? I trust Paul. next passage over First Thessalonians, the second chapter, verse 13, First Thessalonians, two verse 13. There Paul rise. And we also thank God constantly for this, that when you receive the Word of God, which you heard from us, you accepted it not as the word of men, but as what it really is the word of God, which does work to you and believers. You notice that the Thessalonians were to be commended. Because when they heard Paul speak, they said, Paul, we hear you, we understand that those are your words, but we understand that they're not really your words. Those words are God's words. And so they accepted Paul's words as being the words of God. That's exactly what Paul has said over Ephesians, right. His words are God's words, and they should be accepted as such. Now, why did the Thessalonians do that? Do they just think Paul was impressive? Do they just think Well, Paul claims to be a spokesman a gospel? That must be true, so we're just gonna accept it? Is that what they? Is that what they did? Well, no, if you go back to the first chapter of First Thessalonians, what Paul is writing down, he says, verse five, because our gospel came to you, not in word only, but also in power, and in the Holy Spirit, and with full conviction.

Curtis Byers  22:57
I always thought this is interesting, because a couple of things. If you go back to the book of Acts, go back to Acts chapter 17. I believe it is where we read where Paul, first visit Thessalonica. And we read about Paul going to the synagogue, and so forth, and so on. But we do not read a Paul performing miracles there in Acts 17. Luke does not tell us anything about Paul performing the miracles, that clearly is what this passage refers to, doesn't it. But it says that, not only in Word, but also in power, power is the is kind of the substitute word that you often see for, for the miraculous gifts, but also in power, and in the Holy Spirit, with full conviction, right? The Holy Spirit of power Paul to do the task that he needed to do, and that included not only is giving him the words to say, but given him the powers the miracles to be able to demonstrate that God was speaking through him. And that's why we accept what Paul says. Right? Because we have the we have the written records, that tell us of the things that he did in the miracles that He did in the miracles that Jesus did in the miracles that Moses did reason we accept those things, because we read about them and we can see the miracles and read over and over. And we exist I accept those as true. Right? So I accept Paul's words as God's words, because Paul was an apostle who empowered by the Spirit of God for that particular task. So, the spirit is important, not only given the words but also in, in confirming the word we soften this you say it like that, he confirmed the word to the things that he empowered the people to do. Make sense? Okay. Let's go to Second Timothy, the third chapter, another very, very favorite passage of mine. Verse 14 says, But as for you continue what you have learned and have firmly believed knowing from whom you have learned it, and how from childhood You have been acquainted with sacred writings, which are able to make you wise for salvation through faith in Christ Jesus. All Scripture is breathed out by God and available for pre for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for training and righteousness. That the man of God may be complete, equipped for every good work. We often just focus on those last two verses, but those first couple of verses are also very important. Verses 14 through 16 or 15. Rather, he tells Timothy to continue in what you have learned and have firmly believed. What is that. But just go back a few verses, Paul commends Timothy, For accepting the following in the teaching of Paul, right. He's talking about the things here that Paul has taught, in fact, I think was goes on to say, knowing from whom you have learned it. He's talking about Paul, continue to things that you've learned and bleed because you know who you learned those from you learn those for me, and I'm an apostle of Jesus Christ. So you continue in those things that I have taught you. And not only just not only that, not only have you learned from me, but you also have known the Scriptures. He says, the holy writings he had been acquainted with from childhood who taught him that was mother and grandmother taught him those writings as a child. And they also speak of God's plans and of God's will and God's desire and promises. Right. So those two things together should be enough this convinced Timothy to continue in those things, in which he had already learned and had already firmly believed. Okay? Now, he calls these the sacred writings. A lot of translations say Holy Scriptures, is the same words, sacred Holy are often translated the same of our trans to different translations, the same word. And the term scripture simply means writings. But we call them scriptures because they're not just like other writings, they are holy writings. Just like the men, apostles and prophets are holy, who have been set apart. Both the writings of those prophets and apostles are also holy. They have been set apart, they're different than other writings. They're different than the writings of men. Right? These are special writing their sacred writings, right? And then we come to verse 16. Where it says all scripture is breathed out by God. I love this translation. The King James Version said, All scripture is given by inspiration of God. And many modern translations they all scripture is inspired of God. Okay, but that word, and I can't pronounce it.

Curtis Byers  27:58
You can see the root words there though, Theo, which means God. And that new stows was, I don't think pronounce that ways. Maybe close enough means breath. Okay means breath. So they are breathed out back to the scriptures are breathed out by God. Right? Breath has two parts, right? There's an inhaling and there's an exhaling, you have to breathe in. And then you breathe out. The breathing in you could call an inspiration and inspiring. But the breathing out would be called an exploration of breathing now as an exploration. So to use the word inspired or inspiration gives the wrong picture. Right? It tells like a breathing in something. That's not what the passage is for referring to. Scripture is breathed out by God. Right? Scripture is breathed out by God. So I just don't care if that word inspiration being used in this context, because it gives a wrong sense. Right gives the wrong sense. As I love the translation, where it's simply translates translates literally, All scripture is breathed out by God, there's not a point there to be known to us, you're probably already ahead of me. The word Pneuma is a word for spirit that new stoves that you see there, the second part of that word is the same word. There's also translated spirit. You know, so you could say, an A says, that the, that the spirit is the breath of God, the Spirit is the breath of God. You know, and there are a lot of Anthro morphisms attributed to God, the arm of the Lord, the hand of the Lord the finger, the Lord, you know, with the breath of the Lord can be thought of as as a spirit. And why is that appropriate? Was that appropriate image? Because in God's breath that he breathes out scripture is the Spirit who takes those words and gives them to the prophet or to the apostle, is the Spirit who conveys those to the apostles were the prophets. Right? So as soon as a great picture, All scripture is breathed out by God. Now look at, look at the what we've learned, okay? God spoke to me and that he selected the women that he selected that he chose holy men, prophets, who turned around and wrote down and put in writing that word. Now Paul says, that whole process he calls is God breathed. That whole process, the great picture, isn't it, God breathed and what came out scripture. Right, Scripture came out, the written word came out. Now it had to go through a process, it had to go through this chain to from the Spirit, to the person to the pen and ink to the to the document, there's a process there, but God, but he used that word God breathed to refer to that entire process. Right. And that's the image we should hold on to. Now, theologians though, like to do things sometimes for good and sometimes not. So good. Theologians have come along, and they have divided this single process up into two processes. The first one they call Revelation, the second one, they call it inspiration. Don't having I don't have any problems ideal breaking up this two parts, I kind of, I've kind of shown it in two parts. So there's two logical parts here, you got to you got to reveal to the man and then you have to write it that is kind of two parts. I don't have a problem with that, per se. That's really not having a problem with calling the first part revelation. Because that's a term Paul uses as a term Scripture uses to refer to God making known his wheel to me. Right, but problem is the second part. First of all, I already tell you, I like the word inspiration, because it gives wrong ideal because it has a breathing in, right? It's kind of like, God breathed into the scriptures, or something like that. Now, let me see what Salacia what men have done with this. First, think about the liberal Christian, that Christians and kosher these are people who claim to be Christians, I'm not here to judge that the people who claim to be Christians believe there's a whole spectrum of people out there who claim to be Christians, some are more conservative than others. Some are more liberal. on the liberal side of the spectrum. There are many, many people who claim to be Christians, who will say that there's no such thing as revelation that God doesn't speak to me. And that just doesn't happen. And God doesn't empower people to do miracles by a spirit either. Those things just don't happen. There's no such thing as Revelation.

Curtis Byers  32:35
And when it comes to inspiration, they say, oh, yeah, sure. That's okay. They like that. But they mean it. It says like insight, like a Shakespeare had insight. And he could he can convey truths, and elegant way. Well, that's the way they say these prophets were these prophets had insights into God. I don't know how they got the insight. But somehow they had these insights. And they've shared with us their human insights. That's what they mean by revenue by inspiration. Right? And it inspiring, inspiring message. So you started getting ready to start getting the wrong idea. But that word is inspiration, word itself kind of lizard, lizard Leazes, down that path. And their way of thinking is not the right path to go down. Now, the conservative Christian will say, yes, there's revelation, I believe in Revelation, that God truly does speak to men and women, his prophets and apostles, they would agree with that. When it comes to inspiration, they give a special definition to this. I want to share you share this with you. Now, this is just one writer. This is Jack Cotterell. So you may know him. He's a he's a member of the conservative Christian church. He's a scholar. He's a professor, I think somewhere I'm not sure exactly where he's written a bunch of books. Some of them are good and not someone rod is good, I don't think but anyway, he's, he's considered a conservative, evangelical scholar. And his definition is a very common definition used by conservative theologians. evangelicals. Inspiration is the term used to refer to those special supranational supervision exercised by God over his messengers, to make sure they communicate his message accurately. Because of it. We know when we are reading the Bible, we are reading the Word of God. Now what is inspiration to him? Is this supernatural is this miraculous process, a supernatural process? Where God guarantees that the that the Prophet apostle didn't write down anything wrong, that he kept the apostle prophet from writing anything down wrong. That's what he means by inspiration. And that's why it came from a lot of conservative evangelicals Mima inspiration as the superintendence by God to guard the hand as he was writing, to make sure that he did not write anything that was wrong, that he accurately conveyed what he was told. Right. Now, first of all, that may be true, I'm not here to do the truthfulness of that statement, right? But any statement that we make about scripture, how are how can we how can we justified, we got to justify, we can find passages that convey that or teach that. So if this is if this was one person believes took place, then they ought to be able to come forward with passages to show that this is true. Okay. And maybe they can, but my dilemma is this, most the time, they'll go to Second Timothy three, to prove this point. Because after all, the word inspiration, the King James only use twice, once to book a job. It wasn't in Second Timothy. So it's not the word itself is not found very often. And so they go to Second Timothy three and say that this is being taught in Second Timothy three. I'm sorry, I just don't see that being taught in Second Timothy three, it may be taught somewhere else. And so that's fine. But just That's not what's being said. And second Timothy three, right? The breath of God, they is the only SPIRATION being talked about the expiration, right? The breath of God, outcome Scripture, the process is not under consideration. The result is what's under consideration. Once God has breathed has gone through a process. And here's the result. It doesn't tell us what God did or not, did not do all along the way. That's just not told to us. They're in Second Timothy three. We know that part of the process that God reveal himself to people like Paul, right. So I just, I would prefer going back to this picture. I would prefer it at a minimum, we just do away with the word inspiration there. And just if you want to argue for this, this is fine. That's that's a biblical, I can argue that from Scripture. And just stop there. Right? I don't know if I have a need to go much further. Okay. Does that mean does that make sense? Does that if you have any questions about that, please, I hope I was hoping to be clear, may have lost some people with that and dumped me to be confusing. By I'm trying to just make the point that we need to be careful when we try to simplify things that we don't add words that could maybe make it muddy or that we were really believe it is or least muddier than what the text is. We stay with the text we're gonna be will be safe. If we stay with the text, we're safe.

Curtis Byers  37:17
So but there's a reason why scripture is God, God Bree why God is breathed out scripture is because it is profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for training in righteousness, that man of God may be complete, equipped for every good work. Right? There's a reason God has given us scripture is to give us the information we need for reproving, for correcting ourselves, for knowing what is right, and how we can train ourselves to discipline ourselves in righteousness. And how we can be complete, equipped for every good work. That's what Scriptures do for us. And that's why it's important for us to learn scripture, young people. That's why it's important to memorize scripture, why we need to study it. Because it is good for us. It's necessary for us, just like food is necessary for the physical body. God's word is was necessary for our spiritual growth and spiritual bodies. We needed and we can't live without it. Makes sense? Because not a good picture for us over a second Peter, I want to bring to your attention to Second Peter first chapter. So we've looked at Hebrews one, we looked at fusions three, we looked at Second Thessalonians five was five, wasn't it? And we looked at Second Timothy three now we're gonna look at Second Peter one. And we had the prophetic word made fully confirmed to wish you will do do well to pay attention as a lamp shining in a dark place, until the day dawns and the morning star star rises in our heart, knowing this, first of all, that no prophecy of Scripture comes from someone's own interpretation. For no prophecy was ever produced by the will of man. But men spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit. Right knows that. First of all, no prophecy of Scripture comes from someone's own interpretation. That that that's a little bit awkward. That's that that translation is always a little bit awkward to me, I think is I think it means exactly what this next verse goes on to say that no prophecy was ever produced by the will of man. That's what I think it means. In other words, again, a person could just stand up and say, Hey, I've got I've got a word of the Lord for you. Let me tell you what God's said, we can't do that. Right, because unless God has told us, that's not our place. And so no scripture ever came by a private giving of the word about private prophecy that does not how prophecy combs does not come by the will of man. What a man decides to do, but again, it's left up to God. It's been men spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit. Now that word carried along as an interesting word, I don't have the Greek term up here, I wouldn't know anyway if I saw it. But I'm told that that word is the same word that would be used, like a boat would be carried along by the wind, you know, a sailboat, the wind blows, the wind moves, the boat across the surface of the waters, is carried along. But here you see the picture, a gospel, the men have spoke from God as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit. Right? Again, that word spirit, which we say could be translated breath. The same word is also translated wind in Scripture. So again, we had this picture. Now, the spirit is not the breath of God, the Spirit is the wind of God. And the wind is moving people to speak God's word. Right? They're carried along, they're being moved by the Spirit, to speak God's word. How are they able to speak those words because of spirit gave them the things to say that did the spirits of how to pronounce did overs oversee that perhaps, like that would be consistent with this, but it's not it's not necessarily right. Not not implied in this. But anyway, that's not the main point. My main point is, again, is that these are people, these are prophets. These are apostles, who have been given what to say. And they've been empowered by the Spirit to speak those words. So they are people we should give attention to. Right? But apostle speaks, we ought to listen. Right? When a prophet speaks, we listened. And what and all the words of profits in his in profit parcels that we have is to be found in the scriptures, there's no place else we can find them. There's no place else we can find them. And one last passage,

Curtis Byers  42:02
or a second Peter 314, through 16. Therefore, beloved, says you are waiting for these Be diligent to be found by hand without spot or blemish, and fps, and count the patient of Our Lord of salvation. Just as our beloved brother Paul also wrote to you according to the wisdom given him, as he does at all his letters, when he speaks in these matters, there are some things that are hard to understand was the ignorant and stable, twisted old destruction as they do other scriptures? Well, it's this, Paul, Peter says, are some things that Paul wrote that are hard to understand that does that contradict the point I made earlier, where I said that Paul was claiming that his writings were understandable that Ephesians could understand the things that he has written. I don't think they're in conflict. They may be in tension. There may be something you got to think about there for a moment. But they're not a conflict. It doesn't say that they're Peter does not say that they're impossible to understand, does he? He doesn't say they're impossible. Just he says they're hard to understand. They can still be understood. But they're hard are things hard to understand. Well, things can be hard to understand for different reasons. If someone was writing in a different language that I'm that I'm familiar with, that would be hard for me to understand, we're not gonna need Somebody to translate it for me. Maybe they're using a vocabulary that I'm not used to, that might make it hard. Maybe they're using concepts that I'm not familiar with, that I've not heard used before, that might make it hard. Maybe what they're saying goes counter to what I have previously understood. Right? And therefore I'm confused. It's hard for me to understand them, because it doesn't go along with what I've already used to do in the past. And that may be why I don't know of all those that I just gave that maybe the reason why Paul is right is harder to stand. If you were a Jewish person, and you had a certain view of what God had done in the past, and now you're told about this mystery in the Gentiles being brought in? That would be hard, perhaps for you to understand. Is it impossible? No is not impossible. It's just a hard message to accept, because it's different than what you have previously understood. So we need to check our baggage at the door, right? When we come to hear God's word. We need to try to put away our previous understandings that would keep us from hearing what God is saying to us. That's not to say that we should throw away our previous I'm not saying that because hopefully, most if not all, of what we've understood in the past are also true. Hopefully, we've had good teachers and we've we've been good students. But we need to be Be aware that if we read something in Scripture that seems to be in conflict with what we have previously understood. We don't automatically and assuming that Scripture is wrong, or that that can't be what God meant. We need to go back and say what am I really right about what I have understood previously, that may be what we need to do. Right? So, second Peter three, I think it's a passage we ought to throw in this mix, as well. And because those things aren't hard to understand, or sometimes people would make things out to be hard, because they say that went to the core to Peter, they want to twist the scriptures to bring others to destruction, and they'll do so along with themselves. It's kind of heresy also, he says, as they do their scriptures. What does that imply? Peter is talking about the writings of Paul, they're going to twist Paul's writings as they do the other scriptures. What was Peter's view of Paul's writings? They were scripture to him. He knew that those were holy writings, because he was a holy apostle. And so the writings that were, those were words that were given to him by God to speak. So those were scriptures, according to Peter, or Paul I written and so therefore, they will understand. I hope I mean, I'm time's up. Hope that the probably passed on sorry, forgot long I was gonna go short tonight. But I hope these passages have been meaningful to you, and maybe a little bit more meaningful to you. And I would encourage you to think about and continue to think about, and to appreciate what we have. God has spoken to us through His son, and his son has given us His Word, through himself, and through his holy apostles and prophets, by the Spirit, were the recipients of all of that effort. And we want to take advantage of it and learn what God has said, and so that we might do it and be the profitable service that God would have us to be. If there's any here tonight who know what God expects of you, and you want to respond to God's invitation, the invitation that given to us by the Lord, we would encourage you to do that. As we stand and sing this song has been announced.
