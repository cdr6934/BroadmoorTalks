Good morning to everyone here. Good to see you. I know there are several online as well, we're glad that you're here. I appreciate very much everyone's attention to try to put God first and put spiritual matters as a matter of priority. So I'm so glad that I'm able to worship with you this morning. In 539, Cyrus the Great combined forces with the Medes. And he started one of the greatest empires that it existed at that time, at least they they tackled the most land. And so, Cyrus defeated the Babylonians, which ended about 150 year reign of the Babylonians and they had in turn defeated the Assyrians. Now, these were the start of world powers. World dominating powers, the Assyrians, in fact, defeated the nation of Israel and took them captive. The Babylonians in turn defeated the southern tribe of Judah, nation and took them captive. In fact, in 539, when Cyrus defeated the Babylonians, he allowed the Jews to return to their home to rebuild Jerusalem. As I mentioned, this was the beginning of world powers. And the Meo Persian Empire would expand their land beyond the two previous empires. And so they had more land than anyone. And so they were conquering lands, conquering peoples, one of their efforts was to conquer Greece. And so from 500, and a few years after, Cyrus took power, from 500, to about 450, there were Greek Persian Wars that took place in one of those, and you see a little bit of this flavor and Esther is there's banqueting as the the armies go out and come back and, and so Greece is not particularly mentioned there in that text, but that that's within the background of what they're trying to do. Okay. So in 490, purchase set sail for Athens in order to fight against Athens, Greece, and in the distance as the ships are coming there is a man that sees that, and he he runs to Sparta from Athens, to be able to ask for help from the Spartans. And that was no quick trip around the corner. It was not just a couple of blocks, but it was about 150 miles. He was a courier, a messenger, his name was five deputies, five deputies. He runs 150 miles. That's an ultramarathon, right. And he runs back to reports, what happens? Well, when he gets back, the battle is raging. And so he runs 25 miles to the battle that's taking place, Battle of Marathon. And then he runs back to report news of the victory that had taken place there for Athens. So that's 350 miles, and of course of a week or two. And when he comes back, he he has given us all and he reports to the king of Athens. That victory is won, and he promptly dies from exhaustion. This character fi deputies and most modern historians see this to be mythic, at least in some ways. Maybe not all those details are true, but that's the myth that has arisen. And so phi deputies really runs the race of endurance. He runs the race of endurance. And so here's a little motivational poster for you run like five deputies, but finish like someone else. Remember, he gave his life there. Run like five deputies. Today, we celebrate that race of endurance with what we call the marathon. The marathon is a race of endurance that last 26.2 miles and it's based upon this, this mythic run of five deputies who gave his all and who went the distance. In the Summer Olympics. The marathon is both the most iconic events and usually the final and concluding event of, of the Olympics there and often You'll have a 25 mile race around the host city, seeing all the spectacular signs. And again, this is a way to showcase that host city, whatever the sites are. And they'll finish the last mile in the stadium where all the people are gathered.

Jeremy Sweets  05:19
I don't know if you can imagine that. But But running is a is an activity that is repetitive, rhythmic. It's normally a solitary affair, you might run with others, but it's something that you do on your own. marathoners have put in miles upon miles of this pace. And so if you can imagine that steady breathing over a couple of hours, that feet hitting the pavement in a steady, rhythmic way, it's hard to watch on TV, because they're running, they're doing the same thing over and over. But I can imagine being in that marathon running, running and running, but then when you get to the last mile, something is different. You have this solitary, steady pace, you hear your breathing, you hear your feet, but all of a sudden, as you enter into the stadium, the sounds and the mass of people rolls back like like your pillow beneath fright, it just unfolds before you and all of a sudden you don't just hear your own voice, your own breath and rhythmic steps of your your pace. But you hear us and unfolds the crowd before you. And they're cheering you on. As you run those four Final Four laps around and finish the marathon. What an amazing sight. That must be. What an amazing race. You know, the Bible talks about the Christian faith as a race. It uses that imagery. We see in Hebrews chapter 12 mentioned of this race, this race of faith. And before we get there, as was mentioned in the Bible reading and Norm alluded to as well, we find Hebrews chapter 11. Now Hebrews chapter 11, talks about the Hall of Fame of those that have run this faith, race, those that have run this race of endurance. In Hebrews 11, verses one and two, says Now faith is the assurance of things hoped for the conviction of things not seen. For by it, the people of old receive their commendation, and then it's going to list these heroes of the faith, these runners of faith, this hall of fame, I don't know if you've been to a hall of fame, but but normally they'll have a plaque with a statement of their achievement. And they may even have some item like a game worn jersey or or something that you find from their, their career, their life. And so we we take a walk into this museum, this hall have faith, and we see Abels plaque there. And by faith it says that Abel offered an acceptable sacrifice, you may even see a stone there from the sacrifice. He offered his sacrifice in faith, putting his faith in God. We know that his brother did not offer the same type of sacrifice but was selfish and vindictive in his behavior. We come to the next plaque and we see Enoch, Enoch Grande, the faith race and he was taken up. And he walked with God, he lived a life of faith and he he was able to walk literally with God as He was taken. In verse six, we see a description there of this faith race, it says, And without faith, it is impossible to please Him, for whoever draws near to God must believe that He exists, and that he reward those that seek Him. All of these runners, these runners in the faith race were running to attain the prize but we're gonna find out that they were not able to see the prize in front of them, but they ran anyway. And they believe that there is a God and that He will reward them. We come to the next plaque and we see Noah. Noah lived by faith and By faith Noah built an ark in preparation for a rainstorm that had never happened before. But he believed God and he believed his warnings and he Built in Ark, the next plank is of Abraham. By faith Abraham left his home and he left his home at God's command. God told him to go. They told him the direction. But Abraham did not know where he was setting out for he did not know his destination, but he knew his God. He knew his God. It says in verse 10, for he was looking forward to the city that has foundations, whose designer and builder is God. And so we see that in Hebrews chapter 11, and verse 10. Another,

Jeremy Sweets  10:42
another plaque we see as of Sarah, this hall of fame includes men and women, it says, By faith, Sara conceived and bore a child, who bore descendants as numerable, as the stars of heaven in the sand of the seashore. Yes, by faith, Sara bore a child and that child would would have a nation that sprang up from him, and from that nation would come the very savior, Jesus Christ. And so we see Sarah was a hero in this hall of fame. In chapter 11, and verse 13, it says, These all died in faith not having received the things promised, but having seen them and greeted them from afar off, and having acknowledged that they were strangers and exiles on the earth. And then we find that there are many more in this hall of fame. There are many more, and we don't have time to list them all. And there are those that gave their life when we saw that Jerry read about many of those that are not even named by name, but we know that they have run this race of faith. And in verse 39, it says this, in all these, though commended through their faith did not receive what was promised, since God has provided something better for us that apart from us, they should not be made perfect. And so we see something about this race of endurance is that it's something that's continuing on, it's something that they ran, but it is it says that, apart from us, they should not be made perfect, or it should not be completed. And there is a completion aspect, this faith, race is still going on. It's still being run. And then we come to Hebrews chapter 12 And verse one. Therefore, since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses and remember as we enter into that stadium, as we're running that marathon race in the Olympics, in that last mile, as you come into the stadium, and you hear the roar of the crowd, and you see that all the spectators are around watching and listening to you, in our race of faith. It says in Hebrews chapter 12, verse one, we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses. When the Olympic Marathon enters the stadium, he's surrounded by a host of spectators, but in the same way, we are surrounded by a host of heroes of the faith. Now we may think of these, this cloud of witnesses as spectators. I think that's the natural first impression. When you go to the Olympics, spectators are watching the athletes, right? They might not be athletes themselves, any of us could get a ticket and go watch. But I think in Hebrews chapter 12, it's not the aspect of, of a spectator or a disinterested watcher, one that simply buys a ticket and goes and watches. That's not the cloud of witnesses that surrounds us. But these are, are those that are runners themselves, not just disinterested spectators, but those that have put the work in themselves that have run the race themselves that are runners. Can you imagine be a runner going into the crowd and around you is the hall of fame of faith? Well, as Christians, we are surrounded by those that have run the race themselves. Guthrie, in his Hebrews commentary says this, that instead, they bear witness to the Christian community of God's faithfulness and of the effectiveness of the faith. They're not mere spectators I should say but they bear witness to the Christian community of God's faithfulness and the effectiveness of faith. Ff Bruce notes that it's not so much those they who look at us as we who look to them for encouragement So yes, there's a sense of those watching us. But really what we see is a people that have run this race before. And we can run that race looking to them for what they have done. This is a race that is possible.

Jeremy Sweets  15:19
This is a race that has been run before by many men and women of faith. And so we see this this race of faith, this race of faith. I had a picture here of this great cloud of witnesses. This man was Frank Shorter. He ran the 1972 Olympics, he was an American, and he won the gold medal. He was the last American to win the gold medal in the marathon. If you follow running at all, you'll notice that the African countries Kenya, Ethiopia, many of those countries dominate the sport now. But Frank Shorter as he entered into the Olympic crowd, and won that gold medal he was surrounded by that host. And we too, are surrounded by a great cloud of witnesses, a great cloud of witnesses. As we move along, in our text, it says Therefore, since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, let us also lay aside every weight and sin which cleans so closely. And let us run with endurance. You know, I doubt that five deputies was loaded down with heavy armor. Remember, David when he tried on the armor, he was a US but he said this is too heavy for me. It weighs me down. And that's what armor would have would have done it would have protected against a blow but it would have weighed you down. I doubt that fire deputies had heavy armor as he ran his race or carried a bunch of military supplies. He was as light as he possibly could be. As he ran this race today marathoners do the same thing. They carry as little weight with them as possible. Many of them carry as little weight on their bodies as possible. They are skinny gods and skinny women that are running and running. The goal is to finish the race. And a marathoner will shed anything that would weigh them down and stand in their way. And Hebrews chapter 12, we see this, this this weight, therefore, let us lay aside every weight and sin which claims so closely. I don't know if you notice the wording there it says every weight and sin which claims so close. There's actually a little bit of debate on this passage as far as is the Hebrew writer talking about two things are worn. Two things are one. Well we know sin is in the discussion. And sin is a weight. It is a weight that bears us down. Some people equate these two things the the weight, which bears us down every weight and the sin, which cleans so closely are the same thing. It is that sin that entangles us and we know that sin does weigh us down in Psalm 38 And verse four. It says for my iniquities have gone over my head like a heavy burden, they are too heavy for me. Yes, sin weighs us down. In first Corinthians 10 In verse 13, though we see that God is faithful. And he will not let you be tempted beyond what you're able but with the temptation, he will provide you the way of escape, that you may be able to endure it. And here we see this running theme continues because the way of escape from sin is often depicted in terms of running itself. When you see sin, you flee. Joseph when he was entrapped by Potiphar, his wife to commit sexual immorality with him. What did he do? He left his garments and he fled. He was not going to commit sexual immorality was someone else. He had too much respect for God and he knew that would be a sin against God. In Second Timothy two in verse 22, it says so Flee youthful passions, and pursue righteousness, faith, love and peace, along with those who call on the Lord from a pure hearts, the passions of sin, the desires of our flesh, doing what we know is not right. weighs us down, causes us to stumble on this Race, have faith. In first Corinthians six and verse 18, Flee from sexual immorality, Flee from sexual immorality. We are not to pursue the things of the flesh and the sins of the flesh, but we are to pursue

Jeremy Sweets  20:20
the finish line and to live by faith in God. So saying is clearly under discussion, but some people say that there is a second item. And that second item is something other than sin. That means that there are other things that can weigh us down, that are not necessarily sin. And so really, this comes down to a question of priority and discipline to choose what is most important. What is most important, sin clearly is a stumbling block that will prevent us from finishing the race. But there are other things that are not sinful, that can also prevent us from finishing the race. If we would place too great a priority on those things instead of running the race, then we will not be able to finish in Matthew six and verse 33. Jesus lists things of this life that can consume us with worry whether it would be for our food or our clothing. And he says in verse 33, But seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness and all these things will be added to you. Jesus says, Don't worry, but trust. I don't know about you. But I'm a little ashamed when I see you the things that Jesus mentioned. He says, do not worry about food, and clothing, the necessities of our of our life. In our first world country, we tend to obsess over other things, what event I get to go to or, or whether I get to finish my hobby or, or how much money I have in the bank account all of the same, we have a lot of first world worries and problems. But Jesus says even in the fundamental aspects of of life and death, food and clothing, do not worry, but put your trust in God. It is a matter of priority. In First John two and verse 15, Do not love the world nor the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him. For all that is in the world, the desires of the flesh and the desires of the eyes and the pride of life is not from the Father, but is from the world. Do not love the things of this world. Do not make it a priority. Do not let it overcome our race, have faith. Even in things that are most dear to us, we're to put as a place of second priority. Jesus says in Matthew 10, whoever loves father or mother more than Me is not worthy of me. And whoever loves son or daughter more than Me is not worthy of me. And whoever does not take his cross and follow Me is not worthy of me. Whoever finds his life will lose it and whoever loses his life for my sake, we'll find it. There must be an obsessive focus on the race of faith if we are to finish.

Jeremy Sweets  23:31
Let me tell you about a runner in 1980. And this has the makings of an inspirational story. But in 1980, an untested and unproven woman won the Boston Marathon. Her name was Rosie Ruiz, and she was not known as as an a marathoner before she was not known for the races that she had finished. And if you know anything about the Boston Marathon, it's one of the elite races. This is the race that the elite marathoners are striving to win. And so Rosie Ruiz won the race. The problem with Rosie Ruiz is that she jumped on the subway for parts of the race. And so yes, she won. In fact, people notice that wait a minute, she she does not look quite as tired as some of these other racers. She is not sweat through her shirt completely as some of these other races. And the problem is is that she cheated? She cheated. In Second Timothy two and verse five. It says an athlete is not crowned unless he competes according to the rules. I want you to see that we must follow after God and His Word. And sin is contrary to the Spirit and to the rules of the Christian faith. We cannot live in sin and try to run the race. We can't be Rosie Ruiz. Now she was found out for her fraud, and her status as the winner was taken away. We must compete according to the rules. Not only that, but as we move along in our text, we see that we are to run with endurance there since Therefore, since we are surrounded by so great a cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside every weight and sin which clings so closely and let us run with endurance the race that is set before us. The Christian race, the race of faith is a long distance race. The marathon is a long distance race and it's not a sprint. It's not defined by a small stretch of time or a small distance. It is a long distance race. It's a race of endurance, of stamina, of perseverance. The Tyndale New Testament dictionary, New Testament word says that this word endurance can be defined as holding out standing fast insurance or steadfastness it is to continue on to continue further. The Christian life is a marathon does not consist of a single grand act of loyalty. You might think of Peter who offered that to Jesus. Gilbert mentioned that in his class this morning, Peter jumped up and said, I'll die for you. What you want one quick, heroic event, I'll do that. But that's not really what was required. It was not a single sprint. But it was the daily decision of sacrifice of taking up the cross of Jesus and living as a disciple in each and every decision. You might think about that rhythmic pace of the marathon are huge step after step does what he needs to to keep going in the race. The Christian makes decision after decision to do what is right. How many decisions do you think you make in a day? All those decisions are kind of ingrained in us I don't have to think about, you know, routines that I have developed. But there are many decisions that we do make. And just as a marathoner puts one step in front of another as he continues on the Christian makes decision after decision doing what is right, headed in the right direction. The Christian life is a marathon and we are not to be overcome. We are not to give up. When we stumble, we get back up again. running the race that set before us means that we are to continue to grow with each step and with each decision to do what is right we grow in our face. And when we encounter an obstacle or a stumbling block, we we keep going or if we fall, we get back up and keep going. In James one in verse two, it says, Consider it all joy, my brothers when you meet trials of various kinds, for you know that the testing of your faith produces steadfastness. And let steadfastness have its full effect that you may be perfect and complete, lacking in nothing.

Jeremy Sweets  28:32
The more you run the race, the more endurance you'll build. The more steadfastness so let us run this race with endurance. And Romans five in verses three through five it makes a similar statement. Not only that, it says but we rejoice in our sufferings, knowing that suffering produces endurance and endurance produces character, and character produces hope. And hope does not put us to shame because God's love has been poured into our hearts through the Holy Spirit who has been given to us. A marathoner is one that's willing to suffer, to run through the pain and suffer day in and day out, knowing that he is producing insurance so that he can run the race. And so it is for the Christian who continues upon that path and runs the race. I don't have a picture of this next one, but in 1984, was the first year that they had the the women's component of the marathon in the Olympics. And a lady named Joan benaud won that Olympics in 1984. I believe that was Los Angeles. About five minutes after John Joan Bonneau was a lady named Gabriela Anderson sachet. I'm not exactly sure how to say that last night. But as she she came around that track dehydration began to take effect. She had given her all and she began to stumble and some of the race organizers came out wondering, should they help her if they touched her though she had been disqualified a runner is not able to be helped or moved across the finish line. And so as she stumbled, trying to put one foot in front of the other, she finally finished the race. She was a picture of insurance. She had given her all everything that she had, and she ran with insurance. We also see that we are to look to Jesus, and Hebrews 12. Let us run then, race with endurance, the race that is set before us looking to Jesus, the founder and perfecter of our faith, who for the joy that was set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame and is seated at the right hand of the throne of God. You may not remember this, but our theme this year, is looking to Jesus. Looking to Jesus, it's important that we look to Jesus. I saw a meme that said that churches began this year saying, let's let's develop 2020 vision, as we put our our faith in Jesus and look to Jesus and his 2020 unfolds that we say we didn't see that coming. Developing all this I saw we didn't see that coming. Well, the point of our our theme is not that we can predict the future is it though. It's that despite what happens, we know who's still in control. And I think it's a good thing for that reason. We couldn't have predicted this, this virus. But yet despite it, we still know who's in control. I saw another billboard. I saw this just Friday as I coming along. And it was a church and said, I can't wait to say Hindsight is 2020. I can't wait to put this year behind this. And I know many people feel that way. But as we run this Christian what race we are to look to Jesus, not only are we surrounded by a cloud of witnesses who have run the race, those that have have lived a life of faith. But we also see Jesus who is the author and perfecter of our faith. He is one also that has run the race, and provided an example for us. And so we look to him as one that has done it. He's run the race, we see that he established our faith by doing the very thing that he is asking us to do. And that is that he endured until the end, he perfects our faith and that he provides an example for us to look to. We can endure, look, we can learn ginger by looking to Jesus and his example. Notice that he considered the joy that was set before him. At the first side of pain or the first feeling of pain, Jesus didn't quit. Jesus didn't say this is too difficult, but rather he he looked for the prize. He saw the joy set before him. That's what we've been talking about in Hebrews 11 and 12. Here.

Jeremy Sweets  33:32
They kept running, believing that God would give the prize even though they didn't get it immediately. And so Jesus had the joy that was set before Him. And it says that he despised or disregarded the shame. He continued on through the difficulty. And he and you're in first Peter to 18 through 25. It says that Jesus did not return evil for evil. But instead he continued in in godliness. He continued to run the race. It's not that Jesus enjoyed suffering. You may remember that he said, like this cup, I believe that's a cup of suffering. He says, let this cup pass from me that was what he wanted. But regardless of whether he suffered or not, he says, I'm going to run the race. Whatever you want me to do, God, your will be done. His focus was on doing what is right. It's not that he enjoyed suffering. But what he did was he put his suffering in context. And he realized that there is a purpose to this, and he continued on. Jesus is our help. In 1992, there was an Olympic race, the 400 meter race, and a man named Derek Redmond as he came around the final turn. Actually, it was the third turn there. He took his hamstring. And so you can imagine 400 is a pretty quickly paced race. It's once around the track. And as he's running, he pulls up completely tore his hamstring, he falls to the ground, his face is in the ground. And he's devastated. It's hard to imagine the amount of time that goes into the preparations for Olympics. And in that moment, he was crushed. But he did not stop the race. He stood up and on one leg, he began to try to hop forward. And I've never taught her hamstring. But I can only imagine how painful that would be. Well, as he continued to hop his father came alongside him. This is an emotional video, you should go home and watch it. His father comes alongside, and he puts his arm around it, and he helps him finish the race. He helps him finish the race. Jesus is our help. Jesus is our advocates. When we fall, he's the one that picks us up and walks along beside us. God Jesus in the spirit lifts our spirits in Psalm 55 and 22. It says, Cast your burden on the Lord and He will sustain you. In Matthew 11, in verse 28, come to me all who labor and are heavy laden, and I will give you rest. Take my yoke upon you and learn from me for I am gentle and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls for my yoke is easy, and my burden is light. It's not that there's not a burden. And there's not a yoke as a Christian there is. But we have Jesus as the one that's walking beside us and with us, leading the way leading the way. Jesus is our hill. Not only that, but we also see that there is a reward that awaits those who endure. In Second Timothy two in verse 12. It says, If we endure, we will also reign with Him. In Second Timothy four in verse seven, it says, I have fought the good fight, I have finished the race. Notice what Paul's saying this Christian life is a race. And as he was about to die, he's saying, I've finished this race, the Christian race of faith. Henceforth, there's later for me the crown of righteousness, which the Lord the righteous judge will award to me on that day. And not only to me, but also all who have loved His appearing. Those that run this race will receive the crown. In Corinthians that talks about normally a runner would receive a crown of wreath, you know, of the garlin the greenery put around. But we are not striving for that craft.

Jeremy Sweets  38:05
We're striving for an imperishable friend, that will not fail, that will not fade away. And that's why we can say with Paul and Romans eight and verse 18, For I consider that the sufferings of this present time are not worth comparing with the glory that is to be reviewed. The suffering of the race is not compared to be compared with the glory of the prize that we will receive. It's worth the suffering, it is worth the suffering. Yes, friends, we're to run the Christian race today. And in summary, as I talk about a few of these things, let's let's consider the fact that if we're to run the Christian race today, we need to look to Scripture, we need to look to what God has told us to do. He has guided us, not only in what we should do, but in examples of those that have run the race before us. So let us look to scripture for encouragement. Let us be encouraged by others, we are surrounded by a hall of fame of faith. I think that includes not only those individuals specified in Hebrews chapter 11, but you saw that it's a race that continues. There are still those that will not be written down with their name in Scripture, but still belong to that hall of fame of faith and you may know them and maybe your dad or your granddad or or a preacher that you knew or an elder or an older lady that had been running the race and influenced you in your face. The world may never note those runners of faith, but they influence us don't they? And we can be appreciative for the example and the encouragement that they give us. Whether they are continuing to live or not. We need to remove obstacles holes, anything that would get in our way, we need to move it out of the way, we need to move sin out of our way any other priority that would take precedence over God, move it out of the way. We need to consider our reward and keep our eyes on the prize to continue to run the race, realizing that all this suffering is worth it, because one day we will have the reward that God Himself will give us. And if we learn anything from Hebrews 11 and 12, we run the race, believing that God will give us every war. We don't have it now, but God will give it we must practice discipline, a daily discipline of continuing to run even in spite of the difficulties. And we must also put hardship in context. Yes, there are struggles and trials and difficulties that we must face. But if we put those in context, we'll see that it's worth it. It's worth it to run the race to follow after Him. And let us look to Jesus, I do think it's a good thing. It's an excellent thing, even though we didn't see this virus coming. We know Who holds the future. And we know Who holds our hand. And so we follow after God, let us run the Christian race today. Maybe there's someone here today that needs to respond to the invitation. It's an invitation that God gives you to either begin the race if you're not a Christian, by believing that Jesus is the Christ repenting of your sins, confessing Jesus as the Christ and being baptized. Or it may be that you've started running the race, but you found it too difficult and too long and so you've stopped. If you're not living as you should. You've made that initial decision as a Christian but you're not continuing the race. We would love to pray with you and for you at this time. There's any subject to the invitation please come as we stand and sing at this time. Are you
