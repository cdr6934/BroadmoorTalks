Good morning. Good to see everyone here today, we have a big crowd, we've got a new backsplash back there. There's a lot going on. But we're certainly glad that you're here with us, we're certainly glad to be able to worship God together. So I thank you for your attendance and worshiping with me this morning. You may, you're probably aware that it is Mother's Day, I want to wish all those that are mothers, Happy Mother's Day, we rejoice but Deb Smith gets to enjoy her first Mother's Day with I don't know two or three day old, baby. So we're happy about that. I know that I've been greatly benefited by my mom and also a godly wife, as a mother to our children. We just talk about that a little bit, not necessarily my wife, but Mother's Day. That is I struggled a little bit with what to talk about this morning. So that's often a preacher struggle, right? What what to talk about, the effort is to be balanced in what we do to address many different subjects. And try to be relevant, you try to deal with things that are out there. So Mother's Day creates one of those questions about what to preach on. I've preached on mother's before, but I'm also aware that there are women for which Mother's Day is a painful day, that we'd like to be mothers and have not been able to, or maybe have lost children, or those that that are just having difficulty. So I want to be aware of that too. And I want to notice that. So with that in mind, I'm going to talk about the fact that the church values when the church values women, and will make a point on on Mothers, but the lesson in general will be on on women, and the fact that the church, God the scriptures, value women, I think this is an important topic. Our world today is in many ways consumed with this idea of gender, and equality among gender. And a lot of discussions are going on not only in society in the world, but also among people that look to scriptures. And so I thought it would be helpful for us to consider this subject this morning.

And Romans 16, we see that Paul concludes his letter to the Romans with a long list of greetings or salutations that he gives to the church. They're the first person he mentions, there's found in the first two verses, and he says this. I commend to you, our sister, Phoebe, a servant of the church at sin, Korea, that you may welcome her in the Lord in a way worthy of the saints and help her in whatever she may need from you. For she has been a patron of many, and of myself, as well. Paul, they're here commands and begins with a commendation for Phoebe. She is a servant. He appreciates and values what she brings to the table. And I think that's important for us to notice. Fact, the Scripture is filled filled with statements about appreciation of the value of women. And I think it would do well for us to consider those points. But even my sermon title, you may or may not recognize this is a controversial statement. The world does not necessarily believe that the church values women. In fact, there's one quote here from a man and all you have to do is type in church women. And you'll probably get a long list of quotes that are similar to this. This man Stephen Madsen, had written a book on on this subject and in an article where he reviews that book he says this. American Christianity has been a horrible place for women. It ignores them, abuses them assault stone, objectifies them, oppresses them, and then attempts to theologically rationalize it all as being biblical and holy. The church has been a willing, no, no, I didn't do that. Alright, the church has been a willing co conspirator in the widespread affliction of women. Christianity has a history of manipulating the Bible to reinforce patriarchy, in which men are seen as spiritual leaders and women are to submit to their authority. Women are intentionally excluded from roles of authority and their truth, wisdom and experiences have been unfairly dismissed. Again, there are a whole host of statements like this, making accusation against the church that the church is behind much of the oppression that happens toward women. I don't know about you, but when I hear this and read this, I feel like a little bit like someone's been talking about my family. I feel defensive. This doesn't seem fair to me. Well, Christians are to be first and foremost listeners. Excellent. listeners, James 119. B, be quick to hear and slow to speak. And so I want to take in what's being said here. And I want to acknowledge that there have been abuses. And so we need to be aware of that. In fact, these articles normally go in two different directions. One of them talks about actual cases of abuse that occurred against women. And I condemn that that happen or I condemn. When that happens, I acknowledge that it does. And when we talk about the church, where we're talking about a few different levels, we're talking about what the church should be what God instituted what he wants it to be. But we also have to recognize that the church is filled with people. And the church at times does not act as it should. And so we want to see that and acknowledge that that's one path of the idea of the oppression of women. Another path is from the position that would restrict women from leadership roles. And by taking that position, it is an oppression of women. So I want to look at at all these things today. I believe that the church based upon what God has said, in the Scriptures does value women. And I think we need to be more aware of how we can appreciate that. So let us notice a few things. First of all, the church values women as image bearers, as image bearers. In the very beginning in Genesis 126, and 27. The pinnacle or the highlight of God's creation occurs on day six, and it is for man and woman. And verse 26, it says, Then God said, Let us make man in our image after our likeness, and let them have dominion over and I'll summarize the animals. So God, verse 727, so God created man in His own image, and the image of God, He created him, male and female, He created them. The word here man is a general sense and not necessarily meaning male, God created mankind humankind. But it makes a special point to say that God created them male and female, God did not simply give his image his likeness to men. And then women were an afterthought. Now God created men and women, with his divine image with his likeness. And so we need to be very aware of that statement. Men and women. Now, all people are created in the image of the creator. And as such, all people have intrinsic value and worth, and they are created and loved by God. And it may seem silly to say, but this includes women, I say, it seems silly to say because it seems so obvious to me. But that's not always been carried out. In practice. There are many times where women have been mistreated, abused in society, and it's even taking place in the church. Many men throughout history have used their their physical strength, their power, their place in society, to demean women. And that that is a sad thing. I condemn that. And as a church, we need to stand up for the value and the importance of women. Let me just mention a few ways that societies have have done this. Some societies have limited the number of children a couple can have. And so many of those families would abort or kill a daughter because she was a daughter, because they wanted boys. Human trafficking continues to plague the world where little girls and women are forced into sexual slavery. Two thirds of trafficking victims in the United States are actually citizens. And I've heard a number close to 50,000 are trafficked into the United States in a year. What a sad, sad shame.

Jeremy Sweets  09:13
Many men exercise sinful control of women and girls through physical sexual and emotional abuse. And again, I'll say this even takes place in the church. Pornography exploits and degrades women, even those women that would say that they were willing participants, many men carry the mistaken belief that women are simply inferior, and they treat them in a demeaning way through their comments and through their actions. And I'm sure we could find another whole list of ways that women have been mistreated, that that's not the way of Christ and that's not the way of Christians. The way of Christians is to appreciate. Consider the worth and value and treat each person and especially women with the dignity and respect that they deserve. And so let us be aware that men and women bear the image of God and they deserve full respect for that. While the church values women as wives and mothers, as wives and mothers, again, we look at the creation. And we see in Genesis chapter two and verse 18, after Man was created from the dust of the ground, it was found that he was lacking, he did not have a suitable companion. And so it says, in Genesis 218, than the Lord God said, it is not good, that man should be alone, I will make him a helper fit for him. When we heal the word helper, we often think in terms of class structure, maybe importance or worth, I remember when my dad would often work on whatever it was around the house, I could be as helper, which meant he did the work and I stood there holding the screwdriver, you know, ready to hand to him. And so we have this view of a helper as someone that is inferior in some sense, but I want you to know that that is not how this word is used at all. It does not indicate subordinate or lower worth or value. fact this is the same word that is typically used of God being a help to those that are in need. And so we see that it, it recognizes ability, it recognizes the ability to fill in what is needed. And that's exactly what the woman did for man. Her gifts, talents and abilities complete what is lacking in the man. It's not a place of inferiority for either gender there, but rather we see that they complement one another, and they should be appreciated in that sense. The Bible says that a godly wife is a treasure, something to be valued. And proverbs 31 In verse 10, says an excellent wife who can find she is far more precious than jewels, the heart of her husband trusts in her and he will have no lack of gain. Wives are extremely valuable to a husband, more than than money more than jewels, and we see the value there of wives godly wives. husbands should treat their wives with love and respect. We see this in Ephesians chapter five, verse 25, there are talks about husbands being leaders, but notice the way that they are to lead. They are to lead by subjecting their wants and desires for what is good for their why. So in a sense, they are submitting their own will in order to lead and such it is for biblical leaders. They serve Ephesians five verse 25, it says Husbands love your wives as Christ loved the church and gave Himself up for her. What a tall task. Men are to lead through extreme service, love, and devotion. It is not a time to boast about some kind of leadership thing that's not what's found in Scripture. And Ephesians five, verse 28, it says, In the same way husband should love their wives as their own body. And so be a giving person loving, respecting, cherishing, being kind.

Jeremy Sweets  13:33
Again, in first Peter three in verse seven, says, Husbands, live with your wives in an understanding way, showing honor to the woman as the weaker vessel, since they are heirs with you of the grace of life, so that your prayers may not be hindered. Many people look at this word, weak or weaker vessel and they focus a lot of attention on that, that this passage is filled with the extreme value and worth of women, they are heirs the grace of life, they are to be honored, they are to be cherished, weaker here likely refers simply to physical strength. And I know our society wants to say that there might be no difference between strength between men and women, but in general, it's just simply a fact that men have greater physical strength. I know we've got Wonder Woman and and the the super women, but know that that is not a statement of inferiority in any way. Strength is not a physical strength is not the most important. Character is important. And so we see that Husbands are to live and an understanding way. Notice that with their physical strength, they are not to use that in an unrestrained way. And that's often when you get abuse. And so men are to to restrain Any impulses they would have toward anger or demeaning, and they are to cherish and love their wives. What a great task. And they are to do that because women deserve that they deserve the respect of being an equal partner, an air in the grace of life. Being a mother is also a vitally important job. And I'll simply say this, that there are many positive aspects in our societies crusade if I could use that word for women, women do deserve fair treatment at work and equitable pay. But one of the things I'm worried about is that motherhood has gotten in the crosshairs of this idea of gender equality. And each family will have to decide whether and how much a woman will work outside the home. But I want you to know that motherhood is not an obstacle or motherhood is an opportunity. It should be cherished and valued. So whatever decisions you would make in that regard, as far as work structure, and each family is going to have to do that. Do not overlook or consider unimportant, the job of being a mother. And that is important for us to understand and recognize mothers are worthy of our respect and Proverbs 31 In verse 28, it says Her children rise up and call her blessing, her husband also and he praises her. I think we need more of that, praising and appreciation. So the church values women as wives and mothers. The church also values women as disciples and church members. Redemption is found in Christ and it is not divided or split by gender. That is true for all people, men and women are found to be sinners before God because they have chosen a way that transgresses his will. Men and women have an opportunity to be redeemed through Christ, and there is no again discrimination based on on on external factors. Women are equal members of the kingdom of God, they are not second class citizens. And Galatians three in verse 26, it says, For in Christ Jesus, you are all sons of God, through faith, is he just talking about males? No, he was talking about one particular son a seed that would come through Jesus Christ, and they use his sons here, I think, in a general sense. And we even see that clearly as we read on. For as many of you as were baptized in the Christ have put on Christ, there is neither Jew nor Greek, there is neither slave nor free, there is no male and female, for your all one in Christ Jesus. God does not discriminate based upon nationality or race, based upon social standing, and he does not discriminate based upon gender. God does not consider a woman to be lesser in any way. She can be one in Christ, with those that are in Christ, and we need to see and appreciate this truth that should be reflected in our attitudes, we should not treat women as second class citizens in the kingdom. This is true in the church as well. Women are full and vital members of the body, the church.

Jeremy Sweets  18:36
Steven Mattson said that the wisdom experiences and and the truth of women have been simply discarded, they have been intentionally excluded. And if that's true, then shame on us. Having a man be an elder does not mean that we should exclude the thoughts and ideas of women. A godly husband will not just roll blindly, but he will understand and know his wife so that he can serve her better. I think that's what our elders are attempting to do, as well know not just what the men think, but what the women think and feel in order to better serve. And so we need to see that that the church should not be in the business of intentionally excluding or putting to shame, anyone. It is a shame that that happens. No person, no member should feel alone or excluded in the church. And I know that happens from time to time, but that's a lesson for all of us to be busy serving one another, to reach out to those that may find themselves in that situation. And First Corinthians 12 Verse 12, it says For the body does not consist of one member, but many, and it goes on to teach that all are equally important. And I again, just want to make that explicit. be clear when it comes to gender. Men and women are so vitally needed as members of the body. All right, let's keep going. I hope this is not too heavy. I meant this to be a positive statement. I feel like I'm dealing with a lot of statements and on Mother's Day, right? I hope this can be a positive sermon as well. The church values women as Bible students and teachers as Bible students and teachers. Bible Study and Learning is not an activity reserved for the men. God wants women to be Bible students and teachers as well. Notice particularly as we start with Bible students, in First Timothy two verses eight through 15, that has really become a battleground over this idea of gender and especially gender roles in the church. There's probably been more ink spilled on this passage than any other really in our day. But one of the often overlooked components of this passage is found in verse 11. And notice how verse 11 starts, let a woman learn. I don't hear that emphasized a lot. I hear a lot of the other points debated, but it says let a woman learn. Now this is extremely important considering that day in time, when women were not typically given the educational opportunities of men, women were often excluded from education. But Paul elevates the status and role of women here and he encourages women let the women learn, and he wants them to learn. Now if we would consider that exportation in light of this entire passage, they are to have an atmosphere in which learning is encouraged. It is to be free from male pride and control through anger and fights and displays of anger. And we see that in verse eight, men are the lift up holy hands, create an environment where women can learn. This environment is to be free from an obsession on appearance and competition among women about outward things, it should be free from that and we see that in verses nine and 10. External beauty is not the focus of any Christian, but rather the beauty of the hearts and the character. And verse 11, it says she has to learn quietly with all submissiveness. Again, the fourth point is that she has to be a learner. But there is a way that that is to happen, not boisterous challenging of authority or the teaching. And that's true for all that would receive the teaching, is it not? And so she is to learn, it says quietly. Now, this is not a statement about utter silence, but rather a spirit and a disposition that is ready to receive that is humble and ready to receive. And again, I would suggest that that's needed for all Bible students, this attitude of seeking to learn.

Jeremy Sweets  23:08
We see also that submissiveness as it mentions here, should not be considered a dirty word. Now I know it is in our society, to say submit is a red flag and people automatically go to those quotes, like we see from Stephen Madsen saying that this is an abomination. But submissiveness is an important aspect of the Christian life. It simply is all Christians are to submit, all Christians are to submit. It's not a dirty word, but that is that is, that is what we seek. That is the manner in which we are to live that is following after the example of Christ. And so we need to be submissive. Let's also notice women as teachers, women are encouraged in the New Testament to share the gospel message. Notice, notice if you would in Second Timothy two and verse two, Second Timothy two and verse two. Here it says, And what you have heard from me, in the presence of many witnesses, entrust the faithful men who will be able to teach others also, Paul tells Timothy that you have heard and receive the gospel message, and you're to teach others who will then go and teach others this is the nature of Christianity. You might notice that the word here says that and trust this to faithful men. That word there is the general word again for mankind or humanity and does not necessarily restrict itself to males. Greek has a word for male, and it's not used in this passage. So we might say, trust the faithful people who will be able to teach others as well. I believe this includes men and women. They are To be those that share the gospel message. And we see this all throughout Scripture. Women are to be teachers who take the word to other. This corresponds with the testimony in Scripture, you may notice that the women were the first ones to witness the resurrection. And they went and proclaimed it. Phillips unmarried daughters prophesied and x 21. In Philippians, four verse three, Paul claim that women laid labored side by side with me in the Gospel. And Titus two says older women are to teach younger women, women are to be Bible students and teachers. I believe that was radical in that day. Now, we may have a different view dealing with our society in a different way. But that is an amazing statement. Women are to be Bible students and teachers. Now, I do want to point out that there is a restriction that is placed on this in first Timothy chapter two, much of the debate on women's role has focused on leadership positions. And to deny a woman a leadership position is according to Mattson, to manipulate the Bible to reinforce patriarchy. Well, in First Timothy two and verse 12, Paul adds a restriction to women as teachers, I do not permit a woman to teach a woman to teach or to exercise authority over a man, rather, she has to remain quiet. Now, I'll point out that those that would promote greater role for women in the church are not simply disregarding scripture, in fact, they will make their point from Scripture. And there's a lot of points that are made on that. So there's a lot I hope, we don't simply say that this is a simple cut and dried issue, no questions asked. There's a lot of study that has gone into this. Many commentators will, will say that this does not apply today. And we'll do this in two ways. One is to consider the situational nature of the epistles, the epistles were written to address a particular situation. And they would say that there is a particular situation in Ephesus here, where women were were usurping authority. And so Paul tells that particular group of women, that they are to be subordinate, they are to learn quietly. Well, Paul points back, though, to the creation order, when he provides this restriction saying that men were created first. And then women.

Jeremy Sweets  27:29
There was another point that's made. And and I made a little bit of this point by saying that Paul, actually elevated women in the status of society. And so many people would make this argument that there is a progressive art for women as compared to society. And so as our society changes, and now has greater free freedoms, even for women, then we need to continue to allow that greater freedom. Again, this is an argument that has been unconvincing to me. But it is something to consider and think about, we will make those same kind of points when it comes to things like slavery, or things where we are different than the society. So it is something to look at and consider. But from my understanding, looking at scripture, women are not granted the right to serve as elders or church leaders. In that sense. What's sad about this whole debate, is that it's really become a screaming match over preeminence and who's in charge. And I'm gonna remind it a little bit about a passage of the Christopher referred to where disciples were arguing about who's the greatest, I hope that's not what this debate is, we're all to be submissive to be servants. And it should not be a screaming match about who's in charge. But it should be a wake up call for really, what we're doing and why we're doing it. Let me point out as well that biblical leaders and related that are first and foremost servants, I made this point with godly husbands, they sacrifice what they want for the greater benefit of the group. And I think elders are doing the same thing. It is not a question about who's in charge. That's not how we see leadership. And so we shouldn't think in those terms. Well, let me look at one other point and that is as servants the church values women as servants. Now all Christians are called to be servants. Some of the best servants of the church has been and continue to be women. Many women form the backbone of congregations sometimes when men have turned away from the Lord, sometimes when there is a great need there. Women continue to be a backbone of the church. And First Timothy five verses nine and 10. It talks about enrolling widows into the the care from the church treasury. And it says that those widows and I think this is true of women. This is a statement a woman at the end of her life who's lost her husband, her, her entire life has been filled with these things. And so I think this expands beyond widows. It's not just when you get to the end, but all through life. Women should be filled with these kinds of things. And verse nine, it says, let a woman a widow be enrolled if she is not less than 60 years of age, having been the wife of one husband, and notice having a reputation for good works, if she has brought up children has shown hospitality has washed the feet of the saints, has cared for the afflicted and has devoted herself to every good work. Yes, women are servants and we value the church values women for their service. Now while there does appear to be a restriction on women as exercising authority over man, I think there can be a strong may case made for female deaconesses Phoebe is called a servant of the church, and that is a generic word that is used the servant that is the same word as Deacon, just as elder it has a generic sense in which it is used for an older man, but in a special sense and an office kind of sense, a recognized position. We see that older men elders are those that were selected for that work, deacons, men, servant men are selected for that work. I think there can be a case made for a deaconess not in a leadership position, but in a position of service. Now, I'm not trying to make any changes at Broadmoor. And honestly, whether a deaconess is publicly identified or not, that's not going to stop godly women from serving the church is. In some ways, it's a moot point whether we recognize this officially or not. You know, I look through this audience. I think I would embarrass several minute women if I named their names but they are known here at Broadmoor, as servants of the church, whether we would have any kind of recognition of Dekas Deaconess, they are known as servants. Quite honestly, I think if I started calling out names, I could go down the list of people I see here, it would embarrass them to death. And I don't want to do that. Right. What's funny is I don't have to name their name, because you know,

Jeremy Sweets  32:30
there are so many women here that are serving the church, and what a great what a great benefit to the cause of the kingdom. What a great benefit to Broadmoor. What a great benefit to the Lord. The church values women, and we should to God values women, the church values women. And let me just talk real quickly to the men, we're not known for our our ability to express ourselves. But maybe we need to speak up a little bit more and express our appreciation for the women in our life. mothers, wives, daughters, but also the servants here at Broadmoor, those that are serving the church, the godly examples, we see those that have helped, helped us there are there are many women here that have taken a special interest in my children. Not because there's any kind of physical family relationship, but because they simply love and care. And they've provided much benefit for us. So men, let's speak up and express our appreciation. If you're here this morning, and you're not a Christian, I've not talked a lot about that. But you've seen some important aspects. Being a Christian it means to submit ourselves to submit our will and to put God first and foremost. And that's true when it comes to becoming a Christian. We must believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living God, we must repent and turn away from selfishness and sin and turn to him, commit ourselves to Him. And we must be baptized in the water for forgiveness of sins. If you're here and you've not done that you have an opportunity God is himself is calling you to obey the gospel message. If you're here this morning and you are a Christian and you're not honoring the commitment you made when you were baptized, then you also need to make changes. If there are any subject to the invitation. Please come as we stand and sing at this time.
