Good evening. It's good to see everyone here today, and certainly good that we can gather together to worship our God, we are starting to film more and more of those faces in between we're looking a little fuller, I think every time I speak to you, so it's good to good to be with you 1960s I like to read books about history. And there's a couple of periods that always kind of grabbed my attention. One of those is probably World War Two, but neither one of those is found in the 1960s. So as an interesting decade, as a time of social upheaval and unrest is also a time marked by prosperity. We have things like the the space race and headed to the moon, where there was one small step for man and one giant leap for mankind. We find a lot going on in the world stage. This was the time during the Cold War, where east and west were in conflict with one another. We were building not only rockets to go to the moon, but more and more bombs and bigger and bigger bombs. There was floors that were happening, there was conflict in in the United States, again, between social classes and generations and cultures. This was the time of the Civil Rights Movement. This was a time when there were several assassinations in the decade, there was the hippie movement, protests and riots. There was a lot that was going on. What are the key components of this social critique that came at this time came through music, and came through folk and rock music in particular. In 1959, Pete Seeger wrote a song entitled Turn, turn turn. This song skyrocketed in popularity when the birds recorded it in 1965. So a quick trivia question for you, who penned the lyrics for the it was, I'm not gonna be able to get this out. Right. But let me try the oldest author to penned the lyrics to some to a song that went number one on the Billboard charts in the United States. Ecclesiastes, so the preacher is known for having the oldest lyrics in a song that reach number one. This song was taken by enlarge from Ecclesiastes. And so that's what I'd like for you to look at for a few moments this morning, or this evening. So Pete Seeger only wrote a few words in the song, including the title, turn, turn, turn, and the final two lines, and a time for every purpose under heaven, we see that the bulk of what he the song comes from Ecclesiastes three verses one through eight, please, he asked these three, one through eight, and I've included a section after that to look at tonight. Now I was asked to preach her to teach a class on Ecclesiastes three. And I'll just forewarn you, this is a little bit dangerous. So this is like someone that only catches the first part of a sermon that says you're lost in sin. And they don't hear the rest of the story. Studying in Ecclesiastes is a little bit like that. If you're just going through the first through first few chapters, you really are getting a pessimistic view. And the the author of this book is called The preacher. And he was a skilled preacher. Because if you're to take someone to the highs of the gospel message and see the glory of that, you have to show people the muck in the mire, to see how great it is or what you need to escape from. Well, we spend most of our time in Ecclesiastes and the muck, and the mire, and a pessimistic view and a, an unsettled view as he tries to look at meaning and purpose in life and as he struggles with and it's really at the end that we get the conclusion. So I put that warning to the sermon, I'm not gonna jump to chapter 12 immediately, but I want to, I want to look at his reasoning and how he deals with time. And I want to consider that subject tonight. There is a time for everything. When we look at the

Jeremy Sweets  04:30
first few chapters of pleasee assays, we see that there is a frustration that comes with time. There is a frustration that comes with time. First of all, we see that time is fleeting, and we all have an experience with this. There's never enough time. There's never enough hours in the day. I got accomplished a little bit, but not as much as I would have liked to. I just simply don't have have enough time. And then you add in school you add in kids, you add in other responsibilities, and the time simply begins to shrink. And yes, I know we all have the same amount of time. But it seems like it shrinks, doesn't it? And James for in verse 14, and James may be quoting Ecclesiastes, but there he says, of life, that our life is but a vapor, but a mist. And he may be quoting Ecclesiastes, because the theme that runs through the first part of Ecclesiastes, as, as the preacher considers life under the sun is this and that's found and really the the first verse or the second verse, Vanity of vanities, says the preacher, Vanity of vanities, all is vanity. Now the key phrase there is striving after the wind, the word vanity there really means simply a breath of vapor, a mist. And so a very well may be what was quoted in James for in verse 14, but metaphorically, it refers to something that is that is useless. That is pointless. And so we start off this very encouraging book with these words, everything is pointless. And then he's going to hash out that over the next few chapters, everything is useless. I was a tough preacher. Well, he does conclude and get to the message at the end, but that that is a tough message. And that is what he, he considers, and Ecclesiastes one and verse four, he says this, a generation goes and a generation comes, but the earth remains forever. When it comes to humans, people, time is fleeting generations come and generations go. Many of you may have lived through that 60s, but we understand time marches on, time keeps going, time is fleeting, and there can be a genuine frustration with that. Next, we see that time renders work, useless. Now, this is not the father lecture that I give my parents, my kids, right. This is not the kind of instruction that I tell them. But the preacher here considers the fact that time renders work useless. And chapter two and verse 11. The preacher had much experience with with all sorts of things, he was one that had worked in many ways. And notice what he says in chapter two and verse 11, then are considered all the my hands and done and the toil and expended and doing it. And behold, all was vanity, and a striving after when, and there was nothing to be gained under the sun. In verses 18 and 19, he continues to consider the fact that time renders work useless. And he says this, I hated all my toil in which I toil under the sun, saying that I must leave it to the man who will come after me. And who knows whether he will be wiser or full, yet he will be master of all which I toiled and used my wisdom under the sun, this also is vanity, this also is vanity,

Jeremy Sweets  08:34
we have some sense of this idea of work is useless, and that there is a need to do the same job over and over again, you do a job only to need to do it again. You know, you get your children reading the Bible, and then all of a sudden, they turn that logic on you, you say, make up your bed, and they say, what's the point? It's only gonna be messy the next night? Why should I have to go through that it is pointless, useless to have to go through that. Or you might think of a person that spends his entire life building up a business, only to pass it on to the next generation, who didn't have to go through the toil and labor to build it up. It was given to them they might not have had the same interest, and then they run the business into the ground. Now, that doesn't happen every time but it is a common tale. And so what was the point? I spent my entire life building up this business, only for it to fail. The preacher says in chapter 218, and 19, even if I apply myself in wisdom, what about the next guy? And so you see that as time marches on, a lot of our work, our hard work, even our life's work, can be rendered useless, rendered useless, and don't even talk to me about trying to pull the weeds. I just pulled those weeds. Now there's more weeds. And now there's more weeds. I, you can't get ahead of that, can you? And so you have this frustration with time. It renders work, useless. Time also a racist pleasure, time a racist pleasure. Notice in chapter two, in verses one through three pleasure was one of the things that the preacher considered does this bring meaning to life? You know I worked hard. Well let me try pleasure and he says this. I said in my heart come now I will test you with pleasure, enjoy yourself. But behold, this also was vanity. I said of laughter It is mad and a pleasure what uses it, I searched with my heart, how to cheer my body with one, my heart's still guiding me with wisdom, and how to lay hold on folly, till I might see what was good for the children of man to do under heaven. During the few days of their life. Here we see that he considers pleasure is their meaning and that is their purpose. And we might even word it like that. Is there anything lasting? And the answer is no. The answer is no. As the alcoholic How long does that last? Do you need to get more alcohol to fulfill whatever that gave you? Now that's so momentary. We we just recently came back from a week in Florida. And I feel like we spent two or three weeks worth of work in that first week to try to go there. And now that's a memory. That's, that's past. We had a good time. But time erases that pleasure. It's it's done. It's over. And we have some sense of this as Christians, don't we? And Hebrews it talks about Moses, he he he did, he resisted the passing pleasures of sin. Sin is for a season. And so maybe this in part is a helpful reminder. But there's a frustration here from the preacher that that time renders what we know. useless, pointless, and that is it comes to an end, it comes to an end. Time also makes us forgettable. Maybe some of you are into genealogy. But I would guess there's very few that could name your great grandparents. When were they born? What was their full name? That that's just a few generations up. Great, great grandparents three great, tell me their name anything about him? Or even if you know their name, that may be all you know about them? Do you think your great great kids are going to know your name. When you were born anything about you? Boy, this is depressing. This is heavy but this is the frustration. This is exactly what the preacher was dealing with. There's nothing lasting here. Time makes us forgettable and chapter one and verse 11. He says this, there is no remembrance of former times a former things nor will be there any remembrance of later things yet to be among those who come after

Jeremy Sweets  13:36
what was passed has already been forgotten. And guess what about right now? It too will be forgotten. It too will be forgotten. In chapter two and verse 16. There it says, For of the wise as of the fool, there is no engineering remembrance, saying that in the days to come all have been long forgotten how the wise dies, just like the fool, is it? Is it good to have wisdom? While the preacher says I used to think so. But really the end of both the wise and the foolish is the same thing. So what's the point? So what's the point? You see the frustration with the time and I might put it like this? His argument as he begins is that all is vanity and time is a central component to his argument. All is vanity because nothing is lasting. Everything in this life is temporal. As time marches on. It renders our work, our life, our experiences, our pleasures, it renders it. Momentary comes to an end. So the preacher is grappling. And so it's very easy to go to the next point say, if that's the case, then what's the point? Point, life is pointless, life is pointless. Well, that brings us to these lyrics that the birds and Pete Seeger saw and use. At a time when there was great social upheaval, there was times of constant change. And the words are this and I'll read Ecclesiastes three, one through eight. For everything, there is a season, a time, for every matter under heaven, a time to be born and a time to die, a time to plant and a time to pluck up what is playing, a time to kill and a time to heal, a time to break down and a time to build up, a time to weep, and a time to laugh, a time to mourn and a time to dance. A time to cast away stones and a time together stones together, a time to embrace and a time to refrain from embracing, a time to seek and a time to lose a time to keep and a time to cast away. A time to tear and a time to sow a time to keep silence and a time to speak. A time to love and a time to hate, a time for war, and a time for peace. There is a time and appropriate time. We even see this later in verse 11. He has made everything beautiful in its time or appropriate. And it's time, there is a time for everything. And again, I think this is said from a statement of frustration. We spent all those years making peace. And now we're at war again. We went to war so we can accomplish this goal. And then there's peace. But then there's war again. Or we can count the number of births that occur in a year, there's this many births. Well, guess what? There's this many deaths. And so we see there is a time there is this cyclical nature to things. And you get the sense that what is done, then quickly becomes an done, what is done is then undone. Joy was great, but it lasted just for a season and then it turns to pain, we see that there is a time for rejoicing, but that quickly gives way to a time of mourning. And there's really no value statement on these as in one is good and one is bad. All of these things happen. And they happen in a in a cycle a circle. So what's the point of doing this if we're automatically going to come back around?

Jeremy Sweets  17:56
I don't know if you saw the movie Groundhog Day, it's where an individual has to relive the same day, over and over. Do you ever feel like that? Did you feel like that? And this last year during the pandemic, I'm only to go to bed, get up? Do this, go to bed, get up, do the sack same thing. And there can be a frustration with it. Almost as if I'm not accomplishing anything, I can't check off this because I get up and I do the exact same thing again. And so I think this continues that that thought of time. And then it keeps going and that there is a frustration with that. So we ask what's the point? What's the point? And part of when we ask that question, part of what we're dealing with is that we would like to have control over the situation. But time tells us that that is limited. We'd like to accomplish something and say it's done, check it off, never to come to it again. But there is a limitation to what we can accomplish. And we love the idea of leaving leaving a legacy of being remembered having something solid foundational, but we realize that that is limited to and so when we ask the question from these standpoints, what is the point? If I can't have control? What is the point if if I'm not really accomplishing anything? What is the point if I can't leave a lasting legacy? And I think that's difficult to answer. If we look at time and look at what we accomplish by the standard at the end, then we're going to be disappointed if the point of life is to accomplish things to have control and to leave a legacy then ultimately We're going to be disappointed. So I think sometimes we simply want to get to our destination and see what is done what we can count on. But time renders a lot of that useless. I think what we need to do instead of seeing time as an obstacle that frustrates us that gets in our way that keeps us from having this enjoyment is we need to understand that time can be a teacher. You don't need to look at the end and say, What did I accomplish, what is lasting, what control that I have, but we need to appreciate the experiences that we have the beauty that we can find in those moments, learn from those, and learn from those in verse 11. I'll actually reverse nine through 13, I'll go ahead and read nine through 13. What game has the worker from his toil, I have seen the business that God has given to the children of man to be busy with, he has made everything beautiful or appropriate in its time. And he has put eternity into man's heart yet so that he cannot find out what God has done from the beginning to the end, I perceive that there is nothing better for them than to be joyful and to do as good as long as they live. Also, that everyone should eat and drink and take pleasure in all his toil. This is God's gift to man. And it's difficult, you know, normally, we want to take the Bible and run with it and preach it and go from there. But he's in the midst of trying to understand these things. So even if I read as I read this passage, I'm like, is this as pessimistic argument? Or is this something I need to hold on to? Well, notice that he says that God, he has put eternity into man's heart. But even when I read that statement, it's an encouraging statements. We are finite beings, but I think there is something in us that searches for something more. And that's been true of every civilization and culture. Now, they may not have known the true God, but they were searching, they worshipped something. They were longing for something. And I think there is an aspect to what God has done for us that causes that how we were amazed, God has put eternity in to man's heart.

Jeremy Sweets  22:30
But even as I read that, I noticed that that the preacher here, I think, sees a frustration in that. Because if we keep reading the verse, he says, also, he has put eternity in the man's heart, yet so that he cannot find out what God has done from the beginning to the end. And so you see the sense that the preacher says, There's eternity in man's heart, but there's also a veil, a limitation on mankind so that we know something's out there, but we can't know everything that God is doing. So even in this context, I think the preacher feels some frustration. And he says, I perceived, well, these three things. This is what I can can do. There's nothing better than to be joyful, and to do good, as long as they live. Also, that everyone should eat and drink and take pleasure in all his toil. This is God's gift to man. He's seeking meaning and purpose. And maybe we need to allow time to teach us instruct us use our experiences, our moments to find joy. That's great advice in the midst of this turmoil isn't this book that he's hashing over all this to do good. I think that's fantastic advice, whether I know where he's getting to the conclusion or not, I do think that's something we can hold on to, and to enjoy work. Sometimes it's not about what we can accomplish. Some tasks are more given to that checkmark than others. But it is good for us to work. There is something in humans that desires work, there is a fulfillment in doing and working. Sometimes we're so quick to say I want to retire. I want to be done. I want to be finished that we miss what time can teach us. And I think that's going to be a frustration if we're trying to jump to the end and say, What did I do? What control did I have? What accomplishment that I have? What What legacy Did I leave? So even if the preacher sees this statement with some pessimism, seeing that eternity is in our heart, but even then there is a veiled sense or a limitation. I think we see both aspects in verse 11. I think we can take this as something and something we see throughout the book that helps us find meaning. And that is meaning is not going to be found in this life in this world by itself. Meaning is something beyond us. And the eternity that we have in our hearts is necessary because it points us to what truly is lasting, what is stable, and that is what is found in God. So, let's consider so what? So what, what why are we talking about all these things? Well, first of all, when it comes to life, on earth, life on Earth, we need to know and understand that we are not in control, we are not in control. You know, we have illusions of control sometimes, you know, I think we, we feel a big sense of control. But But then we get reminded pretty quickly, right, we get a sickness, something we couldn't have prevented, we have no idea how we got it, or maybe it's something we inherited. And we're without control. Right? The weather comes through a tornado comes through, and we are not in control. Or we've decided we're going to start planning our family, you'll learn pretty quickly, you're not in control there, you don't get to pick necessarily all the winds, you don't get to pick the gender, you don't get to pick the personality, you think I'm going to be a great parent, I've got all this and then you get one of those personalities that puts you to the test. You're not in control. And we need to learn that about life. I think we kid ourselves. That is really a function of God, who is in control. We need to understand that we are not in control. We're talking this year about holding God's hand. And when we sing that song hold to God's unchanging hand. How does that start? Why is filled with Swift transition, not of Earth, unmoved can stain. Life is full of change. And we had better simply get used to that. If you're in a work environment, and you mentioned the word change, I think people start, you know,

Jeremy Sweets  27:25
sweat, sweating, they start getting upset, they get real stressed. And so it's just a scary thing. And I think we're all kind of like that. But it's important, we learned that we're not really in control. We also need to understand that when we're talking about time, time is limited. And while that can be a source of frustration, it can also be something that we realize that time is also precious, since it is limited, and we use it to the best of our ability. Yes, there's not as much as we'd like. But we use it to the best of our ability. Even though it is limited, it is still a gift that we have. In Colossians four, in verse five, it says walk in wisdom toward outsiders, making the best use of time. And so time should be cherished, and time should be used widely wisely. And we also need to understand when it comes to life on this earth, this world does not fulfill it amazed maybe I'm not amazed maybe that's not the right word. But the number of people that are hashing again, the same arguments of the preacher that are trying to find fulfilment in this life. And they say maybe it's through work. They spend their life work, they say maybe is for my hobbies, and they dedicate themselves to this. Maybe it's in my love life and they try to find someone and find fulfillment there. Maybe it's in my home. If I can just get a big enough one. Maybe it's in retirement work was tiring. I'm ready to be done. And maybe I can find fulfilment there. Maybe it's in pleasure. Maybe it's in sin, sin as much as you can just make yourself as happy as you can. Sheryl Crow said, All I want to do is have some fun, right? That's what this life is about. Maybe it's in money, if I can get enough wealth, and thank goodness, we're in a wealthy country because we can attain that American dream. I'm here to tell you that fulfillment does not come in this life. And as we read through Ecclesiastes, you know, some of these arguments I'm trying to understand the preacher was a much smarter guy than I am. I'm trying to understand exactly what he's saying. But I do know this and I think this is the conclusion We need to understand this life, life under the sun this world does not fulfill. Well, I think we also learned some things about God. While we are not in control, God is in control. God is in control in James chapter four, and that passes that quotes our life being a vapor. Notice what it says in verse 13. Come now you who say today or tomorrow, we will go into such a such a town and spend a year there and trade and make profit. Yet you do not know what tomorrow brain, what is your life for your image that appears for a little time and then vanishes away. You ought to say, if the Lord wills or wants it to happen, we will live and do this or that as it is you boast in your arrogance. Notice that you're not in control. Even when we say I'll meet you there at noon tomorrow. Our cars working weather's fine, we may have every intention. It may be though, that it is out of our control to meet that obligation. Because we're not in control, God is in control. And he has always been in control, He is the Creator. And he is the sustainer nations come into existence and power with his allowance. God is in control. God is in control. Permanence is found in God. We also see that permanence is found in God, we see that time is limited, we see part of our frustration with this life is it's so transitory, it's, it's so temporary, I built up this big business, and then it's run into the ground, or I devoted myself to, to retiring and then I get some kind of sickness after I devote myself to this, and then you know, I'm a professional weed puller, and they just come back up, they keep coming back up. We can't find permanence in this life. But guess what? Permanence is found in God. And Ecclesiastes three and verse 14, it says this, I perceive that whatever God does, endures forever.

Jeremy Sweets  32:26
What we do is temporary, our work is temporary, at best. But what God does is permanent. And we need to understand that message and learn that message. We all have this desire for this stability. We just need to know where to look for it. It's not in our work, it is in God, it is in God. And so with that in mind, we need to seek God and find purpose in him. purpose is not to be found in this life and the things of this life. But as we live this life, we can find purpose and meaning. And that's the conclusion in Ecclesiastes chapter 12. Fear God keep His commandments. After all this weighing in all this consideration and all the search for meaning. The conclusion is seek God and find purpose there. The song that we often sing says, Build your hope, on things eternal hold to God's unchanging hand. God wants us to seek him, I think, in part as we go back to that, Ecclesiastes three verse 11. That's why a turn at or a longing or desire for eternity has been put into our hearts. I think what we find in Ecclesiastes is natural that we have this search for meaning. And I think it's also important to understand that it's not to be found here it is to be found in God. It is to be found in God, hold to God's unchanging hand. That's a pretty important so what I'm sorry if majority of this lesson was depressing, but I hope it ends on a good note. This is exactly what the preacher had to endure and go through and think through and we can benefit from his knowledge. This is not a five quick, easy steps to lose weight or you know, five quick, easy steps to to a better life. Rather, this is an ordering of our entire thought process our entire worldview our entire lives. Now when they talk about diets and things, one of the keywords you'll hear a lot times you don't want to die and you want to make a lifestyle change. And so it is here, you can add a few pieces of knowledge and think Well, that'll fix everything. I can keep living how I want, but just add a few pieces of knowledge. Know God requires a lifestyle change. God requires that we would give him our all. And in that there has found meaning and purpose not because we will leave a legacy or we are lasting, but because we have found the only thing that is, and that is God. If you're here tonight and you're not a Christian, you have an opportunity to obey the gospel message, believing that Jesus is Christ repenting of your sins, confessing Jesus as the Christ and being baptized in the water for forgiveness of your sins. If you're here tonight, and you are a Christian, but you're not living as you should, you need to make a change. Remember what is truly important in this life. And the good thing is, we're a part of the Church here, and we can help one another get to heaven, we can pray for one another. So if you do need help in your spiritual walk, or you need prayers, you need strength than please reach out. Satan wants you to be isolated. But God wants you to be with his people so that we can help each other. If there's any subject to the invitation. Please come as we stand in scene at this time.
