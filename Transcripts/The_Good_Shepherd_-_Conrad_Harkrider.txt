It's great to be with you this morning if you want to open up your Bibles to Ezekiel the 34th chapter.

Conrad Harkrider  00:36
There are a number of images and pictures that are given in the scriptures to describe our relationship with God. He is a warrior he is one who goes out and fights for his people. He is a rock, a fortress, one that provides defense and protection. He is a king. He rules over his people in justice, and in righteousness. And he is a father, one who guides and helps his people, his children. But there's another image in the scriptures that I'd like for us to think about this morning. Our theme for this year in 2021, is holding God's hand. We want to have a better understanding a better appreciation for who God is. And as we think about his character, and our connection to him that produces a greater sense of reliance and trust in God, we can hold to God's hand, because he is the Good Shepherd. Perhaps the most well known reference to the Lord as a shepherd is found in Psalm 23. When David said, The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want. He makes me lie down in green pastures he leads me to stop beside quiet waters. David who himself was a shepherd says that the Lord is my shepherd. There is a personal connection there. The Lord is not just a shepherd, but he is our shepherd. We are His flock and his people. So I'd like for us to think about this special relationship this morning. And we're going to look at a wonderful passage from zekiel Chapter Thor 34. Begin reading with me in verse 11. Ezekiel 34, beginning in verse 11, it says, For thus says the Lord God, indeed I myself will search for my sheep, and seek them out as a shepherd seeks out his flock. On the day he is among his scattered sheep. So I will seek out my sheep and deliver them from all the places where they were scattered on a cloudy and dark day. And I will bring them out from the peoples and gather them from the countries and will bring them to their own land. I will feed them on the mountains of Israel, in the valleys and in all the inhabited places of the country. I will feed them in good pasture, and their fold shall be on the high mountains of Israel. There they shall lie down in a good fold and feed in rich pasture on the mountains of Israel. I will feed my flock, and I will make them lie down, says the Lord God, I will seek what was lost and bring back what was driven away, bind up the broken and strengthen what was sick, but I will destroy the fat and the strong and feed them in judgment.

Conrad Harkrider  04:18
And Ezekiel, chapter 34. There's this contrast between the leaders, those who are ruling over the children of Israel, they are contrasted with the good shepherd with the Lord. And in the first 10, verses the prophet is equal describes how the shepherd, the shepherds of Israel, those who were had authority over the people think about the civil leaders, the governors, the judges, the rulers. He describes how they were abusing their power. Look at verse four of what he says about the leaders of the people. He says in verse four is equal 30. For the week you have not strengthened, nor have you healed those who are sick nor bound up their broken nor brought back what was driven away, nor sought what was lost. But with force and cruelty, you have ruled them, they were using the sheep, benefiting themselves, preying on the most vulnerable. Sometimes, in order to appreciate the good shepherd, we have to see first see what a bad Shepherd looks like. And certainly, that's what was happening here with the leaders of the people. When I was a kid, we used to go to the rodeo every year, it would come into town. And I didn't grow up around farm animals, but I love to go and see all the different exhibits and shows and the competitions and everything that they would have. And one of the most interesting events at the rodeo was the steer wrestling. I don't know if you've ever seen this before, but a rider gets on his horse, and rides alongside the steer. And then while the horses running, he jumps off and grabs the steer literally by the horns. And the point is to try and flip this 600 pound animal over on to its back. The clock doesn't stop until all four feeds are up in the air. Sometimes the steer ends up on its back. Sometimes the cowboy ends up on his back. These shepherds of Israel were not trying to gently guide their sheep and lead them down the path that was most beneficial. They were forcing them, grabbing them by the neck, exerting their strength and their dominance over the people. It's one thing to do that when you're a cowboy and you're wrestling a steer, but for those who have been entrusted with the care and the responsibility of others, those who have been placed over the charge of another person, whether it be a husband, or a father, or a teacher, or an elder, there is no place for that type of harsh self serving behavior. But what we see in verses 11 through 16, is a contrast to that. God describes himself his attitude, his dealings with His people, He is the Good Shepherd. He doesn't tie a rope around the sheep. He doesn't force them to go in the direction that he wants. He doesn't drag them to do His will. But He guides them he leads them he helps them. He is the Good Shepherd. First of all, look at verse 11. It says For thus says the Lord God, indeed I myself will search for my sheep and seek them out. He is the Good Shepherd because he seeks out the last. Verse 11 says that he searches and he seeks for them. In verse 12, that word seek is used twice. And again in verse 16. Notice what he says I will seek what was lost and bring back what was driven away. Ezekiel was writing during the years of captivity, when God's people had been taken away from their homes. They were displaced. They were living under the rule and the oppression of these foreign captors. Many of them had been sold into slavery.

Conrad Harkrider  09:08
But now God's promises that He is going to bring his people back, he wouldn't allow them to just stay there. He hadn't forgotten about them. He wasn't going to forsake the promises that He had made to them. Instead, he was going to be faithful. In Zachariah, chapter 10 And verse nine. It says though, I scatter them among the peoples yet in distant lands, they will remember me, they they and their children will survive and they will return. I will bring them back from Egypt and gather them from a Syria I will bring them to gilliat and Lebanon and there will not be room enough for them. There's going to be this complete reversal. God's people who have been scattered are now going to be restored to the point that there won't be enough room in the land for them. Ultimately, that fulfillment of that promise would come in Jesus Christ. But notice who is doing the seeking here in verse 11. He says, I, myself, will search for the sheep. He's not sending out his messengers. He's not sending His servants. To do this. He says that I personally the Lord Himself, will go out and seek for his people. In Luke chapter 15, there's a parable that Jesus told about a shepherd, a shepherd who had responsibility over 100 sheep. And Jesus tells how almost all of the sheep were well taken care of. They were in the presence of their master, they were being provided for 99% of them. Were doing well. But there was one who was lost. And Jesus says that the shepherd would leave the 99, he would go in search of the one. He would search for it until he found it. Jesus said that His purpose and coming to the earth was to seek and to save the lost. The Good Shepherd is relentless in his pursuit. He doesn't look at the numbers and say, well, most are here. So that's good enough, he will continue to seek and to search after those who are lost about a week ago, we had one of those moments. I'm sure anyone who's a parent has experienced this, but we were at the store. And I was looking at all of the selection in the sporting aisle and enthralled with all the different options. And the next thing I know, I went over to another aisle to look at something else. And I turned around and I was missing one of the kids. I knew I had come to the store with two but now I only had one. So I went back to where I had previously been standing, and I couldn't find her. It was only a couple of minutes before we were able to find each other. But how long would I have continued to look? Is it conceivable to say that I would have just walked out of the store and said, Well, I guess I can't find her. So we might as well head back to the house. The Lord cares and loves each person that is living today, as if they were one of his children. He doesn't get sidetracked. With other things with other priorities. He doesn't grow tired. He doesn't forget how much he loves. Each of his children. He grew he he views every person from that perspective. Every person, your parents, your cousins, your neighbors, your co workers, the people in your community, they are either a part of his flock, or they are lost and if they are not included under his protection and guidance he is seeking after them. Do we view people around us people that we know people that we interact with? Do we view them in the same way that the Lord does? Do we see them as lost? And not just do we see them as lost? But do we seek after them?

Conrad Harkrider  14:07
Do we care about their lives their families about who they are? In First Timothy chapter one and verse 15. Paul wrote this saying is trustworthy and deserving of full acceptance that Christ Jesus came into the world to save sinners of whom I am the foremost Paul highlights a couple of truths here. That Jesus, His purpose in coming was to save those who are in sin. That was his goal, his mission but he also recognizes his own state. He says that I am a sinner I am the foremost of sinners. recognizing who we are, and understanding the Lord's desire for all people polls so important. He is the Good Shepherd because he seeks out the last. We can also hold to God's hand because notice what he says in verse 12. As a shepherd seeks out his flock on the day, he is among his scattered sheep. So I will seek out my sheep and deliver them from all the places where they were scattered on a cloudy and dark day. This is a shepherd who rescues the scattered. Not only does the Lord seek out those who are lost, but then he delivers them from their troubles. And notice the situation that they were in. He says they were scattered on a day of clouds and darkness. This was a very dark time for God's people. Their kings had been killed or captured. Their cities had been burned to the ground, their temple was in ruins. How could they possibly ever return and rebuild and be restored as a nation? Think about the book of Ezra. What is the first you remember how the book begins the first book, The first verse in the book of Ezra. It says, in the first year of Cyrus, king of Persia, that the word of the Lord by the mouth of Jeremiah might be fulfilled, the Lord stirred up the spirit of Cyrus king of Persia, so that he might say that he made a proclamation throughout all his kingdom and also put it in writing, he stirs up the king of Persia. What we see that this is not because the children of Israel were so strong, or because they had such a great plan to be able to bring themselves back into the land, but rather it was God who was working. God was active. He was working to allow his people to return. In Ezra chapter nine, in verse nine, it says, For we are slaves, yet our God has not forsaken us in our slavery, but as extended to us His steadfast love before the kings of Persia, to grant us some reviving to set up the house of our God to repair its ruins and to give us protection in Judea, and Jerusalem, the Lord wasn't just going to leave his people in slavery. But rather, he gave them favor in the Kings presence. When we were without hope, when we were in a desperate situation, far away from the Lord. That's when he came and rescued, that's when he delivered us from our troubles. When David had volunteered to fight Goliath, he was the only one that raised his hand and said, I am willing to go out. And when King Saul heard about that he brought David in before his presence, so that he could examine him. And after seeing David, he said, you are not able to go out and fight the Philistine because you are just a youth. And this man has been a warrior since the time of his youth. But in explaining to King Saul, why he was able and why he was ready to go out, he told him about the times when he watched over his father sheet, and how there would be moments of great danger when a lion or a bear would come and grab one of the lambs and start to carry it away from the flock. And David would grab it and strike it and deliver the animal from its mouth. The shepherd would provide deliverance from evil. It's one thing to be lost and not to know where you are. But have you ever been rescued from something?

Conrad Harkrider  19:03
Do we see our connection our relationship to God as one of rescue that He has delivered us? Back in 2008, there was a group of 12 boys on a soccer team. They had just finished their practice and they were going to explore some of the local caves that were close by to where they lived. And as they went into the cave system, it started to rain and there was a heavy rainstorm and the waters began to rise. And they rose inside the cave and outside of the cave to the point where the boys were trapped. The story got international attention, and all of a sudden there was 1000s of resources that were being put into helping to try and to solve this to to get these boys out. Over 100 divers participated in the rescue operation. And by an amazing feat they were able to rescue to bring them out alive. Sadly, there were two divers that lost their lives as a part of the dangerous mission. Our sin causes us to be separated from God we are stranded, cut off from his presence. If we stay in that state, eventually it will cause us to die spiritually. But thanks be to God that he does seek after us. He delivers us and rescues us. It wasn't just that God made our lives better. It's not that just He gives us a nice group of people to associate with and we can come and worship and get to know one another. But he gave his life so that we could be brought out of that cave of darkness. Romans chapter five and verse six says that we were still helpless. When we were without strength. That's when Christ died for the ungodly when he gave his life for us. You think those boys are close to the men who risked their lives in that rescue effort. You think they know their names? You think they remember their faces, there is a lifelong bond that is created when something like that happens. And in the same way, our whole life should be devoted in service and in gratitude and thanksgiving to the Lord because of what he's done. We hold to his hand because he is the one that rescued us, and delivered us from our sin. Also, notice verse 14. It says, I will feed them in good pasture, and their full shall be on the high mountains of Israel. There they shall lie down and in good fold, and feed and rich pasture on the mountains of Israel. We can hold to God's hand, because he is the good shepherd that provides for our needs. After seeking them out from danger, he brings them back to the land. He provides them food, he allows them to lie down, there's this sense of security and protection that he offers them. Sheep are not the smartest animals in the world. They have limited ability to defend themselves, they often get themselves in a bind, they fall down into a ditch or a ravine they are reliant upon the shepherd. And the picture here is that God does not bring us back and just leave us to fend for ourselves to face life and all of its difficulties and challenges on our own. But he continues to guide to protect, to help to strengthen it's similar to what David said in Psalm 23. He makes us to lie down in green pastures. He leads us beside those still waters. The Lord continues to provide for his people every step of the way. How does he do that? Well, one of the ways is through the body of Christ, through a group, a family of believers in Acts chapter four and verse 32. It says that those who believed were of one heart and one soul, that they had everything in common that there was not a needy person among them. Have you ever known of a Christian who has starved to death? Have you ever known of a Christian who has had to sleep out in the cold?

Conrad Harkrider  24:04
It's the exact opposite. When you become a part of the body of Christ, you're likely to gain weight, the love and the generosity and the kindness of God's people. When I was in college, there was a family that had sort of adopted me, taking me in, I was living on my own for the first time. And so they were doing what they could to try to help and support me. And I remember on Sunday nights after services, they would say, hey, why don't you come out to our car? We have something for you. And when I'd get out there, the wife would uncover this big bowl, a giant homemade bowl of banana pudding. Is banana pudding a fruit? When I was in college, the freshman 15 was a real thing. But when I think about that family, the Dickerson's. They had Three small boys. They had sports and work and other obligations. But they made a point to help out a young person who was living on their own for the very first time. In God's family, you will have people that you have never even met before. That will show you kindness and love that you cannot even imagine. The Shepherd provides for our needs. He looks out for his sheep, it is a blessing and a privilege to help those around us. And Hebrews chapter 13. In verse five, it says, Keep your life free from the love of money, and be content with what you have for he has said I will never leave you nor forsake you. And finally, he is the Good Shepherd, because He strengthens the weak. Look at verse 16. It says, I will seek what was lost and bring back what was driven away, bind up the broken, strengthen what was sick, but I will destroy the fat and the strong and feed them in judgment. His focus is on helping those who have the greatest need, the injured, the broken the sick. And notice what he's going to do to those who are fat and strong. He says that he will judge them, they will be destroyed, they will be fed with justice. We have a tendency to be attracted to those who are the most successful, those who are talented, who are educated, who are likable. If someone comes into our services, and they are dressed in nice clothes, and they look the part are they more likely to get attention from us. versus someone who is covered in tattoos and not dressed very nicely? Are we as willing to go up to them and talk with them? You see, the Good Shepherd is drawn to the outcast. He's drawn to those who are weak who have a spotted past. In Luke chapter five, in verse 31, Jesus answered them, those who are well have no need of a physician, but those who are sick, I have not come to call the righteous, but sinners to repentance. You see, the Lord cares about the ones who are sick, who have the struggles, the problems, the issues. The body of Christ is not just about building up those who are spiritually doing well who are on the right track. But rather looking out for those who are hurting. We can hold to God's hand. We can rely and depend upon Him because He provides us with strength. There are so many things in this life that can weigh us down. Worries about our health, worries about relationships, about finances, worrying about our children, we can start to feel overwhelmed by all the things that we face in this world. But we need to remember that God cares about us, like a shepherd cares for his sheep that he can provide us with strength. When we turn to him when we pray to Him, when we spend time meditating on his word, he can give us that sense of peace, that calm assurance, that no matter what happens in this world or this life,

Conrad Harkrider  28:54
that we are secure our future and our hope, are secure. In Psalm 59, verse 16, it says, but I will sing of your strength I will sing aloud of your steadfast love in the morning, for you have been to me a fortress and a refuge in the day of my distress. Even if our life is taken from us. We have a hope that goes beyond this world. We know who our Shepherd is. And we know where we are headed. In John chapter 10 And verse 11, Jesus said that I am the good shepherd, the good shepherd who cares for his sheep, he seeks out the lost. He rescues those who are scattered he provides for our needs. And even in times of great weakness and difficulty he can provide us with strength. Do you have those skills? Blessings this morning. Are you a part of His family? Are you a part of his flock? We're going to close with an invitation song. It's an opportunity for any who are here to respond to the Lord's invitation. There's something that we can do to encourage you in your walk to begin that relationship and that life, serving our good shepherd, please come down to the front as we stand and sing
