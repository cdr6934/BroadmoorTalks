Good evening it's good to see you. It has been a beautiful day is a good day for us be able to come back together to worship our God give Him thanks for all the good that he's done for us I'm not Jeremy Jeremy was posted police force a night but he he's not feeling well he's got a head cold and for some reason that keeps you from preaching I don't know if I understand that but that's what he says. So I know you're disappointed but of course I really know that you really come to here Jeremy speaker didn't come here to meet me speak you're here to you came to here to Word of God proclaim. And I trust that at least I will not stand in the way of you hearing God's word. I think as a speaker, God's word that's brilliant to be our our least our most important objective is not stand in the way people understanding God's word. He would turn to Matthew chapter six. When he texted me this morning, right before morning, Bubbles, morning worship. And asked if I can speak tonight this past this, this patch came to mind I recently was able to teach this material or teach a class on the Lord's Prayer recently and so I had that available. And so I thought we were looking at tonight the Lord's Prayer, as we find it over in Matthew chapter six.

Curtis Byers  01:26
Let's read this begin reading verse five, Matthew six.

Curtis Byers  01:34
She says when you pray, you must not be like the hypocrites, where they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and at the street corners, that they may be seen by others. Truly I say to you they have received their reward. But when you pray, go into your room and shut the door and pray to your Father who is the secret. your Father who sees in secret will reward you. When you pray, do not heap up empty phrases. As the Gentiles do for they think they will be heard. For their many words. Do not be like him. Your father knows what you need before you ask him. Pray they like this. Our Father in heaven, hallowed be your name. Your kingdom come your will be done on earth as in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our debts as we have also forgiven our debtors. Lead us not into temptation, but let us but deliver us from evil. For if you forgive others their trespasses, your heavenly Father will also forgive you. If you do not forgive others their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses. This is a very familiar passage of scripture I'm sure you know and probably even know the Lord's Prayer by heart. Whenever we look at a passage of Scripture, it's important for us to look at the context for which it is failing. And in the case of this passage to the media context is the Sermon on the Mount. Matthew, chapter five, through verse chapter seven. And this is kind of a little outline of service, for our purposes was sutas. The theme of the sermon amount, I believe it's the righteousness of the kingdom citizens. That's the overall theme. And it starts off with the Beatitudes, which tells us about the character of the kingdom citizens. And then we had the similar tools, where citizens are like salt, their light, like light. And then Jesus gives us His kingdom wall. He starts off with talking about the righteousness that exceeds remember. He said unless your question is exceeds that of the Pharisees and scribes and Pharisees, you will not be pleasing to God. And it gives us six examples where he says you have heard him say it but I say unto you, as examples of what he means by Russia succeeding that scribes and the Pharisees and then he goes into the section that contains the Lord's Prayer is a general categories of vices that is not to be seen. He follows that up with the sexual adoration is to be solved. And finally the righteousness to be practice.

Curtis Byers  04:30
So let's look at the beginning of chapter six. On the section Russians I'll be seeing the very first verse kind of serves as the thesis statement for for several things that he says here in chapter six. Be aware of practicing your righteousness before other people in order to be seen by them. Apparently in Jesus's day, there was the same problem we now have seen in rd as well. That is sometimes people do good just for the benefit of being seen to do good. They may or may not really be that in interested in doing the good itself, they may not really be interested in helping someone, but they are interested in being seen to be one who wants to help someone else. And Jesus says, Beware of practicing your righteousness before other people in order to be seen by the old is going to give us three examples. The first example is in the area of giving to those who are need almsgiving. When you give to the needy sound, no trumpet before you, as a hip Christian in the synagogue, and in the streets, he says that they have already received a reward. Because they rather when you give to the needy, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing. So that you're giving maybe in secret as your your Father who sees in secret will reward you will reward you period. And then we come to our section on the Lord's prayer that we just did. The verses we just read in Matthew six, verse five and through first eight, where he says when you pray, do not be like the hypocrites, because they love to say the synagogues and pray and on the street corners. He rather He says when you pray, go into your room and shut the door and pray to your Father goes in secret. And your Father who sees in secret will reward you. You see a theme developing right? Yes, one more thing that we're not to do. Verse seven, when you pray, do not heap up empty phrases as the Gentiles do. Or they think they will be heard by the many words. That expression if you phrases into the King James was rendered vain repetitions. Always have heard that described as talking about people who might just say the same words over and over again in their prayers uses very similar same terminology over in their prayers. I don't think that's exactly right. I don't think the Lord Moses using same words over and over. The question is, are we sincere in what we say? God is always interested in sincerity in our our is our heart into it. But we use the same words. In fact, you can see that that's the case. That's not his essence here because it goes on to say as the Gentiles do. How is it that the Gentiles use vain repetitions, we need to know something about polytheistic polytheistic idolatry. And in all the gods who made up the realm of the gods for the Romans and the Greeks. Their gods were notoriously capricious. They had their own problems, there had their own stuff they were dealing with, they couldn't be bothered by humans. And they could care really care less about humans. And so people who worship that kind of God felt like they had to say special phrases to get their God's attention. If they didn't get their attention on the first time, they said that they said it again. And they said it again. And they kept on saying it until he said it enough times. That that they thought that finally they got their attention to their God. And once they get their attention that then they could ask the God for help. That was the type of idolatry that was prevalent in the ancient world. And goddess, Jesus is saying, don't feel like you've got to use these multiple repetitions to get the attention. Why is that? Because he says there verse eight. Don't be like them for your Father knows what you need before you ask him. Isn't it great that we have a father who is interested in us? And he doesn't wait until we asked kale decide do we really need something here I noticed before we ask if we have need of something. We don't have to get his attention. He's anxious to give us his attention. And then the last example he gives in Matthew chapter six has to do with fasting. Moreover, when you fast do not be like the hypocrites have sad continents, for they just figure their faces that they may appear to meander fast again, they do this so they may appear on to me in too fast, really sad to you, they have the reward. But when you fast, fastest annoyed that hey warrants that face that you appeared not to me too fast. But onto the Father who is in secret in the father was a secret shall reward the opening word openly is not at all to transcend all the translations. But anyway.

Curtis Byers  09:28
So you have these three examples in the area of almsgiving, the area of prayer and area of fasting. The Jesus is concerned with what we are not to do. He gives examples of bad ways of giving to the needy, bad ways of praying and bad ways of fasting. So he's tried to correct those bad ways with the appropriate way. And so the Lord's prayer that we just read beginning of verse nine is His correction, his model factory so that's called this the model prayer is His His correction how we ought to pray. But let's, before we look at in detail this, go to Luke's account, Luke also gives us an A record of this model prayer. In Luke 11. Their text says that Jesus prayed in a certain place. And when he finished one of his disciples said to Him, Lord, teach us to pray, as John taught his disciples. He said to them, When you pray, say, Father, hallowed be your name, your kingdom code, Give us this day our daily bread, and forgive us our sins. For we treat, we ourselves forgive everyone who was indebted to us, and lead us not into temptation. It's very similar, but as you can know, it's good, as much shorter, as much shorter than Matthew's account. It occurs on a different occasion. In this occasion, we were told that Jesus was praying and some of his disciples saw him praying. And they asked Him, Jesus teach us to pray, For as in Matthew's account as part of a larger sermon that Jesus was giving. And that's very suggested to me, it seems to me, I can imagine that Jesus, on multiple occasions, would have given this instruction to His disciples of how to pray, very fundamental lesson that needed to be taught, probably to multiple different groups or multiple different occasions. It looks Luke's version we we have a gospel, we have a case where they asked him this question. And Matthew's gospel, he tells it in the context of a larger sermon with bigger lessons, other lessons being told, you know, the Gospel writers really had an impossible job. They had to tell the story of Jesus. In no more words that can be fitted on a scroll. Scroll, scroll scroll that day, and times are about 30 to 35 foot long, and the Gospel of Matthew and the gospel Luke and the Gospel of John typically would feel that the scroll of that link, they had to be very selective. Can you imagine all the things they could have told us all the miracles that Jesus did that we don't have record of all the things that Jesus said that we don't have record of? They had to be very selective. But both Luke and Matthew felt it important to record these words that Jesus gave this this model prayer, each using the giving us the portion they felt important for their purposes. As you compare these lists is most of the differences real quick, this kind of handles in our mind as we before we proceeding further, Matthew says Our Father who is in heaven he also as the startups praise Your will be done on earth, as in heaven and Luke does not record. They say this a little differently. Give us this day or each day, eating significant or everything. Matthew uses the word deaths Forgive us our debts. Luke uses the word forgiveness, our sin. Yeah, Matthews the case even down verse 14, verse 15, and Matthews account, he goes on and explains this by talking about that we are big others as so that we can be forgiven by God. So clearly, I think Matthew is intended us to tell us that Jesus is talking about sins and burst well. And then in verse 12, where it says, But deliver us from the evil that does not occur in lose. Again, Luke's is just a brief recount. Look at our things, get the record, many other things that Matthew doesn't record and so he was a little briefer his rendition. But let's go through this is this the last few verses really a commentary of Jesus Himself gives on his prayer. Let's go through and look at each of these expressions a little bit closer. First night, and pray then like this, our Father in heaven. But what explained to us as the Father is in heaven, surely that was a well known?

Curtis Byers  14:29
Well, Matthew puts more emphasis on heaven than any other writer in the Bible. word heaven occurs more times in Matthew than any other book of the Bible. There's something about heaven that was particularly attractive to Matthew. He uses the expression or in fact, we talked about the father of multiple occasions. He says, we talked about the Father He says our father either in heaven or our Father who is in heaven, or our Heavenly Father. He says that many times, all in one place Ellison in the Bible in the New Testament needs to be find that expression. And that's Luke says Heavenly Father on one occasion. So again, Matthew really love to talk about heaven. In verse a diversity and there you see where it says on earth as in heaven, earth and heaven are paired together as a as two opposites. Again, Matthew, more than any other writer makes that pairing between heaven and earth. And then, of course, the expression kingdom of heaven is the one that's well known. Matthew is almost exclusively uses that term not to totally exclude he uses kingdom of God on some occasions, but on many occasions, and most occasions use the term kingdom of heaven. For other gospel writers using expression KINGDOM OF GOD sort of suggested that he puts the emphasis upon Heaven is to highlight the fact that our father is a Universal Father. By being in heaven, he's above the Earth. He's, he's father, the overall there, he should be father of all on the earth. So perhaps that's the reason he puts an emphasis on heaven. I'm not sure there's others possibilities. Anyway, pray like this, our Father in heaven. Many have also noted that in this is prayer. The plurals are used the third person, plural, our father, he alair Later he says, They talks about us. He doesn't say my Father in heaven, but our Father in heaven. And I don't know exactly what that means. Maybe it simply means that we are to recognize that we're part of a community of people, that we're not the only child of God, but we're part of a larger family, who are part of God's family. And so by saying our Father, we're acknowledging that greater community I don't know exactly, if that's the reason or not, but it's certainly appropriate. Of course, Jesus is talking to probably multiple disciples and so in that sense, it makes sense to use our as well. And then we have these three petitions, hallowed be your name, your kingdom come your will be done on earth, as isn't Hello. The first thing I would like for you to notice is the punctuation. Notice that hallowed be your name, period, this is the English Standard Version I'm using I'll have your day period, your kingdom come comma, your will be done comma on Earth as is in heaven. As you're aware, no doubt, you know, the Greek text did not have any punctuation. Greeks did not use punctuation that was developed some point later in English is a common place for us to use punctuation, and punctuation as her understanding. So the punctuation that the interpreters have chosen, reflects their understanding of the passage. But understand that is their that's their understanding. So whenever you see punctuation in the scriptures, you ought to stop and say, does it make sense to you? Because if you look at other translations, there's different punctuations the New International Version, new Jerusalem Bible, a New American Bible say have it this way. Hallowed be your name, comma, your kingdom come comma, your will be done hover on earth as in heaven. And of course, our other translations, the King James American Standard, New Revised Standard New American Standard Bible, put periods hallowed be your name period, your kingdom come period, you will be done period or Scooby coma on Earth as in Heaven. How do those how does that punctuation assist released what direction does it point us in our understanding compared to maybe compare V and see examples using periods versus commas? We use a period to denote an end of a sentence and a sentence is supposed to be a complete thought right. So, you were by putting periods after hallowed be your name period Kingdom Cup period, and you will be done comma then a period after on earth as in heaven, it kind of gives the suggestion that those are independent thoughts. That Hallowed be Your name is one thought your kingdom calm is another thought your will be done or your will be done on earth as in heaven is another thought. Okay. Whereas the be example,

Curtis Byers  19:30
suggests that these are really all part of the same thought. Hello, have your name comma, your kingdom come comma, you will be done comma on earth as in heaven. And then ESV is kind of a kind of a combination of that. The first phrase is independent hallowed be your name, but the last two are part of the same thought your kingdom come your will be done. One question ask yourself what is it that has to be done on earth as it is? In Heaven, what exactly is peed on on Earth? As it is in heaven? Is it just the will of God that's to be done on earth? As it is in heaven? Or is God's kingdom to become to call on Earth? As is in heaven? Is God's name to be held on earth as it is in heaven? That's the question you have to answer, when you ask that question, and the punctuation will follow. I'm bitwixe. Between these, I like the ESV. But we don't think that's the proper way. I'm really not a big fan of the NIV. Do like New American Bible, but I kind of think a B is the way I see it more. Clearly, to me, these are all three parallel expressions. And all three of them are to be done on earth, as it is in heaven. That's my understanding of it. And some others gonna be I'm not unique in that by any means. But but some see it like, like see, that only the will of God via done on Earth only, that is only the will of God that has been to be done on earth as in heaven, the kingdom coming in that how you know God's name, or something totally different.

Curtis Byers  21:15
So I think that you can study this question and think about this and come up to your own conclusion of what punctuation should best reflect your understanding. Again, the text that we have is the interpreters understanding, when it comes to punctuation. The words are the words that you find in the Greek. Okay, so at least our English translation of them, we don't, we can't change, we can't tinker with those. But punctuation is something that we can think about. Right? And this is often the case, I often have found that one of the most helpful thing and comparing different translations is not so much to see what different words they used to see what different punctuation did they use. And sometimes that's very suggestive, I would encourage you to do that when you study. But let's think about the validity of this look at these expressions in in by themselves. And then maybe you can help us to decipher what we think the text is saying. Oh, by the way, there's a couple of other translations out there. There are there are there there is a debt Bible. She's very good translation. It has the commas, but it doesn't have a comma after you will be done. That's interesting. And just like that, there's also the Christian Standard Bible, which has the periods except doesn't have a common effort you will be done. And there is one that's totally out there. Revised English Bibles got a semicolon What are you gonna do with that? I don't know. I would never thought of a semicolon. Well, that's quite horrible. That's probably more appropriate in the cold but I don't know anyway

Curtis Byers  22:51
here's an alternate translations, whereas hallowed be your name. What does it mean about hallowed be your name Hello, is the King James Version word. We don't really use it very often, except perhaps when we're saying the Lord's Prayer. In the King James version, the word Hallo occurred many times in the Old Testament, not many times New Testament many times in the Old Testament, it was used as to translate the ideal holy. In our English translations, I don't know of any modern English translation that translated the word Hallo anywhere except for this location. And most that will still have retained that in this location. That a lot of the modern translations give homage to those passages that are well known and well, well loved. And, you know, Psalm 23, is one of those passages, the Lord's prayers when those passages they don't take her with it too much. Of course, some translations do, but a lot of them don't. So what does it mean to say hallowed be your name? Well, hallo is the same word that we also get the words wholly from. Now we don't have a past tense of the word holy. In Aryan language, holy, we don't have that. But we do have the past tense of the word sanctified, that wishes are equivalent term. st is the same word holy. So sanctified would be a verb form, as I'm kind of surprised that there aren't some translations that he says sanctified be Your name, that would have been appropriate, I think that would have been appropriate translation would have been that true. Gail or Evan, I think it would have been an appropriate translation. But you see also most translations add the word may in there may or may be hallowed. May your name be kept holy, or May your name be honored. I do think the word may gives us the correct sense. God's name is already holy, right. So we're not asking for God's name to be holy, in the abstract, you know, because it already this whole but what we are asking is that it may be recognized as holy, may have be treated as holy may be honored as holy, may be kept holy. I think that's what We're we're asking when we say hello be your name. And who we ask to be kept Holy Bible people on Earth, right? People on Earth. So again, that's why I think this it'd be totally appropriate to say hallowed be your name on earth as it is in heaven. I think it'd be totally appropriate to say that, because that's what we're asking, maybe kept holy baby otter is wholly on earth, as it is in heaven. Of course, what is the word holy mean? I've talked about this in previous time. So what was the labor this, but holy, remember, remember, it simply means to be set apart. And when we're asking for God's name, to be kept holy, that means we are, we are asking to keep God's set apart in our minds, to understand that he is not man. He is God, keep him in Israel, He is God, He is our Father, he is in heaven. He is set apart from us. And we are we are to be holy ones, we are to be saying this was that mean? We are to be set apart for God. We are to be set apart from the world. Right? Now people who are set apart ought to be good and just and wholesome, and kind and generous and loving. Those are characteristics that people who are holy should be, but to be holy, does take on those meanings, but rather simply takes on the meaning that we are set apart. We're different. God is different from us. Your kingdom called the New Living Translation as the word Su. I guess that's kind of implied that doesn't I don't know if it is really or not, but Your will be done. Again, New Living Translation yet as a word may or may or will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Your kingdom code or Mayer, Kingdom become be another way of saying that. Now, yes, people who are in the church are in the kingdom. So at one sense, it is appropriate to say that with the establishment of the church, you had you had you had a body of people on Earth who are now Kingdom citizens, so the kingdom had called to Earth. But God's kingdom had already been here, you guys in Old Testament talks about God's kingdom. Remember, God said He was the king over Israel, and they rejected Him, and they wanted a human king. But God's kingdom was already here. Right? I think this is broader, is being used in a broader sense of God's rule. And so when you're, when you're saying, Your kingdom come, we're saying, May your rule come on earth, as it is in heaven. God is clearly ruling in heaven. And God should rule an earth. What does it take for God to rule an earth? Well,

Curtis Byers  27:53
why isn't what we're asking here for I think, is that he's going to rule in the hearts and lives of men and women on earth. That we allow God's rule in our lives. I think that's what we're asking for God to do to become real in our lives. I believe that's, I believe that is, that's my understanding. Anyway, you may have different understanding, that's fine. I may be wrong. But that's my understanding that God that we're asking for God's rule, in the eyes of men and women, to manifest itself on Earth, as people submit themselves to God and His will. And that's why the Your will be done as a parallel phrase, your will be done on earth as in heaven. People who allow God's will to be done are those people who are part of that kingdom are allowed God's rules in place. Does that make sense? Hopefully, you get I don't want to stand in the way of proper understanding of this. If you think I'm wrong on that. Please talk to me. But that's my understanding of what I'm saying.

Curtis Byers  28:57
Then he says Give us this day, our daily bread is interesting. That word daily. You know, best we can tell. Matthew made that word up. He coined that word. Paul made up a lot of words, I make up a lot of words. I think that people make up a lot make up words, I just think that's the way it is. Nowhere else in Greek literature before this occurrence is that word daily occurred. And here's the dilemma with that when you don't have anything else to compare it to. It's hard to know exactly what it means. So you know, the scholars Look at this. There's different root words that it could be derived from, and it has different meanings. It could mean daily bread, exactly what our translations most of our translations say. Or it could mean our food for tomorrow. It could mean it could be tomorrow's food. It could mean that the footnote and New Revised Standard Version has that possibility. Or it could simply mean the food we need. And that's where the New Living Translation took it. So any one of those three are possible translations depend upon which root word it comes from. But again, the King James Version went with daily. So most translations modern translations have retained daily. I don't know if that's because they think that's the better translation. Are they simply doing that out of respect to the King James? I'm not sure. But they're all really saying the same thing to ours. We're asking God, to give us our food that we need. Now God knows our knees before we asked, which is what he said earlier, right. Why do we need to ask? Why do we need to ask God for our food this day? I don't know. I don't know if I know the answer to that, for sure. But it seems it does seem to me to make sense that is important for us to know, who gives us our daily food. Right, it's important for us to know that we need you and I need to understand that you and I are not the source of our daily food. The street that we have the buildings that we had, that allows us to work or somehow to provide for ourselves, the food that we have, is not because we're so good and so smart and so wonderful. As red is because our God is so good, and so wonderful. That's why we have our daily food. And we need to understand that. And what better way of reflecting that and ask God for it. Because he is the one who gives. There may be more to it than that. But seems to me that that's wrapped up in there somehow or another. So give us this day our daily bread

Curtis Byers  31:44
you know, I have never worried one day in my life about having bread for the day. In fact, I've been so that has been so foreign to my experience. My prayer is usually thank you Father, for the for this food, thank you for the food in the other things you have given me so but I usually looking at the rear, as opposed to looking forward. And I don't know if I should do that maybe I should be looking forward a little more. Because I never have had the I know that's not everybody's experience. I know there are people who have, who have not had your daily food. But my experience has never been a moment's thought. But But, but I always thank God for the blessings that He has given. And I know that he is the one who's given every good and perfect gift. I think I probably say that one phrase to be more often than any other from James, that God is the giver of every good and perfect gift that that raises finally one more deadly apprentice infinitely than any other that I can think of. I know that God has to give a very good gift. He's the giver of our health. He's a giver. Our strength is the giver of our families is a giver of our friends. He's the giver of this congregation. He is a source of everything. We need to know you know that to trust that you do. We need to always remember

Curtis Byers  33:16
rivers 12 and forgive us our debts as we have forgiven our debtors. Some of the modern translations have said things like scenes, or the wrongs that we have done, which I wish would be seen as everything. And I clearly think the debts under discussion here that I believe that Matthew is using the word debt as a metaphor for seeing. Perhaps you can see that in the parallel with Luke but I don't know if you really can't tell from one gospel writer exactly what other gospel writers meaning but you can by looking at Matthews guys going down a couple more verses. Jesus his own commentary says you only if you forgive those who sin against you, will your Father forgive your trespasses. So clearly the trust ideal sinner trespasses wasn't Jesus minor thing

Curtis Byers  34:09
is we said that Forgive us our debts as we have forgiven our debtors is the basis the basis of which we our sins are forgiven is not us forgiving others not. That's not the basis. The basis for the forgiveness of our sins is the sacrifice of Christ. Right. That's the basis that's the basis which Jesus God can forgive us our sin, sacrifice for Christ. What he's telling us here is the condition of our forgiveness. There's a condition this condition starts to get we have to repent and be baptized, right we have to we have to repent and be baptized for our sins be forgiven. There's also for for safety for giving us we have to be willing to forgive others the says that they might commit against us remember the remember the parable that Jesus gave where the one master had a servant who owed him A psalm that was so large that the servant could never pay it on. And yet the master was willing to forgive it. But then what did that that servant go and do? He would not forgive it a small debt of another person that owed him money. And Lord chastised him. Because unless you're willing to forgive others, their smaller debts, how can we expect God to forgive a large debt that we have against him? For our sins are great. But he's been willing to forgive us? Should we be willing to forgive others? We have to be willing to forgive others. There's no place for holding grudges, and God's kingdom, particularly not with other citizens of the kingdom, but with anybody whether they came around the kingdom. Don't purchase for us hold, we should not hold grudges. We should not we should not say, cherish up or store up in our heart, some small wrongs that somebody has done against us. Let's be charitable, as God has been charitable to us. I think all of us need that lesson from time to time.

Curtis Byers  36:19
Believes NO to temptation, but deliver us from evil. The last one is a little easier to deal with but livers from evil one is the way most translations translate that. I take it out to be the case. He's asking us to he's asking to help the Lord, Lord, help us to be delivered from Satan and evil. That's my understanding. The first one we're leaders not attempt to rotation is a little more challenging, I think. And the different translations kind of help you think of different ways. You're not bring us to the time of trial. You're not put us to the test. You don't subject us to the final test. Don't let us yield to temptation. Well, this is a harder and harder some ways. I believe that there's a dip I use the word test the word cementation differently. To me, the Lord test us just like he tested Abraham, just like he tested many people throughout scripture or test us. I believe he does that by simply giving us commands. He tells the Lord gives us the command is a test. Are we going to trust the Lord and and trust that he knows best and obey that or not? That's a test. A temptation is actually to me, the the, the trying to get someone to do evil. To Timpson, one is to try to get them to do evil. Thus, that's Satan's job. Right? That's Satan's job. He's tipping us all the time. He's like a roaring lion out there trying to see who he can devour. He's trying to tempt us. The Lord has not tipped us. Good. James. You know, he tips no one. Right? It takes no one to do evil. So, what does it mean? That is not to take too impatient? I kind of think New Living Translation may be on the right track versus don't let us yield to temptation. If temptation is the right, translation, the netlist is the best I can make of it. Help us not, Lord, help us not to yield to temptations in front of us. We as we are straight overcome the temptations of life. We have the one way of understanding seems to make sense to me. But deliver us from the evil one deliver us from the evil one who's tempting us. So those go together. Those make sense to me. Though New American Bible, that's the Catholic translation. I don't know if Catholic theology comes in this or not. But due to us objections to the final test, I understand that some people believe that there's going to be a final test. There's one big test out there at the end, that, you know, if you pass that test, then you're okay. If you don't pass that test, you're okay. And this idea of that final test seems to go along with that idea. I don't know if it's the best intent of that translation, but certainly go along with it. I don't know of any such thing like that in Scripture. I don't know of any such thing as there's one final test out there. We're tested every day. God has commanded us our God's commands are for us every day. And we every day we decide whether or not we are going to obey God's commands or not obey God's commandments, but we're going to pass the test or not. Sort of I don't exactly I kind of like the Living Translation maybe that's helpful to you the King James version as at the end of the prayer for that as the kingdom of the power the doors forever. I mean, if that's not original, you know, it would have been nice if it were because that's that's really powerful expression. But some trans some manuscripts have that in a text, but they're later manuscripts. Earlier manuscripts do not It's hard to judge exactly that question. But most likely this was not originally this was added at some point later on by some man. But it's certainly a true thought. It certainly is a true thought for that as the kingdom and the power and the glory forever. I mean, that's certainly a truthful way that we can save a farmer. And then he gives us this commentary for a Do you forgive others their trespasses your heavenly Father was forgive you if you did not forgive others their trespasses, neither will your Father forgive your trespasses. Luke concludes his model prayer with this section of scripture. Miller reading this, as he first says there's a parable. He said to them, this follows the model prayer in Luke that we just did a moment ago, he said, of the wish of you has a friend who has a friend will go to him at midnight and say to him, Friend, they'd be three loads. For a friend of mine has arrived on a journey, I have nothing to separate for you. He will answer from within, do not bother me, the doors now shut, my children are with me a bail, I cannot get up and give you anything. I tell you, though, he will not get up to give you anything, because he is your friend.

Curtis Byers  41:16
Yet, he will not give you anything because he is very yet because of the impedance. He will ride and give you he'll give him whatever he needs. So this is this always been a challenging, right in some ways. Is this trying to picture if this is a picture of God? I don't think it is. But if it were a picture of God, it kind of pictures God has been rigidly given. Again, we already been told that God knows our knees before we even asked. So I don't think that's the point. I think it's the next section helps clarify because there are says that tell you ask him to be given you seek and you will not find not going to be open to you. For everyone who asked to see even the one who seeks finds, the one who knocks it will be open. That's what God does. The God when you ask God answers for you knock, he opens. What father among you, if his son asked for a fish blue instead of a fish, give him a serpent? Or if he asked for his egg will give him a scorpion. If you then who are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children. How much more will help you Father give the Holy Spirit to those who asked him. I think the in the previous verses were the friend is just a human who's who's regretfully will give. Well, if if a human will be grudgingly give, the Lord will anxiously give just like the father, a father, no father would no father would would give a certain Scorpion instead of a loaf and equity. No father would give a serpent instead of fish. Right? So just as your Father is it? Is it a perfect picture of God? The friend is an imperfect picture of God. They just kind of points the direction how God has been greater than all that better than these are seems to be the case. Well, that's all I really have to say. And I hope that was of some help to you as we reflect on this passage of Scripture. This is a wonderful passage, one that we should take to heart. Maybe it'll help us in our old prayer life. Let's remember that God knows our knees. Let's ask him a spanking. There's one thing you might look at this prayer. There are some things that that does not include like it doesn't have petitions for others. There's no supplications for others involved in their prayer. Jesus prayed for his disciples, Paul prayed for various churches, surely we are to pray for others. So it's not a complete Ma is not a complete template for our praying. But it is a powerful tool. That helps us I think is we tried to go to our father and conference as we played him. There is any here that I who are in any way subject to invitation, we encourage you to come and accept those invitation. But we stayed in seeing the songs
