It's always a privilege and an opportunity and an honor to get a chance to come together and worship and praise our God in heaven. We don't take that lightly. And we are, we're making our way through this pandemic, hopefully winding down. And we'll be able to get rid of our mask before too long. But the meantime, we still continue, we still get together to worship and praise our God to give him the praise and the honor that is due His holy name. So it's a great, great opportunity that we have today to come together especially to remember the sacrifice of Jesus Christ is suffering, His death, His resurrection, all of that, remembering what he did for me and empowers us to do the things that God wants us to do in his kingdom appreciate the songs that Gil led for us this morning. As he addressed the issue of compassion. One of the most well known parables that Jesus spoke is in Luke chapter 10, the parable of the Good Samaritan. And I want to suggest that even though this is a very well known passage, that his message is in meaning is as relevant today as when Jesus spoke it 2000 years ago. So in Luke chapter 10, if you have your Bibles weren't might want to turn there, and I'll be having this up on the screen as well. But in Luke chapter 10, we have this account of really life changing teaching, that Jesus wants us to partake of in our lives and our example. And so I want to suggest this morning, that this is what I call essential Kingdom teaching. When Jesus addressed the issue of compassion, this is of paramount importance to him. And it should be to us as well. So elu chapter 10, with a bit texture in just a moment. But it shows us the heart of Jesus. And it shows us the kind of heart that He wants us to have his his followers. And this is my favorite kind of preaching through the years if I just read the text and study the text, and and look at what the application was to the original hearers. And then look at the application to you and to me. And so that's what we want to do this morning, is look at this well known passage in Luke chapter 10. And get this to advance if this was advancing. Or maybe it's this other clicker. Try this one here. Yeah. So we'll be looking at this. The Samaritan and suggesting by way of subtitle that he had a heart of compassion was set him apart from so many people in the state, especially from the Jewish establishment, the religious leaders, the priest, the scribes, the Pharisees, all those types of people. And so again, this is, this is essential Kingdom teaching. And we may be asked the question, why do we sometimes call him the Good Samaritan? Well, I think it's because he demonstrated a heart of compassion. That's what that's why we put that label on him. And the parable is told to us and this is familiar passes to I'm sure to all of us, but the perils told to us so that we would imitate the Samaritans goodness, which is having a heart of compassion. And for the brethren here, Broadmoor as we all know, we're thankful to have so many compassionate and merciful and caring Christians meeting the needs of so many others.

Mike Roy  03:40
We that's our task as Christians to be the kind of compassionate people that that God wants us to be back I was thinking because I was preparing this lesson. So oftentimes we have because of our location homeless people come by and we've all at different times tried to assist them and help them bring them food one time a few years ago, our been praying for Kevin Stinson in his recovery, he kind of took the lead in providing a place for this man who was looking for for shelter, getting a hotel and getting others to assist in that process. So in preaching want to make sure we understand that, that we we are people who practice compassion, sometimes we think that the preacher or the Bible class teacher, or the elder is saying things that we know, show our shortcomings but the truth is to brevan abroad more here are quite compassionate. And that's the quality that God wants us to to imitate in our own lives. And so we're gonna be looking at in Luke chapter 10. And this very well known passage and what kind of spurred this lesson I've just begun to read a book called a life beyond the beyond amazing. And in one of the chapters is talking about this Samaritan. And so by way of preview, these are the things that I hope that we can see as we look at this text this morning. they'll highlight those on the on the screen this morning. But this good samaritan shows us that compassion is an abstract that is concrete that it has. It makes application to people's lives. It shows us that compassion isn't afraid. It shows us that compassion doesn't analyze, it's not analytical. It shows us that compassion can sometimes surprise you. And that's one of the messages of the this parable that the most compassionate person was when least expected to be. We expect the priests to leave by certainly not the the

Mike Roy  05:39
Samaritan. And compare this, this parable shows us that compassion is about what you see, and also about what you do. So So I want you to be thinking about those and they'll come to the surface, as we go through this text, I'm going to put the text upon the screen. And then again, look at what this discussion is all about, and find out what this message meant to the first hearers, especially to the lawyer, because he is the object of this message. And then for the Jewish people in general. So here's the text. Let's look at verses 25 feet 29. This is kind of the backdrop for the the message that Jesus gives in terms of this, the parable of the what we call the Good Samaritan. So it says, Behold, this the ESV behold, a lawyer stood up to test him, or put him to the test thing, Teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life? He said him what is written in the law? How do you read it? And he answered, You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your soul, and with all your strength with all your mind in your neighbor as yourself. And he said to him, you have answered correctly do this, and you will live. But he desiring to justify himself said to Jesus, and who was my neighbor, so look at this context over here, and just going to highlight a few things. So the man who stands up to test Jesus is a lawyer. And he's not a lawyer in the sense that we have lawyers today and Mark Hudson, or my son in law, Matt, up in Chicago with Hannah, but a lawyer in the New Testament would have been an expert in the law of Moses. He was a he had superior knowledge and experience. He's one who taught the law, he explained the law, he might have interpreted the law, but he was an expert. So this expert in the Jewish system comes up to Jesus. And notice, also they they put him to the test. So my question is, is this man's sincere? Is he genuine? Or is he disingenuous? He, I mean, this, again, is just not an average Jew. This was a man who was an expert and the Law of Moses. And he's coming to Jesus. And text tells us that he's a, he's putting him to the test, maybe trying to trap him, perhaps he is going to try to contradict Jesus with the Jewish law or the Jewish traditions. So this is the context over here. So the lawyer stands up kind of confronts Jesus puts him to the test and asked me that question, what's, what do I have to do to get eternal life? That was the common question in the Jewish realm? And I think he gave the right answer, but less than what Jesus said. He said, what's written in the law? And how do you read it? What does it mean to you? So he turned the question on the lawyers head? Because that's what the lawyers do the biblical lawyer, an expert in the law, he would he would know what the law says. And he would have to interpret this. So Jesus says, What's the law say? And how does it read to you? So he turned the tables on this man who was an expert in the law of Moses. And so,

Mike Roy  09:00
again, I think this is language alluding to his work as a lawyer, there's three brief observations I want to share from Burton Kaufman and his commentary of just about this section right here. Number one, the way to eternal life is through the word of God. It's not through tradition. It's not through religious heritage, the way to eternal life is what does God's Word say? And I continue to try to teach my mom and grounded her and the truth is she continues to discover a biblical truth and shares those truths with other family members where, for example, Matthew, chapter 23, Jesus says, Call no man father, she's recently come under the wrath of a sister who was so infuriated that she would not do that anymore. But the point is, he says, All I'm trying to do is follow the Bible. And so what what Jesus is telling us here is that number one, the way to find eternal life is in the Word of God. And then secondly, I think This implication from coffin is applicable. He said that every man is responsible for reading and obeying the Word of God. So when he says, what's written into law, and how do you read it, he's saying, you have to read the Word of God, you want to go to heaven, you want to have eternal life, you have to know what God is saying, You don't have to rely on preachers or pastors or religious leaders. So secondly, I think the implication is valid that every person, that's you and me, every person is responsible to read the Word of God, and to know it, and to do it. And then thirdly, I think, another valid implication from this little section right here, is it the Word of God gives the same answer to every person seeking eternal life. And for one person seeking eternal life. God doesn't say, Well, you pray six times a day, and for you best twice a month, if you repeatedly baptize them for you, just don't just save as soon as prayer. No, when you study the Word of God about the question of salvation and obtaining eternal life, the answer is the same for every body. Valid point, I think that's what he's saying over here. So that's just a little brief comment on this, this section over here. So this looking at this text that we get here up on the screen, so here's this lawyer, expert, in the Law of Moses, is putting Jesus to the test. Jesus said in he wants to know How do I inherit eternal life? And when Jesus said, you know, what is what is the laws mean to you said, you can he said, You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, all your soul, all your strength, all your mind, and your neighbor as yourself. And Jesus said, you've answered correctly do this, you will have CASE CLOSED stories over. No more discussion, he asked me to correctly do this, and you will live. He knew exactly what the law said. He quoted it verbatim. He knew how to get eternal life. But what happens? Oh, but he desiring to justify himself? He wasn't. He was an expert in the law of Moses. But he really wasn't keeping it. Maybe didn't have an intention to keep it. Say when it says that, but desiring to just by himself, said that Jesus, who was my neighbor? Come on. This is the expert in the law of Moses. And he said, who was my neighbor? It was a, it was an excuse. Again, he's just trying to justify himself, he knew that he was falling short of God's law. But that's not a difficult theological question. He knew who his neighbor was, he knew what the law said to love your neighbor as yourself and knew he knew that we would take care of the homeless, they want to take care of the stranger, and the sojourn and all of that. But again, it's this reveals that this man to me is disingenuous. Perhaps he's hypocritical. And when I first started working on this lesson, I really was focusing on this idea that this is total hypocrisy, maybe it's not. But here's the situation where this this lawyer knew what the law said. He was charged with teaching it. And and yet he's, he's one, he was not willing to do it. And essentially, when you look at Jesus most, most scathing rebuke of the Pharisees and scribes and lawyers have found in Matthew chapter 23, and Luke chapter 11, the people who should have known better simply, were not willing to do that, and and there was a level of hypocrisy, it may not be in this particular case with this particular lawyer. Anyway, so this is his question. And so then Jesus

Mike Roy  13:57
answers this question by telling the story. So in verse 13, Jesus replied, He said, A man was going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, and fell among robbers, who stripped them and beat him, and departed, leaving him half dead. Now, by chance, a priest was going down that road, and when you saw him, he passed by on the other side. So likewise, a Levite, when he came to the place and saw him pass by on the other side, but as Samaritan, as he journeyed, came to where he was, when he saw him, he had compassion. He went to him and bound up his wounds, pouring on oil and wine. Then he set him on his own animal and brought him to an end and took care of him. And the next day, he took out to dinner Rei and gave them to the innkeeper, saying, Take care of him. And whatever more you spend, I'll repay you. And I come back in verse 36. Which of these three do you think proved to be a neighbor to the one who had fell among the robbers he said, The one who showed him mercy and Jesus To set him go and do likewise. So look at this, this context over here, first of all in verse 30. Just as we go through this quickly, in this story that Jesus is trying to illustrate, what does it mean to be a neighbor? How would a good neighbor respond? And how is that shown? It says that a man's going down from Jerusalem to Jericho, he fell among robbers hate they who stripped him and beat him and departed, leaving him half dead. So just from a geographical standpoint, his reminder, the road from Jerusalem to Jericho dropped about, I think, 3200 feet over 18 Miles 15 to 18. Pretty good drug. So So Jerusalem's up here, and Jericho is down here, it's about a 3000 foot descent. And it's a long, apparently, treacherous road rocks, a lot of hiding areas where robbers could hang out there. And so in this story, this man is on this journey of probably made, apparently a Jew. And he's these robbers come out from behind the rocks of the trees in the hills, and they attack this man, because this is a parable. And they to the point of robbing him, and then leaving him almost to the point of death. And so when he and his the story unfolds, to give instruction to this lawyer, of what it means to be a neighbor, and the context that says now in this scenario is by chance, is it a priest was going down that road. So it gets reminded that we all have opportunities, by chance you come upon somebody, or here have a situation where brother and sister in Christ has a has a need, and we look into that, but by chance, this priest comes down the road, who was the priest again, the priests was a descendant of Aaron, who is one who is devoted to the service of God in his fellow man, he served in the temple, offered sacrifices, again, the priest knew the law knew what God expected of him. And he was one who claimed to follow the law. So of all people is coming down the road, and you see a fellow is your life, perhaps robbed and beaten, left for half dead, surely the priest to be the first one to help. But the text says that a priest was going down that road when he saw him, I take that from the even the text to the Greek construction, there wasn't just like, he saw somebody over there, and he kept, but it can't, he looked over there, he saw him saw the man in his situation, and the man is half dead. And it says he passed by, on the other side, said, no compassion for this fellow human being who's bleeding to death. And this story. So here's the first man sees what's going on. He saw the the individual passed by on the other side, then again, a Levite, who is a Levite. Well, Levi was an assistant to the priest, he served in various capacities and maybe transporting the tabernacle. But he was an assistant to the priests, he also knew the law, he would be a good Jew, he certainly knew what was expected of him. So again, a Levite was like a super religious leader. He knew what God expected of him in terms of loving his neighbor helping the sick, all those things. So likewise, a Levite when it came to the place, and he saw him so again, the same language over here

Mike Roy  18:40
that he saw this individual, he passed by on the other side, as I was mentioning, at the beginning of this lesson, that compassion isn't abstract, it's real. It has application and compassion isn't afraid. Compassion isn't afraid to look into a situation, sometimes we're afraid. We see a situation something going on, and we're just I don't want to get involved. I don't want to have to do invest my time or my money or whatever. I don't want to know what's going on here. But compassion, isn't afraid. That's the nature of biblical confession is not afraid to help to investigate. So here's a man, the the second individual, the Levite, he knew better. He knew the law of God of all the people, and who come across a man who has been robbed and beaten and left for half dead. The priest and the Levite would be the first ones that you would think would help. But again, the context in Jesus's teaching this lawyer lesson, is it But a Samaritan a Samaritans coming down the road, a priest has already passed by a Libra has already passed by now a Samaritan has come along, come down the road and remember that Samaritans worse severely despised by the Jews in fact, and and John Chapter Four forces that they have the Jews have no dealings with the Samaritans. And and so again, there was such open hostility. So I understand the origin of the Samaritan people.

Mike Roy  20:13
Following the time of the captivity, some of these Jews did not go into Babylon. They were left bear, and they and many of them and ended up in a marry with the Gentiles were the Hebrew people. So it was kind of a mixed race. And anyway, they were so they would, they would just I don't leave despised by the Jewish people and throughout history, and even in Jesus day, but Jesus says in the story, this Samaritan is he journeyed came to where he was. And when he saw him, he had compassion. So here's a man who practice truly religion. And he may not have had all the formal training like the priest and a Levite. Good, but he's the one who did what was a person should do the compassionate thing, and helping somebody who isn't in a place of need. So against reminders, we go through this lesson, that compassion is an analytical, we don't just have a one to one of the persons worthy of my help. I want if I should get involved his brother over here, the sister and cry, so compassion doesn't analyze so this man spontaneously and compassionately sees the individual Rob beaten left for half dead, and he skates off his donkey and goes over to check it out. And look at what the text says over here. So so the went to him in bound up his wounds pouring on oil and why was he ever traveling Red Cross packet in his you know, donkey, if you have some kind of a safety situation there, perhaps is some writers have said that he bound up his wounds by taking off some his shirt and tearing it up and making a tourniquet or whatever. So he may have bound up his wounds with his own clothes, getting him all obviously bloody and ruined, forever, be poured on oil, maybe his own oil lady had for his own medicinal needs. And as a soothing substance, pour that on this man, the wine wish would have been his drink. And he's carrying with him maybe he poured the wine on his as an antiseptic. So he's totally giving of himself to this individual who is hurting, while the priest and Alibhai just hardened their heart and marched down the road, they don't want to get involved. So after he does all this, he gets off. He's on. He's on a journey from Jerusalem to Jericho. And he gets off his animal. And then he helps this man. Then it says, And he said him on his own animal and brought him to an end and took care of him. Again, there's lots of questions here about how this all takes place. But now he he gets off his donkey puts this wounded person on his own beast, his own animal, and takes them to an end. And then he took care of them there. And then it says, And the next day, so how much time has elapsed, this man has given up, you know, a day or two of his life so far. And the next day he took out to dinner, he i That's a denarii. I was, I believe, one day's wage. So he took out two days of his wages. And he went to the innkeeper, and said, Take care of him. So he's already helped the man out tremendously save this life. Take care of him. And whatever more you spend, when I get back from my business, I'll pay you. It's remarkable. Totally remarkable. That what this man did total selflessness, total compassion, and of all people in the account that Jesus is telling, He's the least likely that we would think in our minds to do this type of thing. That's why we might say compassion may surprise you, or are we surprised by his compassion?

Mike Roy  24:12
I think what we have over here that what's so shocking in this story, is that the to religious leaders who knew the word of God, they knew the law of God, they knew what they were supposed to do, they turn away but again, by sharp contrast, the one individual who is so despised by his religion, his culture, especially by the Jews, he's the one who jumps in there to help and to help out this man. So again, this remarkable story is one that we're very familiar with. But it's against a reminder for us to think in terms of what compassion is all about. It's not abstract. It's not afraid. Compassion doesn't, isn't analytical, but compassion is about what what you see in what you do. So all Free these people, the priest, the Levite. And the Samaritan, all saw the man who was bloodied and beaten. But really, the only one who had eyes of compassion, of course, was the Samaritan. So compassion is about in this text, what you see and what you do. And so, as Jesus comes back to the lawyer, he's in this dialog. He said, Which of these three do you think proved to be a neighbor to demand who fell among the robbers? And so the response of the lawyer, he said, the one the one who showed him mercy, anything striking to you about that? So here, Jesus tells us compelling moving story about this Samaritan, who is so compassionate, so merciful, does everything to help this wounded, hurting individual. But it's interesting that this lawyer can't even say the word Samaritan.

Mike Roy  25:54
Again, is it a level of prejudice that is so deeply seated, that he can't even bring himself to say, the Samaritan did that he said, Oh, the one that the one who was merciful. And so Jesus says, Go and do likewise. And so this, again, is a is a compelling passage of scripture that most we're familiar with. Again, it's intended to teach us what it means to be people of God, people who are compassionate, who want to help those who are in need. And so again, as you think about the things that we looked at this morning, the Good Samaritan shows us that compassion isn't some abstract term love, and mercy aren't just abstract terms. They're real. And they have feet, and they have arms, and they take action. Compassion isn't afraid. If I'm afraid to help somebody out, maybe I don't, I don't have the level of compassion that I should have. Compassion doesn't analyze. Compassion can surprise you. Compassion is about what you see. Compassion is about what you do. And I think it's a reminder to us that knowing the law of God is meaningless unless we do what God tells us to do that God and God does command all of us, to love our enemy to assist those who are in need. Jesus expects us to be compassionate Christians. And so as we wrap up the lesson this morning and sing the invitation song, this is a question that each of us have to ask ourselves, do I have a heart of compassion? And we can say I can quote certain books of the Bible, I can quote, you know, this, and that. And I've studied Hebrew, and I know some Greek and all that kind of stuff. And my daddy was a preacher, my grandfather was an elder or what whatever the situation might be. The question is, Do I have a heart of compassion? And the people in this account, the priest, and Levi, who should have known better, they're the ones who were lacking in compassion, and the one that we would not expect? In some ways? He's the one who illustrated what compassion is all about. So that's the question I leave for you and for me, do I have a heart of compassion? Do I view any person in need as my neighbor, and in the end, we go back to the Word of God, you know, God has revealed his will to us. He tells us how to how to inherit eternal life. And in terms of, of salvation certainly have to obey the gospel. We have to believe that Jesus is the Messiah, we must repent of our sins, I must confess our faith in Him must be baptized for the forgiveness of our sins. But we've got to be people of compassion. In Matthew chapter 25, when Jesus gives a picture of that judgment day about who's going to heaven and who's not, and who's going to be cast into hell is the one who fed the hungry, and clothe the naked, and sheltered the homeless. So again, this reminder that we're not justified by our works, but God wants us to be people of compassion, who pour that out into the lives of other people. So hopefully the lesson is an encouragement to you is it is to me if there's someone here this morning who needs to obey the gospel of Christ. Certainly, God wants us to be compassionate, but we have to obey His well. God has revealed how we get eternal life. It's through faith in his son repenting of our sins. Yes, confessing that before others and being baptized to have our sins forgiven that there any of this morning who needs to respond to the invitation. We invite you to come forward while we stand and sing this invitation song
