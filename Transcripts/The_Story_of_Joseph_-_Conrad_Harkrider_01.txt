One of the aspects that I really love about technology is the fact that we can take a picture at any moment. Anything that you want to capture, you just pull out your phone, and you snap a pic. And then you have that memory saved. We have literally 1000s of pictures on our phones, most of them are of the kids, but not all of them. The other day, I was looking through some of my pictures, and there was a string of about 20 of just random toys throughout the house. So sometimes the phone or the device gets in the hands of someone else, and they decide to take whatever pictures that they're they're looking for. But you can capture those incredible memories. Have you ever seen a picture of someone, they take one of their kids, and they put it side by side with a picture of themselves maybe when they were that same age? What's the point of doing that it's to be able to see the similarities. To look at the resemblance You look exactly like your Mommy or you have the same cheesy grin as your daddy. And we can notice and compare between our children and our parents. In the Bible, there are a lot of similarities and comparisons between the Old Testament and the New Testament we call those shadows or looking ahead, something that is being foretold of. And one of the best ways to see Jesus is to look back at some of those shadows at some of those comparisons. To gain a better perspective, a better view of who Jesus really is. This year, our theme at Broadmoor has been seeing Jesus, we want to gain a clearer understanding a better picture of who he is and what it means to be one of His followers, one of his disciples. And so what I'd like to do this morning is just put one of those pictures side by side with Jesus look at one of these Old Testament characters. And look at some of the comparisons that this individual has with Jesus to gain a better and a clearer picture of the life and ministry of our Lord. So I'd like to think about seeing Jesus in the story of Joseph Read with me in Genesis chapter 37, beginning in verse three, Genesis 37, beginning in verse three. Now, Israel loved Joseph more than all his children, because he was the son of his old age. Also, he made him a tunic of many colors. But when his brothers saw that their father loved him, more than all his brothers, they hated him and could not speak peaceably to him.

Conrad Harkrider  03:15
The similarities between Jesus and Joseph are striking, one writer said that they he found over 75 Different occurrences or events or traits between these two men. I'm not going to try to go through all 75. But we're going to look at four different qualities or characteristics between Joseph and Jesus. First of all, notice here from Genesis 37, that Joseph has a complicated family dynamic, a complicated family dynamic and verse three, it says that Joseph was the son of Jacob's old age. And that's one of the reasons why Jacob loved him so much. But it wasn't only Jacob, who was old who was past his prime years, you remember that Rebecca had a lot of trouble getting pregnant, she was buried, and for many years, she had tried and without success, to have a child. And that hardship of course led to the competition between her and her sister Leah, as they tried to gain status by having children in this great baby race that they engaged in. They gave their handmaid's to their husband. But after 10 sons and one daughter, still, Rachel had not born a child. But finally the Lord opens her womb, and she's able to get pregnant. So the birth of Joseph was somewhat of a surprise, a shock to his family. His father is old, his mother has been barren, and yet now, they're going to have this child of course that reminds us, and sounds very familiar, doesn't it in the story of Christ, Mary, and Joseph became pregnant Mary became pregnant by the most improbable way being a virgin. They were not yet married. And yet they found out that they were going to have this baby. In both instances, God was working in the lives of these families. But Jacob loved Joseph. In fact, verse four says that Jacob loved him more than all of his other sons. He was the beloved son of his father, he was the favorite son, I have one of those. A favorite son, he is my only son. But when parents show preference or give special attention to one child, over the others, it is sure to cause complicated family dynamics. And in this case, Jacob wasn't being subtle about his feelings. He gave Joseph this very ornate, colorful robe, assign a clear sign of distinction, and honor. And so his brothers began to hate him. They were jealous of the love that their father had given to him. If you ever had a sibling that you didn't get along with. You ever had one that you were always arguing with? getting in fights, they were taking things from your room, constantly saying things that bothered you? I'm sure that's never happened to anyone here. No, of course, that's pretty common in families. I know that. Growing up being the youngest of three boys, I did my fair share of pestering and causing trouble. But I don't think it ever got to the point where my brothers hated me so much. They wanted to kill me. And yet, that's what this has degraded to in the life of Joseph hit his brothers are looking for an opportunity to take his life. But it wasn't just the code that Joseph received. Joseph was given something else, some special gift from the Lord that caused him to be despised by his brothers. Look at Verse five, chapter 37. In verse five, it says, Now Joseph had a dream. And he told it to his brothers, and they hated him. Even more looked out in verse 11. And his brothers envied him. But his father's kept the matter in mind. And then in verse 18, it says, Now when they saw him afar off, even before he came near, they conspired against him, to kill him. Joseph's brothers

Conrad Harkrider  07:54
hear about these dreams that he has. And these are not dreams that Joseph came up with himself. This is not something that Joseph invented. It wasn't something that he decided but rather he was just relaying what he had seen. He was telling those around him the things that had been given to him by God and they despised him for it, they were jealous. And ultimately, they conspired and came up with a plan to kill him. In the Gospel account, we are given a few details about the family of the Lord. And in Mark chapter 31. In verse 20, Mark chapter three and verse 21, it says, And when his family heard it, they went out to sees him for they were saying, he is out of his mind. He's crazy. In John chapter seven, in verse five, it says, For not even his brothers believed in him. Joseph and Jesus were rejected by those who were closest to them. Those who should have been their greatest supporters trying to help them on their way instead saw them as overconfident, as arrogant as out of their minds. family dynamics and relationships are always going to be a part of this world. And as God's people sometimes doing the right thing will put us at odds with our own flesh and blood. Sometimes speaking the truth, saying something that's right, will cause others to be jealous to be envious and even to hate us. And that's what happened with these men. They were just following what God had told them to do. But in a minute, we'll see how they responded to the reaction of those around them. We'll also notice from this story of Joseph that he was exalted, and then lowered and finally, exalted. The story of Joseph is really about a series of peaks and valleys, highs and lows, success, and ultimately disaster. He starts off as a favored son, he's well loved. He's living in his father's house, he holds a position of great honor. He is trusted by his father. He sent out on various important tasks and duties. On behalf of his father, he carries out his father's business. One day, he goes to do an errand to find where his brothers are. And notice what happens to him. Look at verse 23, Genesis 37, verse 23. So it came to pass when Joseph had come to his brothers that they stripped Joseph of his tunic, the tunic of many colors that was on him. Then they took him and cast him into a pit, and the pit was empty. There was no water in it. They stripped him of this rope that he had received from his father, they throw him down into a pit. A pit is where you throw, trash and garbage. It's a place for discarding something that is has no longer has any value. It's useless. You throw it away, never to be used. Again. You discard it, but not a living person. Not someone who has value and worth and not just any person, but the prized son of a man of faith. Joseph is completely humiliated. He's sold into slavery, he's stripped of his identity carried away 1000s of miles away from his family, to live a life that he could have never imagined. He goes from prosperity to poverty, in just a matter of a few days.

Conrad Harkrider  12:17
In the story of Joseph, there is this emphasis on clothes. We hear a lot about the things that Joseph was wearing. And it seems as if each time his clothes are mentioned, or each time he changes clothes. There's some type of significant event that happens to him. Almost like there's a turning of a page, it's a pivotal moment in Joseph's life. And thinking about his clothes can kind of help us as we consider this idea of him being exalted, and then lowered, and then ultimately exalted. First of all, notice that he is given this colorful robe from his father, that robe, have blessed a magnificent president from his father, his brothers take that from him and tear it apart and dip it in blood. Of course, they lie to their father, they make it look like Joseph has been killed by this wild animal. And so now Joseph's life takes a drastic turn in the opposite direction. Well, the next time his garments or clothes are mentioned is when he leaves them with Potiphar his wife, Joseph had risen to a place of respect and authority in PATA for his house. But this act of courage lands him in the prison. When Pharaoh calls for him to interpret his dreams and chapter 41 And verse 14, it says that Joseph changed his clothes, he shaved himself before he went in before the king. And finally, when Joseph is exalted to be the ruler over all of Egypt, and chapter 41 And verse 42, he is given garments of fine linen, Pharaoh robes him with these garments, and promotes him to be the second in command over all the land. But Joseph goes from being this beloved son of his father, to being sold into slavery, ultimately lands in prison and then through God's provision and care, he rises to become second in command over Egypt, from a place of prominence, then humbled, and ultimately raised up again. The similarities between Joseph and Christ just jumped out at you because Jesus was clothed with all glory and majesty at the right hand of the Father. He had a place of prominence and power and authority. But he set that aside willingly. Joseph was sold into slavery against his will, he was taken from his father's house, not on his own accord, but Jesus chose. Jesus made the decision to come to earth, and to live as a man. In Philippians chapter two and verse five, it says, Have this mind among yourselves, which is yours in Christ Jesus, who, though he was in the form of God did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied himself by taking the form of a servant. Being born in the likeness of man, Jesus didn't come to earth, to have a life of great wealth and status, to have everything prepared and set before him to live a life of ease, but rather he took the form of a servant, He voluntarily lowered himself. The only way that Joseph could become the leader over all of Egypt, was if he was lowered, the only way that Jesus could cleanse us from our sins and to be exalted at the right hand of the Father as if he was lowered. And in the same way, the only way that we can enter God's kingdom, to become his children to be His people, is by being lower James chapter four. And verse seven says that we have to humble ourselves before the Lord and He will lift us up. Matthew chapter 18, in verse three, Jesus told his disciples that unless you become like children, you cannot enter into the kingdom of heaven.

Conrad Harkrider  16:49
being humbled, being lowered, taking the place of a servant is not something that we seek after those aren't positions that are desired. Joseph would have never chosen to go down to Egypt to be a slave in potter's house to land in prison for a couple of years. But God often uses humbling experiences. He often takes those valleys those periods of difficulty and hardship and he uses them to prepare his people for something greater. Joseph could have never seen what was on the other side of that experience. But God knew he was about to use him about to work something great. Through his life. Jesus reminded his disciples that the greatest leaders are those who are found serving others, those who put the interests of others ahead of their own. And this morning, we've sung all these songs about heaven and obtaining that reward and being in God's presence. But that is promised to those who are willing to submit and humble themselves in this life to lower themselves now so that one day, we can be exalted. Also, notice what is said in Genesis 39. Genesis 39, in verse six. It says, Genesis 39, in verse six, thus he left all that he had in Joseph's hand, and he did not know what he had except for the bread which he ate. Now Joseph was handsome in form and appearance. And it came to pass after these things that his masters wife cast longing eyes on Joseph and she said, Lie with me. But he refused and said to his masters wife, look, my master does not know what is with me in the house, and he has committed all that he has to my hand. There is no one greater in this house than I nor has he kept back to anything from me but you because you are his wife. How then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God? In the life of Joseph Joseph, we see that he resisted temptation and remained faithful. He retained his faith. Joseph had experienced an incredibly traumatic event, being cast off by his brothers sold into slavery taken away from his family. After being sold into Egypt, he must have thought to himself my father will come. My father will come rescue me my father will come after me what father wouldn't seek after their child. Joseph is waiting, looking, expecting a delegation to come from Jacob. Jacob was a man of means with servants under him. He could have sent to Egypt to purchase Joseph and bring him back home. But it never came. And so we're left wondering how to Joseph feel? What's going through his mind? How does he make sense of all of the things that have happened to him? Did he blame God? Did he become angry and bitter with his brothers? Did he take his frustrations out on those around him? It's interesting in the biblical account that the first words that are recorded from Joseph's mouth, come here in chapter 39, verses eight and nine, when Joe Joseph says, How can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God? So we have the answer, Joseph still believes he has retained his faith. And not only does he still have his faith after going through this great trial, but that faith is guiding his convictions, causing him to be a man of great character, changing the way he thinks and acts, giving him a compass in whatever situation he finds himself in. And so when he's approached by this immoral woman, who has status and power over him, tries to get Joseph to forsake His purity, he responds with how can I do this?

Conrad Harkrider  21:39
What's amazing about Joseph is he could have made a number of excuses, could have come up with a whole list of reasons of why it was okay, to go down this path. He could have said, I'm away from my, my family. This life isn't what I planned. It's not what I was expecting. For myself. He could have said, This is what I have to do to survive. This isn't the land of Canaan, this is Egypt, things work differently around here. He could have just said, This is too hard. I just can't, I have no other choice. She's practically throwing herself at me. But yet when the fire of temptation came on him, and heat of the moment, what we see from Joseph is that he physically removed himself from the situation, he left his garment in the house. And he ran out. We found some wasps in the house recently, I guess, with the colder temperatures, they've decided to come inside and stay with us. And not like a whole swarm of wasps, but just one or two here and there. But when those things make their way inside the window, and they start flying around, and you can see them and then eventually they make their way and they fly and sometimes land on the kitchen table where we're sitting. Can you imagine the reaction? All of the girls screaming people literally jumping up from their seats, running to the other other side of the room? Why do they do that? Because there is a perceived threat. They see this danger in front of them and they try to move away from it as quickly as possible. So often with temptation, instead of seeing it as a danger as a trap as a poison in front of us. We allow it to linger and stay close by as Paul warned Timothy and Second Timothy two and verse 22. flee away, run away from temptation. And that's what we see Joseph literally doing, taking himself out of that situation. Joseph is unique in the biblical account because we don't read of any of his sin or failings. Unlike the other patriarchs, Abraham, Isaac and Jacob and Joseph brothers. Their shortcomings are in full display, lying, deception, envy, jealousy, sexual immorality, it's all there. But the Bible is silent in regards to Joseph Joseph was different. There reminds us of our Lord when Jesus came into the world and he took on flesh and blood, he lived as a man. He had the same desires, the same feelings, the same urges that we have. And yet the verse that Kevin read for us this morning from Hebrews chapter four and verse 15, we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but One who in every respect has been tempted as we are yet without sin. Jesus knows what it's like to face all kinds of temptation. And not just that he knows but he is able to help us. Hebrews two and verse 18, in that he himself has been tempted, He is able to aid us in our moments of need. And so that's why it's important to keep prayer close to us to continue to stay connected to God to pray to the Lord and ask for strength, so that he can give us the strength and resolve to overcome to be connected to the Lord. Joseph resisted temptation and retained his faith.

Conrad Harkrider  25:48
Well, finally, in his most significant act, we see that Joseph provided salvation for his people. Look at Genesis chapter 45, and verse four, Genesis 45. And verse four as his brothers come to him in the land of Egypt, Genesis 45 And verse four says, And Joseph said to his brothers, please come near to me, so that so they came near, and he said, I am Joseph, your brother, whom you sold into Egypt. But now, do not therefore be grieved or angry with yourselves because you sold me here for God's sent me before you to preserve life. For these two years, the famine has been in the land and there are still five years in which there will be neither plowing or harvest. And God sent me before you to preserve a prosperity of posterity for you in the land, and to save your lives by a great deliverance. So now, it was not you who sent me here. But God. In the climax of the story, Joseph's brothers come down to him in Egypt, and He reveals Himself to them, his brothers are in a state of complete shock, and fear. They can hardly believe that Joseph, that brother that they despise so long ago, the one they had cast out of the family is now a ruler in the land of Egypt. In the classic novel, The Count of Monte Cristo written in 1844, it tells about Edmund Dantas, a man who is framed, wrongfully accused and imprisoned on an island fortress for a crime that he did not commit. After languishing in prison for many years, he becomes vengeful and angry. The story goes on to tell how he's able to escape from prison. He acquires a massive amount of wealth. And then he goes on to carefully and methodically plan and exact revenge and retaliation on all those who were responsible for his suffering. That's the natural response, the human response, taking revenge taking matters into our own own hands, holding people accountable and repaying those who have heard us. Joseph's brothers are concerned that after all, this time, Joseph is still angry, and that now he's in the position to finally repay them and take his revenge. But we see that Joseph did not come to try to harm his family, but instead he brought them salvation. He was protecting them. He was giving them life. He extends grace and forgiveness to those who cause such great pain and harm. And what's amazing here is in verse five, instead of being angry with his brothers, he's actually the one comforting them he's offering consolation telling them not to be upset. Because he understands that this was God's will. This was God's purpose, to bring him down to Egypt. Verse eight, he says, it was not you who sent me here. But God, the amazing providence and protection of God is seen throughout all of Joseph's life. God is constantly working to bring about his plans. And so it wasn't his brothers that sent him down to Egypt, but rather it was the Lord. God sent Joseph to preserve a remnant, verse seven to bring about the salvation of many people. Well, of course, we know that that was Jesus. That was his purpose in coming to the earth, to bring salvation to all people. When Jesus went To the house of Zacchaeus, there were some who were there that were questioning why he would eat with a sinner, why he would associate with that type of person. In Luke chapter 19. In verse nine, it says, Jesus said to him, today, salvation has come to this house, since he also is the son of Abraham, for the Son of Man came to seek and to save the loss. Jesus's purpose in coming was not to condemn and destroy.

Conrad Harkrider  30:32
It wasn't to punish people on Earth, but rather his purpose in coming was to seek and to save those who were lost, to bring salvation to the entire world. And just as he did in the life of Joseph, God used the evil actions of these men to bring about the redemption, the plan of salvation, for all people. What we have in Christ is so much greater than anything that we can find in this world. This world is full of disappointment, tragedy, sin, and evil. But Jesus offers the opposite of this world, he gives us comfort, hope, forgiveness, and peace. And as we see the brothers of Joseph, they're living in a land of famine, a land of need a land of great harshness, they come down to Joseph and he provides for them and so it is with the Lord those who come to him, can be can be provided with comfort, and strength. Jesus can give us that relief that shelter from the storms of life, he can offer us that assurance that no no famine, no virus, no hardship can take away from us. As Paul said in Romans chapter eight and verse 38, and 39, there is nothing in all of creation that can separate us from the love of God. In Christ Jesus our Lord. We're going to close with a song of encouragement. It's an opportunity for any who are here to respond to the Lord's invitation to come back to him to become one of his children, to submit your life to Christ, so that one day we can have that hope of being raised up to live with Him forever. There's something that we can do to help you this morning. Please come down to the front as we stand and sing
