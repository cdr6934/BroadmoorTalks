It was truly great blessing, as Curtis already mentioned, to be able to come together this evening to worship God to praise Him to give him what he deserves. We are His creation. We are His children made in His own image and likeness, we have an opportunity to come together to remember Jesus Christ and the sacrifice and to sing songs that exalt his name, and to hear a message that could potentially change your life. As God word continues to change my life. And hopefully, as Jeremy suggested this morning, we have assembled this evening with hearts overflowing with gratitude and thankfulness. Sometimes we complain when life gets hard, but the God that we serve is greater than our challenges. And we need to have attitudes and hearts that are full of Thanksgiving, the apostle Paul was that way, even writing these epistles from prison. And we need to certainly do that ourselves, I hope. Secondly, on a separate note that you're on a daily Bible reading program or schedule, I want to suggest to you that they'll make a huge difference in your life and your thinking and your faith and encourage your purity and your evangelism, all of that. I continue to use his particular schedule that I've been reading, listening to this year. And it gives me a lot of encouragement Plus, it gives me lots of sermon ideas. Now, maybe you don't have any sermons to preach, but you want to regulate your thinking with things that are true and right and honest. And so this lesson this evening was born out of this study. And then I have to share as well, did you ever noticed it the head the headings of each chapter in your Bible, it'll have some kind of a title bear. Well, I was noticing this sometime this week, and ended up talking with Paul Cook the other night, one of the former elders at Lost River. And the the the heading on in my Bible. And Hebrews chapter 11, is the triumphs of faith. And so it caused me to change the title of my lesson, which this evening is going to be talking about the triumph of faith. And so as I thought about that title, and it made me realize that the writers of these books in terms of the publishers putting this together, put these titles there to give us something to think about in and as I thought about this, it made me realize that in Hebrews chapter 11, really is a description of the triumph of faith in so many people's lives. And so I've actually just gonna look at the first 12 verses this evening. I realized, as I was working on this, this week, I could look at the whole chapter, which we're not going to do, but the first 12 verses this evening, so I want to make some observations about eight people here, kind of quickly look at each of these. But I want you to think about this phrase with me this evening, the triumph of faith. And I want to suggest to you that faith actually enables us to triumph over those difficult and strenuous challenges that we face in life trials, temptation, whatever is going on there. So this is very familiar passage of scripture. And so I'm going to I want to share these with you this evening, as we talk about developing the kind of faith that's going to help us to overcome this world appreciate the songs that Trevor led versus evening. And one of my favorite songs to the years of faith is to victory. And faith enables us to be victorious over challenges and trials and difficulties that each of us face. So let's look at this quickly. I'm gonna have all these scriptures on the screen. But the first thing I want you to notice, and he was Sheffy, living in verse one is by faith, we gain God's approval notice this text over here. And really, this is kind of a definition that we ought to pause to look at very quickly. It says no, faith is the assurance of things hoped for. The conviction of things not seen. That's what faith is, is the assurance of things hoped for the conviction of things not seen. So faith and assurance are not mutually exclusive. Faith is quite certain and assured. So faith is the assurance of things hoped for. But conviction of things not seen to the naked eye. Then it says, Excuse me, For by it. The people of old received their commendation of leave this as the English Standard Version. So I want you to think about this, for buy their faith. The people of old received their commendation who they received that commendation from was it the their local friends, their contemporaries? No, I believe they received commendation from God. That's how they gained approval with God.

Mike Roy  04:50
They earned a good reputation. They again Another translation says that they obtained a good testimony, testimony from home God was testifying about them, their faithfulness, their trust their service to God. In fact, another translation puts it this way it was by their faith that people of ancient times one God's approval. So when I say that faith is we try and fit our faith. Because ultimately, it puts us in a right standing with God, we win God's favor, by our faith, it's a remarkable thing to think about. So these Old Testament characters, and whether it's Abraham, or Isaac, or Jacob, they believed in God, they trusted him no matter what was going on in the world. And they were living for the life to come. And so I want to suggest to us this evening, that our challenge is to be like that we need to develop faith. And I trust that we we do have that and we need to baby develop that even greater in some ways, but it's a faith that allows us to win God's approval. So that's the first thing that we noticed in Hebrews chapter 11. Secondly, I want to suggest to you as we talk about the triumph of faith, faith leads us to understanding again, these the things are maybe simple and familiar to us. But sometimes we don't stop and think about this, oh, look at the text. It says, By faith, we understand. Faith leads us to understand by faith, we understand that the worlds were framed by the word of God. So the things which are seen, were not, were not made of things which are visible. And so what I want to suggest in a very basic way is the triumph of faith is a good understanding of the word of God. And that is a significant triumph. And so we think about that. So faith leads to understanding what do we understand what this faith teach us. And here's just a couple things. Based on this text, we understand by faith that the worlds were framed by the word of God. The BSP says the universe was created by the word of God that means to say, by faith, we understand when God commanded and the world existed came during world was created. And again, as we look at this statement over here, Faith teaches us that what we see was not they made what by what is visible. So when we look at a tree, or we look at the oceans, we understand that the tree was not made by another tree. Do we understand that, and that the mountains were not made by other mountains. Also, by faith, we understand that the Earth did not create itself. That's what this text is saying is over here, what is visible, was not made by what is visible, it was made by someone else other than his creation. And so fate teaches us that complex human life did not spontaneously arise out of nothing, and that the universe and everything in it was designed by the master designer by God, if so, that's where the with the the implication of that is over here. And so the point that I make here is that if a person never comes to faith in a powerful and mighty God, that they'll never know the reason for their existence. They'll never know the God who made them in his own image and likeness. You'll never understand the purpose of life, the meaning of life, and really prepares for person does not come to faith in God. They have no understanding of the things that matter most in life. So, the triumph of faith, faith leads to understanding. And if you look at God's creation, in your read His Word, and a person never comes to that faith, then they are people who are truly ignorant of what matters most. Thirdly, I want to suggest in this text, that faith teaches us to offer God proper worship and proper sacrifice. So again, you look at Hebrews chapter 11, verse four, this New King James Version, says, By faith, Abel offered to God a more excellent sacrifice than Cain, through which he had pain witnessed that he was righteous God testifying was gifts and through and through. And through it, he

Mike Roy  09:13
being dead still speaks. So faith teaches us to worship God acceptably. The New International Version puts it this way By faith, Abel brought God a better offering. And so it's a reminder that the Triumph think about this in very basic terms, the triumph of faith, is it it teaches us how to worship God, how to serve Him, except the what type of offering thing to bring to him. And I want to suggest that too many people don't worship God properly today, because they don't have a proper faith in His Word. They don't take God at His Word. They don't take him seriously. They don't believe that God's word has teeth in it when God gives commands. He Who believes and is baptized will be saved? That's exactly the truth. And we have to respond to that. And so again, we need to understand that God's Word gives us instructions on how to worship Him. If we want to know what type of offering or sacrifice to bring to the God of heaven and earth, we go through his worst of faith teaches us to worship God, properly, I want to suggest to you, while we're looking at this verse, that another triumph of faith is seen in the last part of this statement relating to Abel, it says, And By faith, Abel still speaks even though he is dead. So think about that, with me, that April's faith is still triumphing in my life and in your life, as we seek to imitate the same type of faith that he professed in developed in his life to know he's been dead for a couple 1000 years. My faith has impacted in your faith is impacted today, because of his example, and so it's a reminder that they that Abel taught us the importance of being reverent as we worship God, and and what we need to do to to please him. A fourth point that I want to make this evening very simple, again, from this text, is to simply suggest that faith pleases God. Sometimes we raised the question, what is it that pleases God? Well, faith pleases God. And you'll see that in this text over here. It says that By faith Enoch was taken from this life and just kind of going through these first 12 verses fairly quickly, by faith, Enoch was taken from this live, so that he did not experience dead, he could not be found because God had taken him away. For before he was taken, he was commended as one who, please God. So if you look at the one of the main messages there, in verse five, he said, By faith, Enoch pleased God. And so we want to acknowledge that, by our faith in God, we please Him, we do that which delights him. And so again, this first just talking about Enoch spade, and it was because of his faith that God pleased him. But again, you look at this text over here, this so familiar to most of us, and the see what this verse is saying about Enoch, and what God did for him. And what was the what was he next triumph of faith? Well, it tells us over here, that he was taken from this life so that he did not experience death. It said, he could not be found because God had taken him away. So what I'm saying here, because of Enochs, faith, God took this man off the earth, God kept this man from dying, because of his faith. And again, this was repeated that Enoch was not because God took them where to God, take them, God took them up to heaven. And that was because before he was taken up to heaven, he obtained witness that he was pleasing to God. I think one of the questions we have to ask as we go through this lesson this evening is, what is your triumph of faith? What are you seeking to overcome? What difficulty with hardship, what sickness was suffering, we don't make light of any of those things. But we're talking about the triumph of faith in his faith was so focused on God so strong in God, God picked them up and took them off this earth. Not suggesting that God will do that for us this day, but God will bring us through this life to arrive safely in heaven, I like to use mnemonics to and this came again, from my research, in terms of helping us understand what faith is somebody put it this way, force. If you use the acronym for faith, forsaking all I take him, F A ith forsaking all, I take him. And I think that was Enoch Sathya. He just wasn't concerned about this world, his whole desire, his singular desire was to please God and serve him. He did. So on the basis of faith, though. Sometimes you write those things down, and it helps to give a good appreciation or another meaning for the word faith. Let's continue to look at this text this evening. Actually, I want to bring up verse six, because verse five mentions Enochs, faith is being taken up from this life. And verse six, very well known verses scripture, and sometimes we may think that that stands independent of his context. I don't think it does. The truth is applicable to all of us, but it says right after talking about Enoch, that without faith, it's impossible to please God, because anyone who comes to Him must believe that He exists, and that He rewards those who earnestly seek Him. So the context of verse five by faith EMIC, please God He was, was was taken from this live. And because of his faith, he please God. And it goes on the writer says it goes on to say that without faith, it's impossible to please God. So you think in terms of the statement over here, Enoch believed that God existed. And Enoch believed that God rewards those who earnestly seek Him. And God did. And so I see for like, maybe for the first time, and maybe in a long time, if ever, the connection between verse six and verse five, so maybe the writers talking about Enochs faith, and of course, he can apply that to all of us. So, again, so simple realization, that what pleases God is faith, faith that trust Him that follows him that serves him that obeys Him. The fifth point that I want us to notice, excuse me this evening, is that faith develops reverence for God in obedience to His Word. And again, these are verses that we're all familiar with. The text says that by faith no, of being warned of God concerning events, as yet unseen, in a reverent fear constructed an ark for the safety of his household. By this he condemned the world, and became an heir of the righteousness that comes by faith. So what what did what was the triumph of Noah's faith, he built an ark. But he was moved by reverent fear, godly fear, and to do something that would be seen as just unreasonable and that they in time didn't make any sense to, for Noah to build an ark. There had never been any rain at that time in history. And so from a human standpoint, this was seen even crazy. But God told Noah to build the ark in view of the impending judgment of a flood that would destroy this earth. And Noah believed God, and Noah obeyed God, Noah's faith triumph in his life, and only seven other people were saving that day in time he and his family. But notice faith triumphed over incredible odds. And again, when I'm suggesting that faith develops this reverence for God, and in obedience to His Word, when it's all said and done, we can profess faith in Christ into a blue in the face. But at the end, we have to, obviously, obey God's word. The next verse, verse eight says that by faith, Abraham, when he was called obeyed, faith, obeys the Word of God. So let's go ahead and jump into numbers. Point number six, get some very practical things here from this text, want to suggest that faith says yes to God, and no to fear in all of the unknown as we continue to look at the Bible characters were so familiar with them. But again, making some applications over here. It says in verse we just made reference to this in verse eight. By faith, Abraham obeyed when he was called to go out to a place that he was to receive as an inheritance. And one of the most striking statements in Scripture that follows there in the last part of verse eight, and he went out not knowing where he was going. So God, God calls him from his hometown of early counties, to take take your family, take your wife, your nephew, go to the promised land, and I'm going to fulfill my purposes through you, and through this land through ultimately through some people. And Abraham said yes to God, and no to fear. How many of us do that? So Lord, I understand, show me the plan. Which way am I going? And and so as we think about situations in our life, we all we oftentimes say no to God, and yes, to fear, yes, to worry, yes to doubt,

Mike Roy  18:56
yes to uncertainty. Abraham said yes to God. And he said no, to all of the unknowns, how, how was Abraham going to make it to this promised land? How is he going to get there? Will he survive with his wife survive? Will his livestock survive so many questions? How would he be fed all these questions swirling around his mind? And again, Abraham is a man who trusted God. So again, a time where we sometimes we throw the phrase out that this time of uncertainty, in some ways, I don't like that, because this life is still very certain way. And we still serve a God who, who has a plan and is working on a timeframe and a schedule to bring us home to be with Him in Heaven. He still wants us to save souls. And so, but again, this text reminds us that we need to have the same attitude that Abraham has, so we need to say yes to God and no to worry. Again, we talk about all these unknown with the virus, this political world that we're in the economy and all of that But as Christians, we know God, we know God's word. And we know his promise never to leave us never to forsake us. And we know that he was going to provide us all things that pertain to life and godliness. We know that God is bigger than the struggles that we face. And and we by that faith, we will triumph over that. Again, here's another

Mike Roy  20:21
mnemonic that we might use to talk about the word faith, if a ith I guess we're so familiar with this, feeling afraid I trust him. Wow. That's very powerful to think about. So again, that that relates to Abraham, that no doubt he had lots of fears and doubts, how am I going to get there, and all this other type of all these questions swirling around him, but Abraham, again, said yes to God, and no to all of the unknowns. Let's look at a few other examples this evening. Number seven, Faith sees when we're talking about the triumph of faith, faith sees beyond this life. So look over here at the text, in Hebrews chapter 11, verses nine and 10. This is the NIV says By faith is toma Abraham By faith he made his home in a promised land like a stranger in a foreign country. He lived in tents, as Isaac, as did Isaac and Jacob, who were heirs with him have the same promise. It says For he was looking forward to the city with foundations whose architect and builder is God. What are you thinking about today? Where is your mindset? Are you thinking about the economy? Are you thinking still about this election? You think about the vibrators you're thinking about your job situation, those are all natural things that we think about. But while Abraham lived his life in in said yes to God, and no to worry, it says in verse nine that he lived, though he sojourned, he made his home in the Promised Land, like a stranger in a foreign country. That was in Texas, we are living in tents, who, with his, with Isaac, and Jacob, who are also heirs of the same promise. And so you look at this passage over here. And again, it reminds us that that Faith sees beyond this life. Again, we talk about discouragement and worry that sometimes we experience in the world that we're in so many ways, the year 2020 seem so, so different, so challenging. But we're not living for this world. We're living for the world to come. And every time we gather around the Lord's table, we we remember his death until He comes. That's one of those powerful promises we have in Scripture. And so our challenge is that not to get caught up in this world, not to get caught up in this life. Faith sees beyond this life. There's a song that we sometimes saying is the verses this world is not my home, I'm just passing through, my treasures are laid up somewhere beyond the blue, the angels beckoned me from heavens open door, and I can't feel at home in this world anymore. Too many of us seem to be too comfortable the world around us. And when the stock market's doing well, and our investments are doing well, we get so excited. But when our investments are going down, we get discouraged and depressed. And all these types of emotions again, enter our mind. But what we see with Abraham and so many others, like him, Faith sees beyond this life, how many more days you have on this earth? Don't know. And people die from all types of things, and that not always just old age. But faith is, is something that will allow us to see beyond this world to to the world that is to come. So can we see that very clearly in Scripture that Faith sees beyond this life. And the last point that I want to talk about this evening before we review this lesson from Hebrews chapter 11, the first 12 verses, faith is able to achieve what is impossible. So you look at this text over here.

Mike Roy  24:18
Again, following on the heels of Abraham who was looking for the city whose architect and builder was God, so he was on a mission to lead his family ultimately into God's presence. And since I'm here by faith, even Sara herself received the ability to conceive even beyond the proper time of life since she considered him faithful, who had promised therefore even from one man in one who was as good as dead at that there were born descendants who are just as the stars of heaven in number. And as the innumerable grains of sand along the seashore so even Tom but Abraham the writer of Hebrews is Tom but Abraham has faith. Now he talks about Sarah spade. And before I forget it so many times we are quick to criticize these Bible characters Abraham or Isaac or Jacob, Sarah Oh, they did this to Sarah did this. And let me say something about these people they were, they were men and women have great faith. If you had been Abraham or Sarah, would you say yes to God? Or would you say get somebody else, Lord is not for me. But so look at the context over here that that by faith, Sara received ability to conceive even beyond the proper time of life. And we're blessed at Broadmoor to have so many children, so many babies, we still have expectant mothers. I don't have any announcements about expected mothers this evening. But as anybody on our list to pray for expectant mothers who's 75 How about 6555 4540? Anybody? Sarah, gave birth to a baby boy, she's 75 years old, she believed the promise of God and changed the course of history, along with her husband, Abraham. So she received the ability to conceive from God beyond the proper time of life. And it says that, since she considered him faithful, who had promised faith, the triumph of faith in Sarah's life is she gave birth to a child of promise, again, a fulfilling God's purposes. Again, notice the result of that, from one man and really one woman. And he's nearly 100 years old when Isaac is born. And Sarah is 75, that they were born descendants who are just as the stars of heaven, and number in the Inuit, and as the innumerable grains of sand along the seashore. And so together, Abraham and Sarah basically gave birth the entire Jewish nation. It started with Sarah's faith, God says, you're going to have a child, and she believed God, she had her doubts, and we all would, but she believed God. Abraham believed God, again, and so their faith triumph over their fears. And so it's a remarkable story and think about what faith is able to accomplish. So let's look quickly at what we've talked about this evening, and talk about the triumph of faith. So pay more attention to those subtitles or headings in your Bibles. I thought, Wow, this whole chapter is talking about the triumph of faith, the people that great things, almost impossible, things that were impossible, it was impossible for a woman 75 years old to have a baby, but by God's power he brought that brought that about. So through the triumph of faith, we gain God's approval. That's not a small thing. If you have the approval the whole world and not of God, we've lost everything. The triumph of faith leads us to understanding. We learn to offer God proper worship, we have a faith that will pleases God. We see that faith develops reverence and obedience of God so we are faithful to Him. Our faith triumphs where we can say yes to God and no to fear and no to worry. Faith sees beyond this life. And the triumph of faith is is able to achieve even the impossible. And so it's no small message to understand when we're talking about faith in we just looked at a few people this evening in this chapter, maybe look at some more of those later on, as we have opportunity. But the real question, I think for each of us as we close the lesson, is for us to ask the question, what is your triumph of faith? What's going to define your life? What? What are you seeking to overcome? What difficulty what sin? What setback what financial adversity? What doubt what worry what whatever it might be? What feel feelings of incompetence or inadequacy? That that's the question for us to take away from the lesson

Mike Roy  29:17
this evening. What is your triumph of fate? There's lots that we can deal with. So maybe it's overcoming the struggles of this this year with the virus, maybe some type of worry, or difficulty that we're all we all face in our lives. But we take an opportunity to say sing a song invitation. If you need any encouragement or help with your faith. We're here to pray with you. We all have our struggles. We all have our doubts, I believe before honest in that regard. But this gives us an opportunity if you need or at want the prayers of this congregation. We'll be glad to assist you in any way that we can come up with stand to sing this invitation song
