As I say, often when I get to preach, bring the message from God's word. It's such a blessing and a privilege and an honor to come and worship our God who assembled together this evening, to remember what Jesus did on our behalf that the praise God thank Him, and to be reminded that his greatness, His power, His Holiness as purity, it defies human expression. And, and, and even comprehend and so worshiping God is the greatest thrill that we as Christians can engage in. And so we have an opportunity to do that again this evening. Join the appreciate the, the prayer and the the thought that works table, the song which song again, and in spite of the pandemic that we're experiencing, and hopefully winding down, that God is still God, he's still on the throne. He's still worthy of all glory and praise and honor. And we are here this evening, to give him that type of praise and honor. A couple of weeks ago, we had to fly him to Nashville, both of you know about that. And some of my members Phillip and Patricia, Greg, that hit pretty hard and probably maybe some others as well. But so that was on a Saturday evening that really happened in that Sunday afternoon after worship, just and I ran over there just to see what to do to help out. But the first thought was, I felt like it was in a war zone. I saw a car out in the field, having a car get prepared. I saw a car up a tree, not literally, all the way up the tree, but it was it was kind of going up the tree. So it had that car. On the edge of a tree. Well, the flood did, obviously. And so every time we witnessed these things, it's reminder of how powerful God's creation is. And, and we're just amazed at what can happen when a flood takes place. And so when we got there to the creek was still moving pretty fast. And I remember talking to Phil and and I guess Patricia there and she told Phil on Saturday night, before they went to bed was about 10 o'clock. And she said Phil, you better go outside and look at the level of cream. See how it's doing. So he went out there at 10 o'clock, it was full, but stable. An hour later, after six inches apparently of constant rain. That embankment was overflowed the yard was overflow, the street was overflowed. And that blood pushed their barn downstream and crashed it into the house. Fortunately, it didn't damage it too badly. But he's he mentioned that to me several times and just one hour. Every everything changed. And that rain kept coming at 10 o'clock get back there. Okay, go to bed at 11 o'clock, the floodgates were open. And there was no stopping it nothing to do at that point except to scramble make phone calls to save as you can and but ever since that discussion that we had that Sunday afternoon, in just one hour, this blood changed everything. It made me think about a passage in the book of Revelation Chapter 18, where basically says in one hour, Babylon will be laid waste. And that's symbolic language referring to the nation of Rome. So this evening, we're going to be doing something a little bit different tonight. Basically going to read the entire chapter of Revelation Chapter 18. If you want to turn it'll be on the screen as well. We're gonna look at Revelation Chapter 18. I'm going to pick it in smaller sections. I'll have that up on the screen, basically, outline the chapter in five sections just to get a sense of the chapter certainly not to discuss all of the language in the symbols here we'll leave that the David sometime who's got a lot more experience and maybe study revelation did i do but I was just still there but but anyway, yeah, we want to look in Revelation chapter 18. This evening, and and look at the message here. And you'll see that this language comes up this phrase is used at least twice in one similar to that. And I want to say as well as we come together to worship God this evening, that we're gonna be reading scripture tonight and making some comments and then some observations about that. But I would say there's tremendous value in power. In reading the Word of God a Conrad mentioned that this morning is less than

Mike Roy  04:51
an hour in the Tim Paul's message to Timothy when Paul told Timothy, to devote yourself to the public reading of Scripture and We do that at Broadmoor. As we did that this evening, Brad is read another scripture in the sequence of going through the book of Psalms, but reading the Word of God is one of the most powerful and beneficial activities that we can engage in. And I think, as I've said, Through the years, when we read the Word of God, we hear the voice of God, and we want to be changed into into more and more like the image of Christ. And we want to continue to read God's word. And so, and I think too, and, and all of us who preach instead of maybe always striving to come up with a catchy phrase per title, the except get someone's attention, or using some humorous illustrations to make people chuckle. And during preaching, sometimes all we need to do is read the Word of God. And a lot of churches, unfortunately, around the country, even in some churches of Christ, the messages have been changed. And the emphasis is more towards enjoyment, or whatever. But the truth is, all we have to do is read God's word, and we will be changed by it, and he will be glorified through that process as well. So we want to always preach and share God's word plainly and compassionately in love and boldness, in season olive season when it's convenient when it's not convenient. So this evening, we're looking at Revelation Chapter 18. And I titled it obviously from the praise that picking from Bill was total destruction in one hour. So this one is one of the key phrases that we find in Revelation chapter 18. Now, I want to say that we we need to speak with great frequency on God's love and His mercy, and His grace and His kindness. And we do that we have to constantly be reminded of God's character, he is holy, he's just and but we certainly want to express his mercy, his grace and His love. But there's another aspect of God's character that we have to preach about. And that was one of the things that Conrad mentioned the lesson this morning, that truth has to be taught, we have to preach on the holiness of God. And we have to preach on the judgment that is coming. And not be caught, unawares, like so many people will be. And so it's a reminder, that that, that judgment day is coming. And so we want to live holy lives and pure lives, constantly turning away from sin and seeking to become more Christ like in that process, and doing all that we can to reach friends and family with the gospel. But judgment day will be like that night, when the rain descended, and the floods came. And then it overwhelmed almost anything in its sight. And so in preaching, our goal is to save the loss, obviously, the saved sinners, but it's also to keep the save, save. That's our goal gone, I'm sure Jeremy shares that, for the tan and Conrad, anybody who preaches God's Word we want to, after we save people sold, we want to keep them safe, I want to keep myself safe. And so that's one of the goals and preaching, and messages that deal with impending destruction, get my attention and get your attention. And so I think we want to be balanced obviously, in our preaching, but we see that message in Scripture over and over and over again, and it's there for a reason. So we're looking at revelations you have to 18 and get over there mites. Myself, I've got this on the screen, and Revelation Chapter 17, and 18. Again, think the Think of the context of Revelation, the Christians in a first entry like John who's now banished Allah Patmos are facing serious persecution, many of them are being put to death and being tortured. It's just very sit, serious situation. And so John receives these messages he's visions, and chapter four, chapter five. And throughout, that we're basically encouraged him to key and a Christian is there to keep serving God faithfully to understand that maybe even though Christians have lost their lives, the battle is not over God's gonna win ultimately, and that in Christ as eternal victory, and and that's where our competence should be. And so we touch so chapter 17, and 18. Basically, a bring a message against sinful Rome, and it's symbolically called Babylon because maybe the comparisons between the two nations. So don't be confused by that as we look at that this evening. So the first thing if you looking in Revelation, chapter 18, I'm going to put this up on the screen.

Mike Roy  09:48
We see a powerful and a glorious Angel, announcing, quote, Babyland great fall. This again is Rome, but the symbolic language is used To because of some comparisons to the evilness of Babylon and also to Rome. And so again, we're just going to look at Revelation Chapter 18. Not make a lot of comments here, but maybe save that to the end. And so John says, After this, I saw another angel sees a lot of angels of Revelation, I saw another angel come down from heaven, having great authority, and the earth was made bright with his glory. Wow.

Mike Roy  10:29
Don't overlook that. So John saw this angel coming down from heaven having great authority of powerful angel, the Earth was illuminated with his glory. And he called out with a mighty voids, fallen Fallen is Babylon the Great, she has become a dwelling place but demons, a haunt for every unclean spirit, a haunt for every unclean bird, a Han for every unclean and detestable beast, for all the nations have drunk of the wine of the passion of her sexual immorality, and the kings of the earth have committed immorality with her and the merchants of the earth have grown rich from the power of early luxurious living. Rome was the epitome of Bice and indulgence and sexual immorality and fornication and greed and licentiousness is no adjectives to describe where they were at in their lives. And so the message is coming to to Babylon to Rome that they brought that Rome was going to follow the God is going to destroy this nation, because of their sinfulness and in the city, the place that was one so powerful, so rich, and so a fluid is going to become like a desert area, a deserted place, where the animals will be hiding out in the, the, the hollowed ruins of these these buildings. And so again, the first scene is hidden revelation, tip 18, a powerful, glorious Angel announces babblings break off. And then, and verses four through eight another voice urges God's people to come out of her. So John continues to receive this vision. He said, I heard another voice from heaven saying, Come out of her my people so that you will not participate in her sins and receive any of her plate for her sins have piled up as high as heaven. And God has remembered her offenses, pay her back even as she has paid and give back to her double according to her deeds. In the cup which in the cup which he has mixed, mixed twice as much for her notice the the double payment when God pays back evil and punishment for his these people who have rebelled against them, he pays back double what they had given out. And so in verse seven, to the extent that she is glorified herself and live luxuriously, to the same extent her torment and mourning or give her torment and mourning, for she says, in her heart, I sit as a queen, and I am not a widow, and will never see mourning. For this reason, in one day, there's that phrase, in one day her plagues will come, play and mourning and famine, and she will be burned up with fire for the Lord God who judges her is strong. You've got to see the power of God, the Holy Spirit of God, even these angels are so terrifying and frightening to consider their their power, their holiness, and their voice and message there. And so in view of the impending fall of Rome, God's telling his people through this angel to John, I want my people to come out of her not to be in the world, we have to be in the world, but not of the worlds he tells them to come out of the world, not to be caught up in her sins, lest they receive any of her plagues. And so, again, it's interesting language here that her sense of piled up as high as heaven. So reminder that God knows, God knows what's going on. He sees what happened with what's happening on the earth, The Good, the Bad, and The Ugly. The sins of mankind in Rome's day were piling up as high as heaven. And God couldn't stand it any longer. And he destroyed them. And so you see the pride of Rome, and she's personified as a woman as a queen. She's not a widow widow. She's never going to see mourning. And we understand that and Scripture Pride goes before destruction and that's what happened to Rome. But the language there in one day, for plagues will come plague of plague and mourning and famine. So this is like a preview of what's going to happen of the suddenness of the judgment of God's going to come upon Rome so quickly, that there's going to be no escape. The third section, we continue to look through

Mike Roy  15:13
Revelation Chapter 18. This section is basically the lamenting of the devastation or the devastating fall by the kings, the merchants, the Shipmasters, the sailors and passengers. So just trying to get you give you a sense of what's happening here. So in this section of Revelation, chapter 18, you have all this lamenting and mourning, but it's basically by the merchants who were engaging in and their business and practices and in no doubt, some of the simple practices, and they're really grieving over their loss of income, that Rome has fallen, and we're not going to be able to engage in all these activities and make our money there and the ships will not be able to go there. And so, um, first nine, the kings of the earth are mentioned, and the kings of the earth who committed acts of sexual immorality, and live luxuriously with her will weep and mourn over her when they see the smoke of her burning. standing at a distance because of the fear of her torment, saying, Whoa, whoa, whoa, the great city, Babylon, the Strong City, and there's that phrase, or in one hour, your judgment has come. In one hour, it was going to be over not literally, but symbolically a very quick and sudden judgment is going to come upon upon Rome, and all those who dwell there. Let's continue to look through the chapter. And

Mike Roy  16:43
so that was just mentioning the kings. And now it mentions in verse 11 Hope you can see some of these verses here. It mentions that the merchants, the merchants of the earth, weep and mourn over her so here you see all these people are mourning this devastating destructive fall of Rome, immersed into the city weep and mourn over her because no one buys their cargo anymore cargo of gold, silver, precious stones and pearls. I'm linen, linen, purple, silk, and scarlet, every kind of Citrine wood every, every article, I read every article made from very valuable wood, bronze, iron and marble, cinnamon, spice, incense, perfume, frankincense wine, olive oil, fine oil, wheat, cattle, sheep, and the cargo of horses, carriages, slaves and human lives, says the fruit of you the fruit you longed for has left you roam, and all these things that were luxurious and splendid have passed away from you, and people will no longer find them. So again, the merchants of these things who became rich from purple standard of distance, because of the fear of her torment, we think in mourning. So why are the merchants weeping over the fall of Rome, is because of their own loss. That's kind of it's like a selfish mourning, and weeping and mourning, saying, Whoa, whoa, the great city, she who was clothed and fine linen, and purple, and scarlet, and adorned with gold, precious stones and pearls, there's that phrase, for in one hour, such great wealth has been laid waste. All of the Agilent affluence and success of Rome all of that came crashing down to is going to come crashing down in one hour, such great well, has been laid waste. And every ship master and passenger and sailor, all who make the living by the sea stood a distance. So you see that this is a relationship driven by the Commerce and the sailors and the transporters of cargo, coming to this great place, engaging in business and plus, no doubt, all the sins that were along with that bribery and greed and fornication. And all these people now the sailors, the passengers, the Shipmasters, are standing at a distance and they're crying out as they saw the smoke of her burning, saying What city is like a great city see Rome, but it would never fall Babylon thought it would never fall almost every major world empire thought they would never fall. But the truth is, they all fell and that will happen to any nation that that on the face of the earth, especially anyone in opposition to God. So they're they're crying out What city is like the great city, a through dust under head. They're crying out weeping and mourning, saying, Whoa, whoa, the great city in which all who had ships at sea became rich from her prosperity. There's that phrase again. For in one hour. She has been laid waste. A whole history of Rome going up in smoke, the language the air In one hour quickly, suddenly, totally complete destruction. It with these people words we say in a military way shell shocked and couldn't believe what was happening. So in this section you see the lamenting by the kings, the merchant, the Shipmasters. And the fourth point that I want you to see from this text is that all the saints, the apostles and prophets rejoice over God's judgment of bronze. So in verse 18, in a very different tone of the chapter, it says, Rejoice over her, Oh, heaven, and you saints and apostles and prophets, because God has pronounced judgment for you against her. So interesting twist over everything. Up to this point is weeping and mourning these people a grief stricken, a lot of it. A lot of this is selfish. But here's the situation with all of Heaven. The saints, the apostles and prophets are rejoicing over God's judgment. I will say this, these saints of God, and these apostles and prophets have a rejoicing at their demise. I don't think that's what the text is indicating here. I think they're rejoicing over the defeat of evil and the victory of righteousness, that righteousness will prevail. God's will is going to prevail, God's people are going to win. Sometimes we remind ourselves in preaching, that when we're facing trial, and temptation and adversity, and sometimes we feel down or discouraged or depressed, don't forget, we're on a winning team, God's people are going to win be eternally, God's Church is going to win. So we don't ever want to give up. But while we're still in the battle, so here in verse 20, is a kind of a breath of fresh air, the message that God gives to John to again, this angel is Rejoice over her or heaven, and you saints and apostles and prophets, because God has pronounced judgment for you against or God brings judgment against those who reject Him. And then the fifth section over here,

Mike Roy  22:03
and this is verses 21, down to verse 24. So again, a mighty angel, notice how many times times angels are used communicate God's will in this situation to John, but the mighty angel predicts the complete destruction of grown by hurling a great millstone into the sea. And so is this a chapter kind of comes to a conclusion. The message from God says, then a strong angel picked up a stone like a great millstone, and threw it into the sea, saying, so will a Babylon, the great city be thrown down with the violence and will never be found. Again, don't forget, he's talking about Rome. But throughout this section of Revelation, he's calling Rome Babylon, because Babylon was the epitome of sin and bison and godliness, and fornication and idolatry and all that type of stuff. And so, the message is Babylon, the great city will be thrown down, but violence will never be found again, and the sound of the purpose musicians, flute players, and trumpeters will never be heard of you again. And no craftsmen or any crap will ever be found in you again, and it sounded a meal will never be heard and you again, and the light level lamp will never shine in you again and the voice of the groom and bride will never be heard in you again, for your merchants for the powerful people of the earth. Because all the nations were deceived by your witchcraft, and in her was found the blood of prophets and abstains in all who have been slaughtered on the earth. So here the judgment is coming against against Rome. And in certainly, God's people have been destroyed and slaughtered long, long before this, but in some ways, what's what's happening to Rome, what they were doing, they become symbolic of all of the evil throughout history. And all the persecution against God's people, in some ways, is attributed to Rome, and she is going to be totally destroyed. So again, another angel, giving the message ultimately Godwin's and the enemies of God God bloops. And Christians in this time who were facing severe persecution needed to learn not to give up or to go back into the world, which could be a temptation for them. And it can be a temptation for us. So when we look at revelations, yep, at some practical things I want to leave with you this evening. What do we learn from this kind of graphic account of the fall of Rome or the fall of Babylon as it's described? Well, the first thing, I'm going to suggest that judgment is sudden and unexpected. And again, the phrases in one hour so we think about and one reason that we have to preach on God's impending judgment with some frequency Because when that day comes, is too late to change. When that floods started coming down south Nashville behind Phil in Patricia's house, once that water starts rising, it's over. There's nothing else you can do. Fortunately, it is but not like the flood in Noah's day, and people's lives are spared. But once that flood comes, there's nothing that you can do. And it's and the difference with this one versus in 2010. mansion was the suddenness of it. In 2010, the water is going up more vehicles away from the water. now or later, the water cooler is coming up, they move more vehicles away from the water get up in the driveway, an hour later, the water still coming up. And then they bring the cars to the street now or later, they

Mike Roy  25:42
get this you know, they put the cars across the street. What happened just a few weeks ago was so sudden that you couldn't do that. It came in so fast that the water flooded the cars. I remember looking at his big dually that huge truck, it was moved by the water like wow. And seeing that barn, float down river and crash into a house. And it was anchored it was anchored to the ground like like mobile homes had been done to put that thing in there. It was still moved. So again, the message from from God to each of us is that judgment is sudden, is unexpected, we need to be prepared for that. The final judgment will be complete in total devastation. So every judgment whether it was against Sodom and Gomorrah, or the people in Noah's day, or the people in Jesus day is thinking about the the fall of Jerusalem. We're all symbolic and types of the final judgment. So that's why we preach, right? That's why we preach with such sincerity with such conviction because when judgment day comes, it's too late to change. And certainly, we want to save those who are lost in sin. But one of the other objectives I mentioned the beginning my lesson, we want to keep the same saved, want to keep people who are in God's fellowship with Him. In that relationship. We know the temptations, we know what happens, we can get discouraged. And sometimes Christians walk away from family, a man may walk away from his wife after many years of marriage and break that covenant. Why because of temptation, because of worldliness or whatever it may be. But we realize that judgment is coming. And if we break those vows and covenants and destroy families, we're are answerable to God for that. So final judgments can be complete and total devastation. And the realization of this judgment, again from Revelation 18 will be one of shock and awe and terrifying fear. People just flabbergasted that a city that had existed so long was so powerful, we're so rich, we're so fluent God, in one hour, they are history, and all of that, that that wealth, and all that stuff is gone. And so revelation teaches us some important lessons that we need to be reminded of, and it's not the kind of thing that we want to talk with, enjoy talking about. And even as I contemplated this lesson for tonight, you know, we're of course, we're New Testament Christians here seeking to serve God, I'm imperfect. I've got my weaknesses, you've got yours as well. But we have a heart set on doing God trusting him to get us through this life to arrive safely in heaven. But we we have to see this method because when the end comes in, it's going to come it will be terrifying, complete and total destruction. So that motivates us to try to reach family and friends loved ones neighbors, who have yet to obey the will of God but also empowers us and enables us to stay on that straight and narrow path and not swerve into the world again, but to serve God basically. And again, one of the messages, and I share this a lot with my mom and maybe a lot of people as we go through life and is trial and temptation and difficulties that we're facing, understand again, God knows, he knows who are His people. And he knows those who are not his, he know those he knows those who profess to follow him but are not obeying His will. He knows everything. Because then it's comforting because he knows our struggles. He knows our difficulties and he's they're compassionate for us. But understand again, and a message it's not taught much in the religious world is that God, a holy God punishes sin, and a holy God punish his sinful people. He gives him an avenue of escape through His Son Jesus Christ. But if people reject God's gracious offer of mercy and forgiveness, then they will face his holy wrath. And so again, the question for each of us is the time to prepare for the judgment is now and I trust. As I've mentioned, the Steven, we're here this evening is Christians to think, seeking to serve God, and in keeping ourselves prepared for that great day, and is a phrase, I'm not sure where I came across this years past, but heaven is prepared place. For a prepared people. We're making that preparation tonight while we, we come to worship our God. And so our challenge, I think, brethren is to see

Mike Roy  30:29
the sea daily that don't that the total destruction that's coming through the sinful world need to do that on a regular basis to see the end to see the glory of heaven. We'll see the destructive power of God's judgment. And what happens when we start thinking about visualizing Heaven or Hell? Well, it helps us to see what's most important and so COVID deaths or sicknesses suffer suffering stock market losses and gains, football games, baseball games, soccer games, hockey games are all insignificant. What's most important is knowing and doing God's will. So even as we sing the invitation song, we must remember that we shall stand before the throne of God, and our friends and our family members, we're going to stand before that same throne of God, maybe that there's someone here who needs to obey the gospel, we would be glad to do to help you with that this evening and accepting your confession of faith, your statement of belief in Jesus, willingness to repent of your sins, to be baptized for the forgiveness of your sins, or maybe that you need the prayers of this congregation. If there's any need that you have. We encourage you right now where we stand and sing this invitation song
