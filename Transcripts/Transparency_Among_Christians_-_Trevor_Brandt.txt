Good evening. didn't grab the microphone. Can y'all hear me, I'm assuming this one's on just fine.

Trevor Brandt  00:09
Alright, it's good to see all of y'all here, I'll just stay right here rather than moving around much. You haven't already figured out I'm not one of our regular preachers here. And thankfully, I don't know that could take the angst and the stress of that every week. So thank you all that do that on a weekly basis. It's a lot of work and very much appreciate the work y'all do and put in. To do that for us. Let me just provide a little bit of background information. First, before we get into the main point of the lesson is many of you know, some of the men at Broadmoor had gotten together a couple times over the last couple of months to talk about our struggles with anxiety, or for some depression. And these have been very, very helpful, helpful to talk about eye opening discussions for a variety reasons, I'm not really going to get into that. I wanted to bring that up, it's going to tie into something. So if you haven't been included in those and you would like to discuss things of that nature, by all means, let the elders know I'm sure they will be glad to incorporate you. In on on that. I'm not even sure I was supposed to bring that up. But I did. So. I'm sure anybody wasn't left off or any board and reason. But if you'd like to be included, that let them know for communication regarding future meetings, extra meetings. So I think that would be be good. But one thing that became apparent during these meetings is the importance of Christians opening up to other Christians about their life, their struggles, but also their joys and successes, as there were several men who emphasize mostly overcoming anxiety in their in their past. And as we are opening up about our lives, learning about others, getting advice and encouragement from one another, at one point, the question was asked something along the lines of why doesn't this happen more often? was worded something like that? Or why don't? Why don't we open up more about what we're going through? Why don't other people open up more about what they have gone through? It was a good question. And in the context of what we're discussing, it kind of halfway got answered, and then the conversation went elsewhere. But I've been thinking some about that. And so as it was my turn in the rotation here to give the fourth Sunday lesson, that's what I want to talk about tonight. Is you Yes, transparency among Christians. Specifically, we're going to look at why that may be a challenge, what are some benefits, and then some suggestions on implementing that in an effective way. Now, right off the bat, I want to say, I know there's some that probably don't feel like this is an issue at all, that's fine, you may already have a group of close Christian friends that you can talk to and open up about various things. And so it's not really something that you need more of, that's fine. That's great. You may already feel like at Broadmoor, there's plenty of openness and transparency from teachers and preachers and that sort of thing. And that's fine. This isn't really a there's not an exact right or wrong necessarily on this. So I do know that there are quite a few though that that feel like this is something that's that's lacking, and that there could be more of and hopefully, hopefully, we can encourage that tonight.

Trevor Brandt  04:07
So some reasons. Reasons why this can be a challenge. All those up there. Well, they weren't supposed to all be up. They're supposed to be one at a time. But it looks like they're all there. So that's okay. So one, one thing that might come up is people might say, well, I don't want to do that because I don't I don't want to feel vulnerable. I don't want to look bad. I don't want to be embarrassed. What will others think? We don't want to we don't want to feel like we need help. And all those I'm lumping all those in because there's another word for that which you probably already saw. That's that's pride, those type of thoughts. That's, that's just another way of saying we're too we have too much pride. To be able to do that, and opened up with others were to can CERN with what people may think. And we aren't willing to open up to others about what's going on in our lives are worried about looking bad in the eyes of man. What's interesting kind of ironic is that the Bible teaches that if we're prideful, that actually brings us shame. In the eyes of God. There's a passage I want to look at Proverbs 11, to the New American Standard, I've got that one here. It says, When pride comes, then comes dishonor. But with the humble is wisdom. The New Century Version not familiar with that one, it says pride leads only to shame. It is wise to be humble. And the the Message translation kind of a paraphrase says the stuck up fall flat on their faces, but down to earth, people stand firm. So here we are trying to be to avoid shame, by being prideful, and that's the very thing that brings brings shame in the eyes of God. So my experience here Broadmoor is that when people have been open and honest about their difficulties, and struggles that they have, they are not met with ridicule, demeaning ridicule, and gossip. I haven't seen that maybe it's happened at some point. But it's not something I've seen. There's been encouragement and prayers and support. And I'm sure we can do better with this. It's hard sometimes to know exactly what to say to someone. But we are, we're not enemies. Here. We're all on the same. We're all on the same team. So if you need to open up to someone in particular, specific, or to the elders, or to the church as a whole, I don't think you're gret doing so. I think it's been working some on this. I don't know we got that's all right. All right. So another reason why this can be a challenge is fear of actually discouraging others. In the process. This may seem kind of strange. But if you talk about your problems, and your fears too much, there's the danger that it may actually cause that to be a problem in someone else. And so maybe we have a, you know, kind of a righteous reason for not doing this. So we're we don't want to bring down others. I remember Gary, when Gary Henry mentioned something in a sermon a long time ago, that he said when he was when he was a younger preacher, he would talk a lot about challenging issues for him and struggles and difficult Bible passages that were hard to exactly know what was going on different things of that nature. And, and he said that there was a older person that came up to him one time and said, Gary, people have enough doubts and fears on their own, give the people some hope and assurance. So maybe, maybe there is kind of a fear of that, you know, it's kind of if you have a unusual fear of spiders, and you go around talking about how awful spiders are, and there's spiders everywhere and people get bitten by spiders, and we swallow them in our sleep, I don't feel heard that it's not true. You know, that kind of thing is just, if you talk about that, you may create that fear in someone else. So maybe, maybe people are not wanting to weigh others down too much. There is a point to where we try to could try to put too much on other people try to to put things on other people that really only God can can handle but I don't think that's an issue most of the time, but it is something to be aware of. Thank you, David. He is so good back there. Alright, so maybe you just say I'm just a private person. You know, some people don't feel comfortable talking about themselves either good or bad. They just want to keep to themselves. They don't you know, like it when people

Trevor Brandt  09:11
have party forum or you know, they they just want to come home from work and stay home or better yet just work from home. You know, maybe there's people like that. They're the ones that that the lockdowns last year didn't really bother at all they're kind of maybe hoping we get another lockdown at some point. So that that's a common. That's a common struggle with people. Maybe they're just, they are just more private in nature. There's a verse that I try to focus in on with this because I tend to fall in this category. Proverbs 18 verse one says, Whoever isolates himself seeks his own desire. He breaks out against all sounds judgment, averse always really stood out to me that if you isolate yourself, you're not doing yourself any good. And so it says here, he seeks his own desire, he breaks out against all sound judgment, the sound judgment would be to be among others and not to isolate yourself. And we know proverbs 2717 that says iron sharpens iron. so one man sharpens another. So we have to open up to one another to get wisdom and instruction from others. So another reason this could be a challenge is, again, maybe a legitimate concern. We don't want to make things seem too much about ourselves. It could be legitimate, after all, we don't want to, we want the focus to be on God, we want all that we do to be about God, nobody wants to listen to somebody talk about themselves, all the time, we don't want to be that person. So of course, there is a balance that we have to find. But David talked about himself quite a bit in the Psalms. But the focus was always outward on what God had done and what God did for him. We're going to read from Psalm 66. If you want to turn there, I don't have any of the passages on the screen hits. Apparently, I you know, I couldn't even get this going. So adding the passages and is going to be a bit much. So Psalm 66 says, Come and hear all you who fear God and I will tell you what he has done for my soul, I cried to him with my mouth, and high praise was on my tongue. Verse 18, if I had cherished iniquity, in my heart, the Lord would not have listened. But surely God has listened, he has attended to the voice of my prayer, Blessed be God, because he has not rejected my prayer or removed his steadfast love from me. He was talking a lot about himself there, but it was in connection to what God had done for him. It wasn't a selfish, talking about himself. So yes, there's a danger of making everything about us. But transparency done properly, lets others see God through us. One of the, I guess scientific definitions of something being transparent, is that light shines through it, and then can be seen on the other side. So if you want to kind of make that connection to us, if we're open and transparent about things, it's allowing that light, which the true light is God, to be to be seen through. So if those little pictures help help you think about it in those in those terms. So maybe it's just too painful. Maybe things we've been through or going through or just too difficult to talk about. I get that I've been there with things. Hopefully, you're talking to God about it, and casting our anxieties on him because he, he cares for us, we read in first Peter five. And maybe you need more professional help than just talking to somebody who maybe hasn't dealt with the level of, of struggles that you're you're going through, that is fine. But there may be others that need to hear what it is that you've been through. I came across these two quotes in preparing for this that I thought I'd share. One, it says your transparency, creates transformation, and others. So think about that your transparency can create transformation and others. Another one was your greatest area of usefulness may stem from your greatest area of pain. Your greatest area of usefulness may stem from your greatest area of pain. I think we've seen that in some people's lives here at Broadmoor that, that we've seen their faith through difficult circumstances. And then as they talk about that, it helps others it helps them to grow, grow in their faith. So

Trevor Brandt  14:14
you know, Paul, hopefully we haven't done things to the level of what Paul did. But Paul essentially killed Christians and was actively resisting anything to do with with Jesus and trying to stop the spread of the teachings about Jesus. And yet he he was able to use that to help he, he talked about that. If you want to turn to x 26 I'll read a short passage from there. This is all talking here. It says I myself was convinced that I ought to do many things in opposing the name of Jesus of Nazareth and Burstyn and I did so in Jerusalem. I not only locked up many of the saints in prison and After receiving authority from the chief priests, but when they were put to death, I cast my vote against them. And I punished them often in all the synagogues and tried to make them blaspheme and in Raging fury against them, I persecuted them even to foreign cities. So that was probably not fun for him to talk about. But he talked about that to communicate that even though he had been the strongest supporter of the Jewish faith in traditions that you could imagine to the point of putting to death Christians, because he thought they were opposed to God's ways. Even he realized that reconciliation comes through Jesus, and he had to be transparent about his past, in order to effectively communicate that. Maybe you think, well, nobody else is transparent. That's just not what we do. That's not what others are doing here. And why it would be great if others take would take the lead on this. It's always nice when others take the lead on things. But if you desire deeper friendships and conversations, and you want to see a more authentic and real side to people, probably the best way to get that is by opening up to others. First, somebody has to take that first step, might as well be you. I think you'll be surprised at the readiness for people to open up if you take that that first step. If you start talking about something deep and serious, like nobody responds with boy weather sure is crazy out there, you know, they're gonna open up and talk to you about things as well. There's more of these are just the ones I picked. So let's talk about some of the the benefits. And again, there are a lot we could look at. But one is to know that we are not alone in our struggles, it's helpful to know that you aren't the only person that struggles with a certain issue. One of my favorite verses to remind myself of is First Corinthians 1013, that No temptation has overtaken you that is not common to man, God is faithful, and he will not let you be tempted beyond your ability. But with the temptation, he will also provide the way of escape, that you may be able to endure it. While we know that's true from the Bible, we need that reminder that there are others that are going through or have gone through similar difficulties as ourselves. Let me check the time here. I don't want to keep you all too long. Um, you know, most of you. Sorry, I looked up in that that clock said six o'clock or No, it says 12 o'clock. Nevermind, I thought that said six. So I was thinking man, I didn't think I talked that long. Alright, um, so you know, a lot of times whatever we're going through, we we may feel like we're the only one that's ever gone through that. But we know the Bible teaches that's not true. And then if we talk to others, we will find out that's not true as well. Most of you know this about me, but I was married before I was married to Emily and my previous wife was unfaithful to me. And going through that, obviously a very difficult and trying time. And one thing is very helpful is when other Christians who had been through the same thing, talk to me about that. I know that, especially now looking back on it, I know that couldn't have been easy for them, they because you have to relive that. If you want to just not ever think about those kinds of things again, and just act like it never happened. But there were Christians that did talk to me and they it would probably wasn't easy. And I really appreciate what they did. And they were willing to open up because there was a brother in need. So it's it's good to know that we're we are not alone in our struggles.

Trevor Brandt  18:56
Benefit of transparency is to know what others need help with. I'm going to read a few passages here on on ways in which we, we we help others Galatians six two says bear one another's burdens, and so fulfill the law of Christ. Second Corinthians one four says, talking it says who comforts us in all our affliction. So that we may be able to comfort those who are in any affliction with the comfort with which we ourselves are comforted by God. First Thessalonians 511 Therefore encourage one another and build one another up just as you were doing. Romans 1215 Rejoice with those who rejoice weep with those who weep. We can't bear one another's burdens. Rejoice with those who rejoice. Weep with those who we comfort each other, encourage one another if we don't know what's going on in each other's lives. And one of the main things that we've done in the The two meetings that we've had about anxiety is we have, we've told our story essentially, of dealing with that to one another. And I've been surprised at not only the number of people that that effects, but some of the severity of the effect as well. That I didn't, I didn't know about it, it's good to know what our brethren are dealing with so that we can be praying for them and possibly provide some help, and encouragement. There is accountability with transparency, maybe there's sin in our life. We're areas we know that we can do better in that we want to do better in when that is brought to light and exposed. There's accountability. Now, if we let someone know an area that we're working on, they can they can ask us how we're doing. They can encourage us. They can, perhaps prompt us to do better remind us of our commitment that we've made to improve. Hebrews 312 says, take care of brothers, lest there be in any of you and evil, unbelieving hearts, leading you to fall away from the living God. But exhort one another every day, as long as it's called today that none of you may be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin. Hebrews 1024 says and let us consider how to stir up one another. To love and good works. not neglecting to meet together is the habit of some, but encouraging one another. And all the more as you see the day drawing near. If we are more open with each other about our temptations, we are able to be more effectively exhorted by one another, to do better. Helps transparency helps connect with others. Transparency is often an appealing trait to Christians and to non Christians knowing information about each other. That's the basis for friendships. That's how we make friends in life. Being open about your life makes you more approachable. This can be helpful in being able to encourage Christians but also in connecting with with non believers. You know, Christians are sometimes perhaps unfairly but quickly labeled as hypocrites. And in not speaking of Christians, but Jesus talking to the Pharisees in Matthew 2327 says, Woe to you scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, for you are like whitewashed tombs, which outwardly appear beautiful, but within are full of dead people's bones and all uncleanness. You know, there is a tendency for Christians for us to make ourselves look outwardly beautiful, as that passage says. Now, hopefully, we aren't full of dead people's bones and all uncleanness we do have struggles. And as Christians, we don't claim to be perfect. But we do try to put our best foot forward. And when non Christians see us in our non perfect state, you know, when we have struggles and maybe say something we wish we hadn't, when they see that it's easy for non Christians to conclude that we're pretending to be something we're not that we're that we're hypocrites that we are, we are trying to appear one way, but really our life is another way. But if we've already opened up about difficulties, that argument is no longer valid, they may actually be encouraged to share their struggles. And then we can do our part two, point them to the Lord. The more open we are, the more approachable we become. And it's much more likely that people will open up to us. So some effective implementation of transparency, discretion. So you know, I've done a lot about talking that we need to do this more, but there is too much as well. So we need to, we don't need to disclose every sin or struggle that we've ever had to every person that we meet, and everybody here necessarily,

Trevor Brandt  24:10
you know, especially be cautious with who you're talking to, you know, people of the opposite sex and things of that nature. And then obviously, there's discretion not only with the person opening up, but whoever it is that you open up to there, there has to be trust there and trustworthiness not betraying that trust but by telling others something that's told to you in confidence, so there's there's got to be discretion really on both both sides here. I came across a list of questions and I added and changed a few of these. Most of my questions, I thought I'd put them on the air. I'll just read them out. Consider these questions. Well, my personal anecdote doet accelerate learning by clarifying a Bible truth. Well, my personal illustrations show the benefits of obeying a particular truth, or the painful consequences of neglecting it. Well, my self revelation encouraged others to share needs and prayer requests. Will my self disclosure meet a genuine need in my life? For emotional support and prayer? Will my illustration portray friends or family in a negative manner? Or be embarrassing? And if so, have I received permission from them? Am I telling this to build others up, or to elevate myself in my sharing this to glorify me or to glorify God? So good questions to ask as we're considering transparency to, to one another into people in general. And this kind of goes without saying, but we got to point this out that if there's transparency to one another, and people were telling you things that maybe you didn't know, that could be kind of shocking, we want to be understanding. But the other side of that we want to be exhorting in love when needed. This is one of those things that's much easier said than done. I remember playing baseball as a kid, there was this kid's mom who had always yell, when somebody was betting on our team, don't swing it, no junk. But if it's in there, hit it. That's the point of baseball, you know, that's we, you whenever you're up there, bat and you're trying not to swing it balls, and you're trying to hit the strikes. So that's kind of like, it's kind of the way I feel with this. We know this. But that is a hard thing to implement. So we need to be supportive and understanding. But there's a time when rebuking an exploitation is needed. And it can be difficult to know exactly how much to emphasize and when one is needed more than the other. So let's extend grace to each other on both sides of that. There is a fine line between being supportive, and condoning and enabling sin. So we don't want to do that either. Let me give an example of what this type of transparency and understanding and exploitation looks like in real life. At one of our meetings about anxiety, depression, a relatively older, well respected man said to a younger man who was opening up about some struggles, he said, Brother, so and so when I look at you, I see me about 30 years ago. What a great statement. And he went on to encourage this younger man that, yes, you may have some areas to work on. That's kind of to be expected. Sure, you might feel like you're struggling. But hey, I've been there. I've lived a similar life. I've had similar struggles. And yet, I'm on the other side of most of those. And I have confidence that with help from others, help from God, and you doing your part, you'll get through this. And anybody who was there knows, it was said out of love. It wasn't in a demeaning way whatsoever. It was supportive, encouraging, but challenging. At the same time. Both sides exhibiting honesty and transparency, trying to help a brother in his walk with God. I think that's how God wants us to be with one another. And I think Satan hates it when we are. So if, if you need to open up to the congregation to ask for prayers, and help, we're here for you. If you need to do that, in a more private setting, that is fine as well. And maybe you know that you haven't been open and honest and transparent before God and are ready to return to him or to confess your faith and be baptized starting your walk with Him. there's anything we can do to help please come forward while we stand and sing
