Unknown Speaker  00:01
Thank you. Open your Bibles if you would, to solve a to solve a last night we talked about Psalm 69. And our purpose was to see the type of Psalm that Jesus fulfilled that type of Psalm, an individual omit. Psalm eight would be classified as a Psalm of praise. And we will also see how Jesus fulfills this psalm how Jesus fulfills Psalm eight. But one of the things it's, we're gonna look at the text, we're gonna see Jesus fulfillment of it, you can feel free to ask a question or make a comment. And, but one of the things I found interesting about Psalm eight, in 1969, when America landed someone on the moon, they had some kind of digital message there that they left on the moon. And they asked 73 countries to include some kind of statement to put on the moon, if anyone ever found it. And the Vatican, put some a date in there. So Psalm A, which we'll talk about the moon is on the moon. And it addresses God in second person, throughout, does it make a call to praise, but it just describes the rider as praising God and being part of a community, which is praising God? There are different ways we could outline the psalm. But one of the ways is to look at verses one and two is a description of God's glory and majesty, verses three through eight, talking about God's exalted position, and man's. Finally, in light of God's greatness, what is man and God giving man exalted position, position, and then the closing of the psalm again, a statement of praise. But let's read the words of the Psalm we never go wrong. When we read the words of the text, Psalm eight, for the choir director on the guitar with a Psalm of David. Oh Lord, our Lord, how majestic is your name in all the earth, who is displayed your splendor above the heavens, for the mouth of infants and nursing babes, you have established strength, because of your adversaries, to make the enemy and revengeful cease. When I consider Your heavens, the work of Your fingers, the moon, and the stars which You have ordained, what is man, that you take thought of him, or the son of man that you care for him? You made him a little lower than God, you crowned him with glory and majesty, you make him to rule over the work of your hands, you put all things under his feet, all sheep, and oxen, and also the beasts of the field, the birds of the heavens, the fish of the sea, whatever passes through to pass of the sea, oh, Lord, our Lord, how majestic is your name in all the earth. You may have noticed, the psalm began and ended with the same words, oh Lord, our Lord, how majestic is your name and all the earth. When a section of scripture begins and ends with the same phrase, we can call that that includes the word inclusion. It doesn't have to be an entire chapter. For example, the Sermon on the Mount, Jesus began by blessing or the poor in spirit, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. In that he ends the Beatitudes with blessing to those who are persecuted for righteousness sake, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven. It can be a short section of Scripture, but the significance of it is this. I think we are to see everything in between. through the lens of that statement, that includes yo even though some of this sob may seem to exalt man The purpose is not to exalt man. The purpose is to show the glory of God.

Unknown Speaker  05:09
All that God has done for man and the exalted position God has given man, all of it is for the purpose of God's glory.

Unknown Speaker  05:20
And so everything we say tonight, please see it through that lens of see how also how glorious, how majestic

Unknown Speaker  05:33
God he is.

Unknown Speaker  05:37
One of the things that I've realized

Unknown Speaker  05:39
in a study of the Psalms,

Unknown Speaker  05:43
I think, placement of the Psalms makes a difference, even though I can't explain always why this song was placed here and that song was placed there. It makes a difference. Psalm seven ended with these words, I will give thanks to the Lord according to His righteousness, and will sing praise to the Lord, to the name of the Lord Most High. Psalm seven indeed on a note of praise and Psalm a continues that no, oh Lord, our Lord. First, he addresses the Lord. You notice the word Lord is in all capitals from the Hebrew term Yawei, oh Lord, that He says our Lord, he is part of a community which is worshiping the Lord, oh Lord, our Lord, how majestic is your name. When the Bible talks about someone's name, it's not talking about their reputation. It's talking about their character. It's talking about who they are, oh Lord, our Lord, how majestic is your name. That is what you are. That is your greatness. And you have displayed your splendor, the text tells us above the heavens, God's splendor, God's glory is written all across creation, and all across

Unknown Speaker  07:09
the sky, which is made, the heavens are telling the glory of God. Their expanse is declaring the work of his hands. Psalm 91.

Unknown Speaker  07:28
A love the statement of Romans 120. For since the creation of the world, His invisible attributes, His eternal power, and divine nature had been clearly seen, being understood, do what has been made. So they are without excuse. Romans 120 says God's invisible attributes, and it mentions His eternal power, His divine nature, His invisible attributes can be clearly seen. Kind of a con, it's kind of a contradiction, isn't it?

Unknown Speaker  08:10
I heard one famous atheist, say, if he ever appeared before God, he would ask why God did so much to keep himself hidden. And I'm thinking, are you serious? every sale in the human body proclaims His Glory. In the heavens above, proclaim His glory.

Unknown Speaker  08:46
how majestic is your name. You've displayed your splendor above the heavens, for the mouth of infants, and babes you ever established praise? Now I think the point of verse two for the males of infants and babes that you have established praise. I think the point is to stress that it's often through those who are the smallest and the weakest that God demonstrates Himself and His glory from the mouth of the infants and nursing babes. Do you remember when in Matthew 11, verse 21, Jesus prayed and says, I thank You, Father, Lord of heaven and earth, that you have hidden these things for the wise and intelligent, and you have revealed them

Unknown Speaker  09:37
to babes.

Unknown Speaker  09:40
It's often the simple, the infants and the babes that recognize their dependence upon God and their need for God. Paul said in First Corinthians 127 28, that God has chosen the weak things of the world to convey Elda strong in the in the, but God often chooses the unlikely to demonstrate His power for the mouth of infants and nursing babes, you have established strength, because of your adversaries to make the enemy and revengeful sees. He says, When I consider Your heavens and the work of Your fingers, the moon and stars which you have made, what is man that You are mindful of him? Now, in this section, I like to look upon this as a series of contrast, in these verses, one, there is a contrast between the heavens as massive as the heavens are, The heavens are small, when contrasted to God. Now, where do I get that from this verse? When I consider the heavens, the work of Your fingers,

Unknown Speaker  11:03
God with his little fingers, is pictured as putting the objects of the heavens, together, the work of Your fingers in verse six, the Bible speaks of the work of God's hands, the work of God's hands, the work of God's fingers. Some of you probably know these kinds of things, much more than I do. Do you know that if you started at one end of our galaxy

Unknown Speaker  11:44
and traveled the speed of light,

Unknown Speaker  11:48
which no one's ever been able to do. But if you could travel the speed of light,

Unknown Speaker  11:55
to you know, it would take you 100,000 years to get to the other edge of our galaxy.

Unknown Speaker  12:09
And the gal in a difference the distance between our galaxy, and the next closest galaxy, is many times greater

Unknown Speaker  12:20
than that. And God spoke it all into existence. If the universe is that big, how big is the maker of it?

Unknown Speaker  12:47
I love the statement. He makes in his little commentary on Isaiah in the new Bible Commentary Derek Kidner says,

Unknown Speaker  13:00
God dwarfs his creation.

Unknown Speaker  13:04
God is so far beyond his creation, He dwarfs it, and makes it look small.

Unknown Speaker  13:12
Now, if we all realized,

Unknown Speaker  13:15
at all times in our life,

Unknown Speaker  13:18
how big God was,

Unknown Speaker  13:21
if we understood this truth, that take care of every spiritual problem

Unknown Speaker  13:27
we had.

Unknown Speaker  13:30
Some are Isaiah 50, as a 40, verse 12, says, Who has measured the waters in the hollow of his hand and marked off the heavens by the span. But when you consider how vast the universe is, it is overwhelming to think how big our God is, he is so big, so strong and so mighty. There is nothing that he cannot do. But he said, When I consider the heavens, the work of Your fingers, the moon and the stars which you have made, probably the Psalm was written at night. And he says, what is man that You are mindful of him or the son of man that you care for him, in spite of the fact that the heavens are small compared to God's glory?

Unknown Speaker  14:28
The heavens are incredibly huge. From the standpoint of one little person looking up into the miles and miles of space. And we wonder, How could God care for each one of us? What is bad This particular word that's translated what is used all kinds of times in the Old Testament.

Unknown Speaker  15:08
But it's usually used with inanimate objects, not with people, and even saying, What is man instead of Who is man, maybe a way to put us in our place, to make us realize our insignificance, and to be overwhelmed. And what an incredible thing it is, that the God who spoke all this into existence, the God whose presence can dwarf the heavens,

Unknown Speaker  15:44
that God cares about you.

Unknown Speaker  15:55
See, a man starts a business, he originally has no employee except himself, he becomes successful, he has to employ several other people, the business continues to grow, he continues to prosper, he employs more and more to do the work that he needs to be done.

Unknown Speaker  16:16
After a while he has 1000 employees, does each one of those have a personal relationship with the Creator of the company, and to think about a God in a planet, of over 7 billion people. Knowing what you're thinking at this moment, and caring about you, is an overwhelming thought. What is man that you're mindful of he'll

Unknown Speaker  17:00
also say in putting these points together, the heavens can be so impressive that sometimes in the ancient Near East, people worship the heavens themselves. And there were restrictions given against that in the Law of Moses, in Deuteronomy 419. And Deuteronomy 17, two and three, there were there were times in Israel's history that they fail into worshipping the heavenly beings, for example, in the days of Manasa. In Second Kings, chapter 21. And Jeremiah eight, verses two and three, you see that they constantly were tripped up by this, but we don't worship the moon and the stars, we worship a god that is so much bigger than he could speak

Unknown Speaker  17:49
them into existence. Now, she looked at your translation in verse five.

Unknown Speaker  17:59
It says, You made him a little lower than God's some of your versions are going to have something like heavenly beings or angels. The Hebrew text has the word God. That anxious translations most of the ancient translations like the ancient Greek translation, Septuagint, has the word angels, but you made him a little lower than God. Man who is so small and so insignificant compared to the vast heavens, is given an exalted position in creation. Given exalted position creation, the small universe is contrasted with man's exalted position, you make him ruler over the work of your hands, you put all things under his feet, all cheap oxen, and beasts of the field, the birds of the heavens, a pass of the past, the fish of the sea, whatever passes through the pass of the sea, there are several points taking, building on that last point. Man is small in contrast to his exalted position in the universe, man is a virtual King in creation. Look at some of the words used in verse five, you crown Hild with glory and honor, here are times that verb is used, which is very rare in the Old Testament, and it's used of people who put literal thrones on people's head, make them kings, you crowned him with glory and honor Psalm 21 is a royal Psalm, and it uses these two words in reference to the key and you may kill them to rule. Remember, in Gideons time they come to Gideon and said, You rule over us and he said, I will not rule over you and my sons will not rule over you but God I will rule over you. It's the same word that used here in this passage. What I'm saying in all of this is either you have the vocabulary used that applies to Kings, someone 10 doesn't use the same word rule. But what Psalm 110 does is it pictures that King raining until God has put all enemies underneath his feet.

Unknown Speaker  20:26
What I'm saying is this, it is amazing thing, that God so exalted, so great, so majestic, so mighty that God gives man such a focal part in his creation sometimes a

Unknown Speaker  20:59
few years ago, for example, we had a member that

Unknown Speaker  21:03
just wanted to take us to the circus. So we, we ended up going and and they have the man some point in a cage with six lions. Now,

Unknown Speaker  21:22
anybody here

Unknown Speaker  21:25
have a job like that they

Unknown Speaker  21:26
control lions. If, before I criticize you, that may be as far as to ask if there's any of you out here. Like the I think, what are you thinking about?

Unknown Speaker  21:35
Somebody has a job like that. But it's an amazing thing. That man can control an animal who was one swipe of there, Paul,

Unknown Speaker  21:51
not even necessarily intending to harm but just being friendly, could crush

Unknown Speaker  21:57
your eyes. It's amazing.

Unknown Speaker  22:02
It's amazing. That man is given dominion over all the huge creatures that live on earth and to see if you take the most exaggerated projection of how large the dinosaurs were, if you take the most exaggerated projection, it doesn't come close

Unknown Speaker  22:30
to the blue whale that exists on earth today. And God has put all things

Unknown Speaker  22:41
under man's feet.

Unknown Speaker  22:43
It's just an amazing thing. In James three says,

Unknown Speaker  22:48
We can tame all kinds of wild creatures, but we can't tame

Unknown Speaker  22:55
the top. But it's amazing

Unknown Speaker  23:01
that we're given this exalted position in Genesis 11. It's a tower of Babel, man sought to exalt themselves, but here, God exalts them. This really is kind of a poetic retelling of the creation in Genesis one, verses 26 through 28. And he again closes this scene by saying, Oh Lord, our Lord, how majestic is your name and all the earth. All of this proclaims His Glory,

Unknown Speaker  23:35
and His power and His greatness.

Unknown Speaker  23:39
Now, right now in the text, before we talk about some places where this psalm is quoted in the New Testament, do you have a question there, or a comment that you want to make? John, the first part has Yahweh behind it, the second one doesn't need to come. First point is it just uses the term Yawei. It will be translated the American Standard Jehovah, when you have that word, in the Hebrew original, your translations will have the word Lord in all capitals. When that word is used in the Old Testament, it's used over 6000 times. When it's used in the Old Testament, it's going to be a reference to the true God always, always. The second word that used Oh Lord, our lowered is the term Adonai. Sometimes that word is used in addressing a king for example, or addressing another human being when Abraham encounters the three visitors who came to him in Genesis 18. And he doesn't know who they are at that moment. But he addresses deal as sirs. When he does that he uses a term ad and I. And he uses the second term, it is a term that refers to the true God. But it is not a term that exclusively refers to the true God. But I think by the use in this verse, He is saying, The Galloway, the God has revealed himself to Israel, the God who revealed Himself to Moses at the burning bush to God who brought the people out of the land of Egypt, that God is our Adonai. He is our Lord, He is our master, and we are submissive to him to helpful.

Unknown Speaker  25:49
Okay, well, thank you.

Unknown Speaker  25:53
And you know, I do appreciate, ask, I would appreciate you ask questions, that I can't answer that I do appreciate that further talent in remember what I just said.

David Tant  26:07
Yesterday, as we were driving home from our service, I was reminded the majesty of God and His appearance, because we saw two rainbows. Yeah. And go back to Noah. When God manifests himself and his way into every time we see a main rainbow, we can be reminded of God's power, and what God did for us

Unknown Speaker  26:29
and God's continual mercy.

Unknown Speaker  26:32
I will see the bow and I will never again destroy the world through a flood. But yes, absolutely. His presence is everywhere, is what you're saying, as even you're making a normal trip home, whether it be a sunshiny day, or rainy day in which a rainbow appears, you know, we can see God's glory in all these things. Psalm 29, for example, is a Psalm of praise, which talks about God's glory in a thunderstorm. Let's talk about how this psalm is used in the New Testament with the rest of the time that we have. And again, if you've got questions, you know, feel free to ask them. But look at verse two, again, for the mouth of infants and nursing babes, you have established strength, because of your adversaries to make the enemy and revengeful sees that passage is quoted in the New Testament in Matthew 21, and verse 16. Matthew 21, verse 16. Now, I put the conclusion up there. Don't look at that right now. Except if you want to just write down the verse, don't look at the whole idea. And I want to develop this idea. In Matthew 21. What is the context of this particular passage? In Matthew 21, Jesus has cleansed the temple. And when Jesus has cleansed the temple, the Bible says He entered the temple, he drove out all those who were buying and selling over turn the tables of the money changers and the seeds of those who were selling Dubs. He says, It is written My house shall be called a house of prayer, but you're making it and robbers do and he already alludes the two verses right there. He Aroo alludes, Isaiah chapter 56, verse seven, and Jeremiah seven verse 11. What Look at Verse 14, the blind and the lame came to him in the temple and He healed them that you need to Matthew's account of the temple cleansing. He heals a blind in the lane. In verse 15, when the chief priests, the scribes saw the wonderful things he had done, and the children who were shouting in a temple Hosanna to the Son of David, they became indignant and said to him, do you hear what these children are saying? And Jesus said to the old, yes, Have you never read out of the mouth of infants and nursing babies, you have prepared praise for yourself the blind new lamer healed the religious leaders. And I think this wording is ironic. They're indignant at the wonderful things Jesus is doing. Can you believe that? Jesus healing the blind to the light, but they're also indignant because some are shouting Hosanna to the Son of David, if you look at verse nine, they were shouting that into triumphal entry along the streets as he came into Jerusalem, but now they're shouting that at the temple courts, they are proclaiming him at is the son of David Thoreau proclaiming Him as the Messiah? And he says, Don't you hear what these children are saying? As if if you hurt him, you're going to stop them?

Unknown Speaker  30:11
And Jesus said, yes. Yes, I hear right. Have you never read out of the mouth of

Unknown Speaker  30:20
infants, and nursing babes, you prepared praise for yourself, Psalm, a verse to contrast the infants and babes with the enemy, and the

Unknown Speaker  30:35
avenging.

Unknown Speaker  30:40
Which of those two groups do the chief priests

Unknown Speaker  30:45
and scribes fall into?

Unknown Speaker  30:49
They fall into the category

Unknown Speaker  30:52
of enemy, and revengeful. But these children

Unknown Speaker  30:59
are proclaiming the truth,

Unknown Speaker  31:02
proclaiming the truth

Unknown Speaker  31:05
that these religious leaders who knew the law so well are too blind to see, Jesus is opening up blind eyes here in the temple, but some who were supposed to see are being

Unknown Speaker  31:20
shown blind.

Unknown Speaker  31:23
They can't see what these children are seeing, when they shout Hosanna to the Son of David, and Jesus says, Yes, this one feels the Scripture, out of the mouths of infants and babies, you perfected praise that will tell you what's remarkable

Unknown Speaker  31:40
about that a lot of things. One of the things is Jesus takes an Old Testament passage that speaks of God being prays, and applies it to himself. When we study the Psalms, we can

Unknown Speaker  32:06
see Jesus in the innocent suffer, or the righteous suffer of Psalm 69, of Psalm 22 of Psalm 31, who pour out their heart and grief to God, we see Jesus in those characters, but in the Psalms as we study them.

Unknown Speaker  32:30
When we look at God, we also see Jesus as well. I hope I'm being clear here. I want you to look

Unknown Speaker  32:44
at the passage I have on the slide, Psalm 102. This is one illustration of this particular idea is Psalm 102, verses 25, to 27, of old you founded the earth. And the heavens have the work of your hands, even they will perish, but you endure in all of the old will wear out like a garment like clothing, you will change the old and they will be changed, but you are the same and your yours will not come to an end. Now, this is Psalm 102, in context is a prayer addressed to Yahweh. Look at verse one. Look at verse one of this psalm, hear my prayer, oh, Lord, and let my cry for help come to you. What do you notice about the word, Lord there in verse one, John, what you notice about it? It's all capitals, all capitals, it's Yao Wei. So this is a prayer addressed to Yahweh. And it says, it makes these statements you founded the earth, and the heavens are the works of your hands, that statement, and I don't have this on the board. So let me encourage you to write this down. Hebrews one, Hebrews one, verses 10, through 12, Hebrews 110, through 12, quotes this passage, and specifically applies it to Jesus is emphasized in the context of Hebrews one that Jesus is so much greater than the angels. And he takes the words of Psalm 102 and applies them to Jesus.

Unknown Speaker  34:29
Jesus

Unknown Speaker  34:31
is the God revealed on the pages of the Psalms. And so when we see God being praised to the book of Psalms there's a statement to us about the greatness and glory of Christ, but also the portions that refer to me at least This portion in Psalm a also refers to Jesus. Look at Hebrews two, Hebrews two and want you to notice Hebrews two is going to quote from Psalm. Hebrews two is going to quote from Psalm eight. And it's going to specifically apply these words to Jesus. In Hebrews two verse five, for heated not subject to angels, the world to come concerning which we are speaking, but one has testified somewhere, some preachers have told me it's their favorite way to introduce a Bible quote, One testified somewhere. Say What is man, that you remember him of the Son of man that you're concerned about him, yet you made him a little lower than the angels, you've crowned him with glory and honor, you've appointed him over the work of your hands, you put all things in subjection under His feet. Now all of those are words that are quoting from Psalm a, particularly quoting from the Greek translation, you notice that pretty much all versions there have the word angels in verse seven. Notice how he takes the words of the quotation he's made, and starts to apply them to Jesus, for example, in verse six, excuse me, in verse eight, verse eight of Hebrews to you put all things in subjection under His feet. all things in subjection, will notice how much the word subjection is used in the rest of verse a, for in subjecting all things to Him, He left nothing that is not subject to him. But now we do not yet see all things subjected to him. But we do see him who was made for a little while lower than the angels. Do you see that in verse nine, where he states he's made a little while lower the angels, he's picking up the words of verse seven, he's picking up the words of Psalm eight. You see him who was made a little while lower than the angels, namely, Jesus, because of the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honor, that is part of the quotation in verse seven, you have crowned him with glory and honor. And it says, because of the suffering of death, you crowned him with glory and honor so that by the grace of God, he might taste death

Unknown Speaker  37:56
for everyone.

Unknown Speaker  38:01
The term Son of Man is Jesus favorite title in reference to himself?

Unknown Speaker  38:11
In the Gospels,

Unknown Speaker  38:14
but the term Son of man in the Old Testament, generally, is a poetic way of say, man, for example, Psalm eight, verse four, what is man that You are mindful of him or the son of man that You visit him? That's just a poetic way of say, man. Now an exception to what I've just said, Is Daniel seven verses 13 to 14, that talks about the Son of man, coming with clouds receiving power, glory and a kingdom. That's a different picture. But usually Son of Man is just a poetic way to say man, and yet this passage about man in his exalted place in God's creation, finds its ultimate fulfillment

Unknown Speaker  39:07
in Jesus,

Unknown Speaker  39:10
I love the way it was said by one writer when he said, This Psalm is viewed as having implications that are so big, they are fulfilled only by the death and resurrection

Unknown Speaker  39:34
of Jesus. I don't know how to do justice to this. But let me try

Unknown Speaker  39:54
it is overwhelming to me

Unknown Speaker  39:55
and I am sure to you, too. To look up into the heavens in a beautiful night, to see the stars, and to feel the nice breeze, and to think that the God, who spoke it all into existence, cares for me and visits me

Unknown Speaker  40:22
in the language of Psalm eight. And we could talk about those words in much greater detail than we have.

Unknown Speaker  40:30
But I want you to contemplate that thought. This thought,

Unknown Speaker  40:37
look up into the heavens, and see the God who created all thing. A God who is in need of nothing

Unknown Speaker  40:49
but a God

Unknown Speaker  40:51
who came to this earth,

Unknown Speaker  40:53
in the person in His Son Jesus.

Unknown Speaker  40:57
He said foxes have holes, and birds have Nast. But the Son of Man has no place

Unknown Speaker  41:07
to lay his hand.

Unknown Speaker  41:11
In the song, tell me the story of Jesus. We sing these words, He was despised and afflicted,

Unknown Speaker  41:21
homeless, rejected, and poor. And Jesus died a death

Unknown Speaker  41:39
by one of the worst means of execution and torture at the world that evil men ever conceived. to crucify someone to nail them to a tree

Unknown Speaker  41:59
until they simply expired.

Unknown Speaker  42:03
The God who made the heavens and spoke them into existence, the God who is bigger than all of our vast universe, that God not only knows about me and cares about me, but seeing His Son

Unknown Speaker  42:22
to die for me. You know what our response to that should be? Oh, Lord, our Lord. how majestic is your name in all the earth. That is so overwhelming. I cannot get my arms around it. All things

Unknown Speaker  42:51
have been put in subjection to Jesus. He is Lord right now. And he has been raised from the day that that phrase, all things had been put under his feet is used in Ephesians 122, to apply to Jesus in First Corinthians 12 In verse two, First Corinthians 15, verse 25, it applies to Jesus the point Jesus is Lord right now and all has been put under his feet right now, with the last enemy excepted death, but one day it will be put under his feet. He is King right now. But he's going to display that in a greater

Unknown Speaker  43:32
way in the future. And all of this should lead us to praise God and stand in all of him. Let us pray. Oh Lord, our God. How excellent is Your name in all the earth

Unknown Speaker  43:58
when we consider the heavens and the work of Your fingers, and we're in all a lowered at what you created effortlessly

Unknown Speaker  44:10
and we're in all that you care for us. And we're in all that You sent Your Son to die for eyes now you in your service, and your life, you and your service to our live.

Unknown Speaker  44:41
Make up our go. May you be our deepest desire. May we love You and praise You with all our hearts. And we know that you have prepared to raise us from the dead and to bring us home to an eternity with yourself. Oh Lord Our Lord, how majestic is your name? We praise you for what you've done through Jesus in His name Amen.

Unknown Speaker  45:18
is really hard picky down to Psalms for this week. Lord willing tomorrow night we're gonna try to look at it's a longer Psalm in this psalm 107 as an example of a prayer of thanksgiving if you want to read that Psalm 107. And Lord willing, we'll talk about that in class.
