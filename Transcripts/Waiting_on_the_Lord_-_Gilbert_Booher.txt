How do you feel when you have to wait for something? Are you able to be patient? What if it drags on for weeks, months? years? Can you still be patient? Middle of last March, we saw unprecedented changes in our world due to the Coronavirus things, you know that changes that most of us have not seen or many of us have not seen in our lifetime, though, instantly brought a lot of things to stop. So how have we done in waiting for things to resume? has its dragged on? Do we get impatient? Do we get anxious? Do we get irritated? Do we get discouraged? Do we get angry? There are times throughout our lives when we have to wait. We've all experienced it with this pandemic. And we'll likely experience many other occasions on which we have to wait. And how do we how do we handle that? Well, Scripture gives us some guidance. There are many times many passages in Scripture that talk about waiting on the Lord. So I thought this morning it would be good for us to look together some of those scriptures and see some guidance, some instruction that we can learn to help us in waiting on the Lord. Waiting is something that's been common throughout history we see in Scripture God's people had to wait many times in often for a long time. Let's think about Abraham. In Genesis chapter 12. Starting in verse one, now, the Lord said to Abram, go from your country, in your Kindred, in your father's house to the land that I will show you. And I will make you a great nation. And I will bless you and make your name great so that you will be a blessing. I will bless those who bless you and Him who dishonors you, I will curse and in you all the families of the earth shall be blessed. So Abram when is the Lord had told him in lot wit with him. Abram was 75 years old when he departed from Haoran. So God promised that he would make Abram into a great nation. And we read that this at this time he was 75 years old. Well, how long did he have to wait for his promise son to be born? If you flip over to chapter 21 of Genesis

Gilbert Booher  03:02
Genesis 21, starting in verse one, the Lord visited Sara as he had said, And the Lord did to Sarah as he had promised, in Sarah conceived and more Abram more Abraham a son in his old age, at the time of which God had spoken to him. Abraham called the name of his son who was born to him whom Sara bore him, Isaac, and Abraham circumcised his son Isaac, when he was eight days old, as God had commanded him. Abraham was 100 years old when his son Isaac was born to him. So he had to wait at least seven, at least 25 years from the time he was 75, to 100, for God to fulfill his promise. And later in Genesis, chapter 12, Abraham also has promised that he would receive the land in which he was dwelling the land of Canaan, that would be an inheritance to his descendants. Well, how long did they have to wait for that? If you look over at Acts, chapter seven, verse six, when Steven is recounting the history of Israel, he says, And God spoke to this effect that his offspring would be sojourners in a land belonging to others who would enslave them and afflict them for 100 years. So remember, Joseph, went down to Egypt and became one of the commanders there became second to the Pharaoh. And that was, he was led there by God so that God's people could be preserved when the famine hit the land of Canaan. So the descendants of Abraham dwelt in, in in Egypt for almost for over for around 400 years before they were able to go back and get that land that God had promised to Abraham. So the people had to wait a long time then What about when the people of Israel were taken to captivity into Babylon, because of their sins of idolatry, some of the prophets were telling them, oh, don't worry about this, this will be a short time and then you'll be returned to land. But Jeremiah was tasked with the, the the tasks, he was given the task of telling them, No, it's going to be a while, you're going to have to wait for 70 years here in battling. And so he wrote a letter to those who were living in Babylon in exile. In Jeremiah 29. He says in starting in verse four, that says, the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, to all the exiles who might have sent into exile from Jerusalem to Babylon, build houses and live in them, plant gardens and eat their produce, take wives and have sons and daughters, take wives for your sons, and give your daughters in marriage, that they may bear sons and daughters multiply their and do not decrease. But seek the welfare of the city where I've sent you into exile, and pray to the Lord on its behalf. For in its welfare, you will find your welfare. For this says, the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, do not let your profits and your diviners who are among you, deceive you, and do not listen to the dreams that they dream, for it is a lie that they are prophesying to you in my name, I did not send them declares the Lord. For this says the Lord, when 70 years are completed for Babel, and I will visit you and I will fulfill to you my promise, and bring you back to this place. For I know the plans I have for you declares the LORD plans for welfare and not for evil, to give you a future, and a hope. So these people, the people of the kingdom of Judah had been taken into captivity away from their home, they had to live in this strange land. That was, you know, unknown to them, they had to learn new language, because the people there spoke the different tongue from what they used. And they didn't want to be in that situation. But God sent them the message, you're going to have to deal with this for a long time, some of you may not be able to return back to your homeland, because this captivity is going to take seven years, they needed a long time to be able to shake that hold that idolatry had gotten on to them. So they had to be patient and wait, during that time wait for the captivity to run its full course.

Gilbert Booher  07:43
And what about the other promise that was given to Abraham, the promise that in his seed, all peoples would be blessed? Well, when that promise was given to Abraham, that was almost 2000 years before God would send his son. And when the prophecies of Isaiah which gave more detail about the Messiah who would come, that was about 700 years before Jesus would come to the earth, so God's people had to wait a long time for this Promised Messiah. But when the situation was right, when conditions were proper, God did send his son Paul talks about that in Galatians, chapter four. He calls it the fullness of time, in Galatians, four, verse four, but when the fullness of time had come, God sent forth his Son, born of woman born under the law to redeem those who were under the law, so that we might receive adoption as sons. When the time was right, God fulfilled his promise and sent the Messiah into the world. So as we think about how God's people waited in times of old and how we have to wait at times, I'd like for us to think about some questions that we can ask and examine from the Scriptures to see if we can learn techniques and tips that will help us in waiting on the Lord

Gilbert Booher  09:31
sorry, these were supposed to come up one at a time but something went wrong with the the animation but anyway, we'll we'll look at them one at a time. What first of all, what is waiting on the Lord, waiting on the Lord? What does it mean to wait on the Lord? Well, it means recognizing his power and trusting his ability. Let's look at Psalm 27. The basis of the first song We sing this morning Psalm 27 In verse one, The Lord is my light and my salvation, whom shall I fear? The Lord is the stronghold of my life of whom shall I be afraid, when he will do is to sail me to eat up my flesh, my adversaries and my foes that is they who stumble and fall, though an army and camp against me, my heart shall not fear, the war rise against me, yet I will be confident. One thing I have I have I asked of the Lord that I that will I seek after that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life, to gaze upon the beauty of the Lord and to inquire in his temple, for he will hide me in his shelter. In the day of trouble, he will conceal me under the cover of his tent, he will lift me high upon a rock. And now my head shall be lifted up above my enemies around me, and I will offer in his tent sacrifices with shouts of joy. I will sing and make melody to the Lord. Here, oh, Lord, when I cry aloud, Be gracious to me and answer me. You have said seek My face. My heart says to you your face, oh, Lord, do I seek hide not your face from me. Turn not your servant away in anger, Oh, you who had been my help. Cast me not forsake me not. For Oh God of my salvation for my father and my mother, if forsaken me, but the Lord will take me in. Teach me your way, oh, Lord, and lead me on a level path because of my enemies. Give me not up to the will of my adversaries, for false witnesses have risen against me, and they breathe out violence, I believe that I shall look upon the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living, wait for the Lord, be strong, and let your heart take courage, wait for the Lord. David faced many challenges. In any he had enemies against him who were seeking to kill him. He had various threats. He felt like, you know, people turned away from him. But he knew that God was still in control. He knew that God had the power to deliver him. And he was willing to trust in him and he was willing to wait for the right time. You know, there were times where David could have taken it into his hand to kill Saul. Saul was delivered into his hand in the cave, he could have reached out his hand and taking it into his own hand, and taking matters in his own hand to in the reign of Saul, but he was willing to trust in the Lord to wait on the Lord, he would not raise his hand against the Lord's anointed, because he knew that God would provide for him. He was willing to wait and be strong and let his heart take courage in God's deliverance. waiting on the Lord also means being willing to humbly submit to Him, allow him to lead us. Psalm 25, verses four and five. There we read, make me to know your ways, oh, Lord, teach me your paths. Lead me in your truth and teach me for you are the God of my salvation. For you I wait all the day long. Are we willing to wait on the Lord to guide us? Are we willing to look to his word and humbly submit our will to him? When we want to act and do something but we don't see guidance in Scripture for that? Are we willing to wait for him and let him provide the leadership and guidance that we need? First Peter, chapter five, also gives us some guidance along this line. In verse six, First Peter five, humble yourselves therefore under the mighty hand of God, so that at the proper time, he may exalt you. We sometimes want to exalt ourselves to get to that position that we feel we should be in.

Gilbert Booher  14:27
But if we exalt ourselves, we may find that God has to humble us. But instead, if we humble ourselves before Him and wait for him, then at the right time, He will exalt us. He continues in verse seven, and First Peter five, Casting all your anxieties upon Him, because He cares for you. When we wait, we can become anxious. We can you know, when we don't see exactly how things work out We can start to worry about it and in become, you know, upset and wonder how it's going to work out. But we need to remember Peters guidance, cast our cares upon Him when we feel that anxiety that worry popping up in our hearts. Take it to the Lord. Say, Lord, I need help with this. I'm feeling anxious about the situation helped me to trust you. Help me depend upon you and rely upon you. Waiting is Resting in God, resting in his ability to handle the situation, not worrying. So let's think a little bit about how should we wait on the Lord? How should we wait on the Lord? Do we follow our own wisdom as we seek to bring about his promises? Well, when we do that, it can cause problems. Remember Abram in Sarai Nadir later whose names were changed Abraham and Sarah, they had to wait a long time for that promise son to come along. So at one point, they got tired of waiting and they felt like they needed to help God along in in carrying out this promise. In Genesis chapter six team, we see that

Gilbert Booher  16:24
Genesis 16, beginning in verse one. Now Sarai, Abram's wife had born him no children. She had a female Egyptian servant whose name was Hagar. And Sarah said to Abram, behold, Now the Lord is prevented me from having fun bearing children, go into my service, it may be that I shall obtain children by her. And Abram, listen to the voice of Sarai. So after Abram live 10 years in the land of Canaan, Sarai, Abram's wife, took Hagar, the Egyptian, her servant, and gave her to Abram, her husband, his one as a wife. And he went into Hagar and she conceived. And when she saw that she can see she looked with contempt on her mistress, in Sara, I said to Abram, may the wrong done to me beyond you, I gave my servant to your embrace. And when she saw that she had conceived, she looked on me with contempt. May the Lord Judge between you and me. But Abram said to Sarai, Behold, your servant is in your power due to her as you please. Then Sarah dealt harshly with her, and she fled from her. So Abraham and Sarah had had to wait 10 years since they'd had that promise from God. And you know, she was getting older, he was getting older, they couldn't see how it was going to work out. So they decided, well, maybe maybe God wants to do it through my maid Hagar. But that wasn't what God had in mind. And we see that, you know, that just caused conflict for them. Over in chapter 21, after God had fulfilled his promise, and given him the given him, given them Isaac as the true heir of the promises, in verse eight of Genesis 21. In the child Isaac grew and was weaned. And Abraham made a great feast on the day that Isaac was weaned. But Sarah, I saw the son of Hagar the Egyptian, whom she had born to Abraham laughing. So she said to Abraham, cast out this slave woman with her son, for the Son of this slave woman shall not be heir with my son, Isaac. And the thing was very displeasing to Abraham on account of his son. But God said to Abraham, be not displeased because of the boy and because of your slave woman. Whatever Sara says to you do, she tells you for through Isaac shall your offspring be named. And I will make a nation of the son of the slave woman also, because he is your offspring. So Abraham rose early in the morning and took a bread took bread and a skin of water and gave it to Hagar putting it on her shoulder, along with the child and center away, and she departed and wandered into the wilderness of Beersheba. So, these, they, they couldn't continue on dwelling together because of the, in Mateen animosity between Ishmael and Isaac in between Hagar and Sarah. And that tension, that that animosity between the descendants of Ishmael and in Abraham continue in between Ishmael and Isaac continues even to this day. So we see that they're long lasting consequences from Abraham and Sarah. Taking matters into their own hands and in not choosing not to wait on the Lord wait for his timing to fill fulfill his promises. So do we seek to follow our own wisdom to bring about God's promises? Or do we seek to understand how God wants to fulfill his promises? Let's look at a contrasting episode from scripture in Isaiah 36 and 37.

Gilbert Booher  20:27
Here, this is the time this is the time when the northern tribes of Israel had been defeated by a Syria and the Assyrians were making havoc on really wreaking havoc on the southern kingdom of Judah as well. They were taken all the fortified cities in Judah except for Jerusalem. So Jerusalem had this Jew to have this small stronghold left Jerusalem, and now the Assyrians were camped around the city, they were threatening to take it as well. And let's look to see how King Hezekiah handled this situation. Isaiah 36 verse one. In the 14th year of King Hezekiah, Sennacherib, king of Assyria, King came up against all the fortified cities of Judah and took them and the king of Assyria sent the Rabshakeh from Lankesh to King Hezekiah at Jerusalem with a great army, and he stood by the conduit of the upper pool on the highway to the washers field. skipped down to verse 13. Then the Rabshakeh stood and called out and allowed voice in the language of Judah. Here are the words of the great king, the king of Assyria, that says the king, do not let Hezekiah deceive you, for He will not be able to deliver you. Do not let Hezekiah make you trust the Lord by saying, The Lord will surely deliver us. This city will not be given into the hand of Assyria do not listen to Hezekiah for this says the king of Assyria, make your peace with me and come out to me. Then each one of you will eat of His own vine, and each one of his own fig tree. And each one of you will drink the water of his own cistern until I come and take you away to a land like your own land, a land of grain and wine, a land of bread and vineyards, beware lest Hezekiah mislead you by saying, The Lord will deliver us has any of the gods of the nations delivered his land, out of the hand of the king of Assyria were the gods of Hadith in our pod, were the gods of suffer VIIM have they delivered some airy out of my hand, who among all the gods of these lands has delivered their lands out of my hand, that the Lord should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand. So here the Rabshakeh the official of the of the Assyrians, was laying these threats upon Judah and Jerusalem. And if you just look with human eyes, his threats had a lot of backing behind them because they had run rampage over all the other peoples they had captured all these other lands. And so from a human perspective, how could you to stand to get this great army? There were 195,000 soldiers surrounding the city, how could they defeat them? But what it has a chi Do you how did he respond to this threat? Let's look in chapter verse one of chapter 37. As soon as King Hezekiah heard it, he tore his clothes and covered himself with sackcloth and went into the house of the Lord. And he sent eliaquim who was over the household and Shebna, the Secretary in the senior priests covered with sackcloth, to the prophet Isaiah the son of Amos. They said to him that says, King Hezekiah this day is a day of distress, of rebuke and of disgrace. Children have come to the point of birth, and there is no strength to bring them forth. It may be that the Lord your God will hear the words of the Rabshakeh, whom his master the king of Assyria is sent to mock the living God, and will rebuke the words that the Lord your God is heard. Therefore, lift up your prayer for the remnant that is left. When the servants of King Hezekiah came to Isaiah, Isaiah said to them, say to your master, Thus says the Lord, do not be afraid, because of the words that you have heard, with which the young men of the king of Assyria have reviled me. Behold, I will put a spirit in him so that he shall hear a rumor and return to his own land, and I will make him fall by the sword in his own land.

Gilbert Booher  25:00
We see in verse 14 Hezekiah received the letter from the hand of the messengers and read it. And Hezekiah went up to the house of the Lord and spread it before the Lord. And Hezekiah prayed to the Lord, oh Lord God of hosts, or Lord of hosts, God of Israel, enthroned above the chair of him, you are the God, you alone of all the kingdoms of the earth, you have made heaven in earth, incline your ear, oh, Lord, and here, open your eyes, oh Lord, and see and hear all the words of snacker of which he has sent to mock the living God. Truly, oh Lord, the kings of Assyria have laid waste all the nations in their lands, and if cast their gods into the fire, for they were no gods, but the work of man's man's hands, would in stone, therefore they were destroyed. So now all Lord our God, save us from his hand, that all the kingdoms of the earth may know that you alone are the Lord. So let's look down at verse 33. And see what happened. Verse 33, therefore this says, The Lord concerning the king of Assyria, he shall not come into this city, or shoot an arrow there or come before it with a shield or cast up a siege mound against it, by the way that he came, by the same shall he return, and he shall not come into this city declares the Lord. For I will defend this city to save it for my own sake, and for the sake of my servant, David, and the angel of the Lord when out and struck down 185,000 in the camp of the Assyrians. And when the people arose early in the morning, behold, these were all dead bodies. Then snacker of king of Assyria departed, in return home and lived at Nineveh. And as he was worshipping in the house of Niz, rock, his God, a drama lack and sharees, or his sons struck him down with a sword. And after they escaped into the land of Arafat, as her hadn't his son reigned in his place. So Hezekiah and his people that were, they're holed up in Jerusalem, surrounded by this army, in their own strength, they were no match for the Assyrian army. But God sent one angel in took care of the Assyrian army. God had the power to deliver. And because Hezekiah was willing to wait on the Lord and trust in Him. He received that deliverance. So next, let's think about why must we wait? Why is it that we have to wait, why can't we have things when we want it? I think that's especially a challenge for our age, because we're so used to instant gratification, our society values, instant results, instant feedback, instant gratification, and that's what they promote. And we become accustomed to that. And so it may be harder for us than some and other generations to wait. Why must we wait? Well, in Second Peter three, verse eight, we're reminded, God doesn't see time the same way we do. But do not overlook this one fact, beloved, that with the Lord one day is as 1000 years, and 1000 years as one day, to God. 1000 years is no more than a day, because he's not limited. By time the way we are, he can see everything at once. And so he can see how things work out over time, he can see his promises, how they're going to be fulfilled, we have a detailed knowledge of only a tiny slice of time in space. And so therefore, sometimes when we look at things, it doesn't make sense to us, because we can't see the whole picture. But God has complete knowledge of all time in all places. He sees how everything fits together, and how it will work out over time. So we have to trust Him, we have to be willing to wait on him. Why else must we wait? Waiting on the Lord test our faithfulness? in First Samuel 13. Remember, Saul was king of Israel this time, and he was challenged to wait for Samuel to come and offer sacrifice. But was Saul willing to wait? No, he was not. For Samuel 13.

Gilbert Booher  29:43
He saw that the people were starting to scatter from him. He was afraid to go into battle against the Philistines without offering sacrifices. And so he decided to take matters into his own On a hands in first Samia 13 Verse eight, he waited seven days the time appointed by Samuel. But Samuel did not come to Gilgal. And the people were scattering from him. So Saul said, bring the burn offerings here to me and the peace offerings, and he offered the burn offerings. As soon as he had finished offering the burn offering, behold, Samuel came and saw went out to meet him and greet him. Samuel said, What have you done? And Saul said, when I saw that the people were scattering from me and that you did not come within the days appointed, and that the Philistines had mustered it make mash. I said, Now the Philistines will come down against me at Gilgal. And I have not sought the favor for the move for not salt the favor of the Lord. So I forced myself and offered the burn offering. In Samuel said to Saul, you have done foolishly. You have not kept the command of the Lord your God with which he commanded you. For then the Lord would have established your kingdom over Israel forever. But now your kingdom shall not continue. The Lord is sought out a man after his own heart, and the Lord has commanded him to be Prince over His people, because you have not kept what the Lord commanded you. So here we see a clear contrast between Saul and David saw he waited seven days but then he didn't see Samuel coming. He wasn't willing to wait any longer he took matters into his own hands, and disobeyed the Lord. David was pursued by Saul for many years. And when he had the opportunity to kill Saul, he didn't take matters into his own hands. He was willing to wait on the Lord, trust him to provide deliverance. waiting on the Lord also provides time and occasion for us to gain strength from the Lord. Isaiah chapter 40. reminds us of this. The people of Israel the Israelites wondered if God really knew what was going on with them. They felt like maybe God didn't see God didn't understand what was happening to them. Let's listen to that the words of Isaiah in response to them, starting in chapter 40, verse 27. Why do you say Oh, Jacob and speak Oh, Israel, my way is hidden from the Lord, and my ride is disregarded by my God. Have you not home known Have you not heard? The Lord is the everlasting God, the Creator of the ends of the earth. He does not faint or grow weary. His understanding is unsearchable. He gives power to the faint, and to him who has no might, he increases strength. Even us shall faint and be weary and young men shall fall exhausted. But they who wait for the Lord shall renew their strength. They shall mount up with wings like eagles, They shall run and not be weary, they shall walk and not faint. Waiting provides time and occasion for us to gain strength from the Lord. God is able to handle the problems that we face the challenges that we endure. He is the Creator of all things. He knows everything about our world. He knows exactly what is needed for situation. He knows how many atoms of dirt are in those piles out in the parking lot. He knows all about this Coronavirus that has so interrupted our lives. God can handle it if we trust in Him. And if we take this time of waiting to gain that strength to depend upon him and learn from him, then we will be better equipped to serve Him in the future. So think about this extra time that we've had, you know, with the shutdown over the past year with with the pace of life slowing? Have we use that extra time at home to grow stronger in our faith? Have we found extra time to spend in prayer and studying God's word? Are we stronger now than a year ago? Due to waiting on the Lord? Many of you have said that you know there have been blessings in this time with the slow down it's given us more time to spend time studying God's word to spend time with our families to be able to take a break a breath from the hectic pace that so often in golf our lives have we use this time for self evaluation to look at our relationship with God and how we can draw closer to Him.

Gilbert Booher  35:15
As you know, things begin maybe to open back up and life begins to resume more normalcy. Let's not lose fat, lose sight of the blessings that have come with that extra time we've had. So what are a few benefits that we can learn gain from waiting on the Lord? Well, we can receive God's deliverance. Solve Psalm 25 reminds us of this so I'm 25 Verse one to you oh Lord, I lift up my soul. Oh God in you I trust let me not be put to shame. Let not my enemies exalt over me. Indeed none who wait for you shall be put to shame. They shall be ashamed who are wantonly treacherous. Made me to know your ways the Lord teach me your paths. Lead me in your truth and teach me for you are the God of my salvation for you I wait all the day long. God can provide the deliverance and salvation that we need. That in verse 21, may integrity and uprightness preserve me for I wait for you. Verse 20, said Oh, guard my soul and deliver me Let not me let me not be put to shame. For I take refuge in you so God can guard us from danger. Psalm 40 verse one. The Psalmist cried out to the Lord for deliverance. I waited patiently for the Lord he inquire he inclined to me and heard my cry. When we wait for the Lord God will hear our prayers. He will listen to us. And he can prevent us from worry as we cast our cares upon Him. Help us deal with that. We can receive goodness from the Lord, Psalm 27, that we saw earlier, verses 13 and 14. I believe that I shall look upon the goodness of the Lord in the land of the living. Wait for the Lord, be strong and let your heart take courage. Yes, wait for the Lord. God will provide goodness to us He will make all things even the difficult things that the trial the trials and struggles that we face, he can make those workout for our good. And we can be exalted and receive strength. As we read about we can mount up with wings, like eagles, we can soar. We can run and not grow weary. We can walk and not faint. God can provide great benefits to us. So what do we do while we're waiting? We trust in the Lord trust him to know what's best. Abraham had a real strong test of his trust. When he was commanded to sacrifice his son Isaac. He had waited these 25 years to finally receive the promise, son. And then now as Isaac grows up, God commands him to offer him as a sacrifice that made no sense to Abraham. But yet, he did what God said. He took Abraham and took Isaac his son to the mountain that God commanded him. He took him up there laid him on the altar that he had made to give him as a sacrifice. He even took the knife in his hand and was prepared to slay his son as God commanded him. Because he trusted that God if if need be, could raise him from the dead, to still fulfill his promises. Abraham trusted fully so we too need to trust that the Lord knows what is best. Be willing to follow His Teachings even if it doesn't make complete sense to us. We pray for wisdom as James instructs us. God can provide the wisdom and if we seek it earnestly, he will help us know we meditate on is God's word, so that we can learn how to apply his word to our situation. And then we do the good works. God is prepared for us that we read about in Scripture. When we see those opportunities before us. Let's take advantage of them and do the good we can Remember to manage our schedule

Gilbert Booher  40:02
so that we do have time make time to reflect on our situations and seek to know God's will seek study His Word and ask Him in prayer for guidance. And then we are ready to act. When God opens the door for us that's in keeping with his will for holiness. So we need to pray that God will give us wisdom to see what he would have us to do. Give us strength and courage to boldly seek His will. Don't give into Satan's temptations to despair and give up. But let's persevere in seeking what is good in us are waiting periods as time for growth. God can turn our waiting into much blessing. But that only happens if we have that relationship with God. So today, are you in covenant relationship with God? Are you his child? Are you striving to serve him? If not, we can help you. If you understand that Jesus is God's Son who came to give Himself as a sacrifice for our sins, if you're willing to accept the benefits of his sacrifice, it really to repent of your sins, turn away from following your own will and seek to follow his will. If you're willing to confess your faith in the Lord and be united with Him in baptism, where you gain access to the saving benefits of His death on the cross. We can help you do that this morning. Or if you've done that in the past, but you've lost sight of your relationship with with Lord, You've been trusting in your own wisdom rather than leaning upon him. You want to recommit your life to Him. We can help you in any way once you come forward as we stand together and sing this song
