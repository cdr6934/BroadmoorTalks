It is always such a great privilege and blessing and honor to assemble together and worship. And praise our great and awesome God. We say that often, but it's a uplifting experience for all of us appreciate the songs that we lead this morning, the Scripture, reading devas, thoughts at the Lord's table, reminding ourselves of the magnitude of the sacrifice made for you and me. It staggers the imagination to think about some of these Old Testament sacrifices that we looked at this morning. But understand that Jesus singular sacrifice on the cross was more powerful than every any sacrifice ever made throughout history. So we're so grateful for that. And it gives us an opportunity to come here and worship our great loss from God. Appreciate Isaac reading that passage for me this morning, although I realize I hope I didn't mess up anybody as we plan for our worship from that song. But as we think about 2020 is coming to an end. It's we're near the end of this year, it may be you breathe a sigh of relief for all the struggles and testing and difficulties of sickness, and certainly some people have lost their lives. But what has this year taught us from 2020? What what have we learned from all of this? Well, first of all, we're still here. And so we have overcome so many of the challenges that we faced a social distancing, and all that type of thing. But I would remind each of us that the first century Christians also faced enormous challenges in their lives, mainly suffering and persecution. In Revelation chapter 12, and verse 11, we see a snapshot picture of the faith and determination of the early Christians who suffered tremendously for their faith in some of them even died for their faith. And so one of the messages in this passage that Isaac read for us was that of the martyr spirit of our brothers and sisters, who, who shed their lives, for the cause of Christ. And so as we come to the end of this year, let's go to the end of the Bible, which is the book of Revelation and notice the message here, and it is one of the victory and triumph for every follower of Christ. In fact, William Henry Hendricks entitled, his commentary on the book of Revelation, more than conquerors. Now, I suggest to each one of us that we are more than conquerors. And so I titled my lesson we shall overcome. And so again, as we bring this lesson this year to a close, what

Mike Roy  02:42
better way to end the year, then with this emphatic declaration of our faith and determination to overcome this world. So even in the title of the lesson, I'm trying to communicate a truth in the power of a truth. And this is reflective of what I'm sometimes called the power of positive affirmation. When you say we shall overcome that changes your mindset, it changes your attitude, no matter what suffering and difficulties in loneliness, whatever is going on in your life. When we say this, and believe this, and this is the message that resonates from the book of Revelation, we shall overcome, then it changes our attitude towards the struggles that we face. So again, what we're doing this morning is declaring emphatically our faith in God, our trust in Him, and our determination to overcome the world that we live in. And so notice the text, that least part of the text that Isaac grid for us this morning, and verse 10. And this is describing as the struggling heaven between good and evil between Satan and his adversaries and God. He says, I heard a loud voice in heaven, saying, now the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God, and the authority of his Christ have come down for the accuser of our brothers has been thrown down, he who accuses them day and night before our God, look at verse 11. This is really the text of my lesson. So you can have your Bibles open, you can stay there. We can look at it on the screen this morning. And it says, They conquered him, Thomas Satan, that these first century Christians conquered him, by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony. It says, For the love not their lives even unto death. So Revelation, chapter 12, verse 11, is a great scripture to to focus our lives on as we seek to overcome the trials, the adversity, the sickness, the persecution, temptations, whatever we are facing, it doesn't matter. But when we believe the truth of God's word, empowers us in that enables us to overcome the world that we're living in. And so in this picture, Guinness is a picture of a war in heaven. It's a spiritual message. Michael and his angels are fighting against the dragon and his and his angels. The dragon is thrown down there. So Satan is defeated in this picture. He is described as the devil, or the serpent of old, he deceives the whole world. But you notice in here, several things, to focus on his back up for one second. And in verse 11, says that they they conquered him before we go into the question of how did these early Christians overcome Satan? Well, we see the three things by the blood of the Lamb, by the word of their testimony, and that they love not their lives, even to death. But the first point I want us not to miss, don't miss this point, they overcame Satan. That's no small victory. And Satan is no small adversary. So the point I'm making here is we come to the end of a very difficult year, in a lot of ways, these first century Christians overcame the prince of hell. And we can do it as well if we have the same kind of determination that they have. And so the devil, in this context is described as one who deceives the whole world. Satan is a deceiver, he's a liar. He's been lying. That's his nature, and he lies about us to God. In fact,

Mike Roy  06:22
he's a he's called the accuser of the brethren. So what does Satan do? Spiritually speaking in this battle between good and evil, he accuses us before God. And he did he was doing that. And then first century Christians here, what does he What does he accuse us before God with maybe insincerity? Or maybe serving God for improper motives? Or hypocrisy? And how many times maybe do we feel that we we buy into some of Satan's lies, we think I'm no good. Or I can't do much of anything. I'm not worth much. That's how those are all lies. And in again, a way to illustrate this, we put someone's name in the IRS. And he'll say something like John is only serving you, because you built a hedge around him. Well, let's assess the charge that Satan made against job so so Satan is the accuser of our brethren, and Avast, but he is he is ultimately going to be defeated. And the point that I make over here is that these Christians in the first century, did not succumb to Satan's lies. Again, Satan is the father of lies. Whenever he speaks, he speaks of his own nature, because he is a liar. And the problem is too many times we LISTEN to Him and not to Jesus, we listen to him and not to God in heaven. And we tell ourselves all these lives, I'm worthless. I can't do much. I'm a failure. That's not true. We all struggle, we all stumble in some ways. But I say this, because we don't want to miss this point, that they overcame Satan. And how did they do? So that's the question. As we look into this lesson, I want you to notice the questions How did they overcome Satan? Well, look at the text over here first, it says, by the blood of the Lamb. So if again, if you're thinking about that passage in verse 11, that they overcame him because of the because of the blood of the Lamb. And we raised the question what, what does it mean that they overcame Satan, they overcame Satan's lies, and all of his hosts that also spew out these lies. They, they overcame the devil by the blood of the Lamb. Sometimes we sing the song, What can wash away my sins, Nothing but the blood of Jesus, obviously, that implies we have faith in God, and faith in the blood of Christ. But we're talking about the power of the blood of Christ. His brother tam was talking about this morning, the power of the sacrifice of with with 1000s of animals whose blood was shed, as a means of atonement for the sins of these people in the Old Testament, but we we recognize the power of the blood of Christ, it washes away all sins, every sin that any human being can be guilty of. And so that's

Mike Roy  09:23
the first thing that said about these first century Christians, that they overcame Satan, by the blood of the Lamb. Another way of thinking about that is that if somebody suggested that these Christians were inspired by Jesus willingness to shed his blood on their behalf, and they likewise were willing to shed their blood on his behalf, when you realize that Jesus went to the cross and poured out his blood for you, and for me, that empowers me to stand up the persecution and take a sword for the cause of Christ. That's what they did. So they overcame Satan by the blood of the Lamb. And secondly, they overcame him by the word of their testimony. This, most translations say something like that, that they overcame him because the blood of the Lamb, and because of the word of the testimony, one translation says, By the truth which they proclaimed, and what I think John is telling us over here is that these early Christians testified to the truth of the gospel, and they were unwilling to recant their faith, even when facing extreme suffering and death. So when it says that they, these Christians overcame Satan, because of the word that they testify that the Gospel is true that God is true that Jesus is bigger than I'm forgiven of my sins. And they testified to that truth. And they didn't move away from the truth, they held on to the truth, they held on to their faith. And I think that's what he's saying over here. They, in fact, they in essence, resisted the devil, again reminded in James chapter four, number seven, this the promise that God gives us the Scripture, resist the devil, and he will flee from you know what the problem is, with that particular statement, that too many of us don't believe it, or somebody else can resist the devil, or brother norm can resist, but I'm not sure I can do that. The truth is, so that's a principle that's a truth that applies to each one of us. And so that's what these Christians did. In fact, when you look at the message to the churches of Asian mind, we'll be looking at that in just a moment that the church at via Tyra was told that nevertheless, hold fast. But you have until it comes to what these Christians did, to overcome their temptations, their persecution, their hardship, all that kind of thing is that they held fast. They weren't but they wouldn't budge, they wouldn't move, and Satan and all the enemies that he used to persecute these first century Christians couldn't move them off scripture, they said, I would rather die than give up my faith. That's how they lived. And we have the same have the same attitude, I'd rather die than to dump deny my faith in God. And that's the mindset that these Christians had the church in Philadelphia, Jesus said, I have set before you an open door, because you have kept my word and did not and have not denied My name. So if you look at the messages to the churches of Asia Minor, we'll be focusing on that, for the remainder of the lesson this morning, and just a few minutes, we realize that these Christians, at least many of them, by and large, were characterized by people who did not quit. They didn't give out they didn't give into fear or intimidation. They weren't even intimidated by a sword. And they were many of them were martyrs. They poured out their blood, the same way that Jesus did. And so remarkable example of courage and faith and, and faithfulness in the midst of trial. So how did they overcome Satan in all of his life, the by the blood of the Lamb, by the word of their testimony, and it said that they didn't love their lives to the point of death. Again, here's a phrase and here's a truth that we can't read past too quickly. So what I want again, I'm suggesting to us this morning that our first century brothers and sisters in Christ, were willing to both suffer and die for their faith, many of them ended up being martyrs. They were killed for the cause of Christ. But the and I guess the paradox is, they overcame Satan, even at the point of death, because they were not going to lose eternally, but they're going to they're going to hold the ground. And they overcame that great deceiver, who was that lot? Who was the liar? They overcame false teaching, they overcame persecution, they overcame personal temptations. So these first century, brothers and sisters in Christ overcame the world.

Mike Roy  14:09
And many because they were willing to even die for the for the cause of Christ. And so it's a reminder, as we think about how we will overcome the world, it'd be obviously the same way that they did but but this truth here in verse 11, is a is a sobering statement that each of us have to look at. We see that they didn't love their life, even when faced with death. I think one of the most penetrating penetrating questions that each of us have to ask as New Testament Christians is this question. Am I willing to die for Christ? Am I willing to die for my faith? That's a question that each of us have to ask and really the only way we can live courageously and faithfully God's sight in God's sight is to be willing to take a sword to take a bullet for Jesus, you're going to die sooner or later. unless Jesus returns, I'm going to die sooner or later. But what better way to die then serving God faithfully and not buckling under fear? And so, again, you you look at these first century Christians, and not everybody, every Christian died for their faith, but a lot of them did. But the other questions that we have to ask, likewise, is the question, Am I willing to suffer from my faith? Am I willing to be tortured? For my faith? What would I do in that situation if somebody tortured me, for my faith, and so again, these Christians demit did not cave into fear. They were reminded of the passage in Matthew chapter 10, verse 28, when Jesus said, do not fear those who kill the body, but are unable to kill the soul, rather fear him who is able to destroy both body and soul in hell. And so brethren, we must fear God, more than we fear people, we have to fear God's, if sufficiently in reverence him. And so our first century brothers and sisters, were willing to suffer and die for the cause of Christ, they overcame Satan. And so ultimately, even in the act of death, even in the act of suffering, and persecution, and even being put to death, they overcame him because they did not give up their faith. And they they serve God faithfully, they serve Jesus Christ faithfully to the point of their death. Now, I want to suggest to you as we make a little shift, so we've been focusing on Revelation Chapter 12, and verse 11, for the rest of the lesson this morning on a quickly and I've got the scriptures on the screen. Look at the consistent message to every one of the churches of Asia Minor, they were all told the same thing in the midst of all the struggles, and temptations and trials and disappointments and hardship, and even even the threat of death, that they were all told to overcome, whatever challenges that they were facing. So again, look at that, and how this ties in with what I'm talking about this morning. In terms of a a resolution, we shall overcome, no matter what we we had to deal with a lot of things this year. But this was not the first virus to come into the humanities. realm, it may not be the last one, we remind ourselves that God is bigger, and his promises are more powerful. But as you look at each of the messages to these churches, think about how consistently they're told to overcome these struggles. So that's the church of Ephesus. Remember, this church left their first love. Again, Jesus messages, it

Mike Roy  17:53
is churches yet you this, you do have that you hate the deeds of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate. They're in a struggle with false teaching. We have false teaching. today. It's all around us. We don't like to talk about that. That's not politically correct. And sometimes brethren, get upset if the preachers or elders talk about false teaching, but false teaching is a real threat to your soul. That's why we warn each of us to be on our guard. So to their credit, the Christians in the church of Ephesus hated the deeds of the Nicolaitans, which I also hate. He who has an ear, excuse me, let them hear what the Spirit says to the churches. To him who overcomes. So could these Christians overcome the false teaching of the Nicolay attends? Certainly. And they did. He said to him who overcomes our grant eat of the Tree of Life, which isn't a paradise of God. If you look at these promises, look at the warnings, the threats that that Jesus gives to the churches and the promises. What we understand is that God wants us to overcome. God wants us to feast on the tree of life in the paradise of God. And so it reminds us that it's worth it to overcome the struggles and the difficulties that we face in our lives. The church at Smyrna, again, remind, remember that they were facing strong persecution. It says that much of that came from Jews who were a quote synagogue of Satan. So you think we have adversity we think we have persecution in our lives. In verse 10, the message is, do not fear what you're about to suffer. Behold, the devil is about to cast some of you into prison, so that you will be tested and you will have tribulation for 10 days. Be faithful unto death until death, and I will give you the crown of life. One thing I want to say here, so when he says, Be faithful unto death, he's not saying Be faithful until you your life expires at 85 or 90 years old. And then you go on to glory. He's saying Be faithful to the point of someone taking your life with a sword, or with a bullet or whatever it might be, be faithful unto death, and I will give you the kind of life. And then again the message he who overcomes, He who overcomes will not be hurt by the second death, that's the real thing to be afraid of death away from God eternity in hell. And so again, the message is the same to the church, it's smarter. He who overcomes the message to the church at Pergamum. Again, this just as a group facing trials and persecution, it mentioned that they dwelt near Satan's throne was some with them with teaching the, the doctrine of balem or the Nicolaitans. And so again, in verse 15, you have some of those who hold the teaching in the Nicolaitans, therefore, repent, I'm coming to you quickly, I'll make war with them and get with the sword of my mouth. He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches To him who overcomes. So with these Christians not facing serious persecution was horrific persecution, and all types of false false doctrine and false teaching that they were coming across. Again, the message is the same To him who overcomes I'll give him some of the hidden manner. And I'll give him a Whitestone in a new name written on the stone which no one knows, but he who receives it. So what God is saying what Jesus is saying, to struggling Christians, he said, you persevere, you overcome, I'm going to give you food from heaven, and satisfaction from heaven. And I'm going to give you a Whitestone with a special name, which basically God is saying, Jesus is saying, This is my son, or my daughter, who is serving me faithfully. And so in the midst of their tremendous persecutions, the message is the same. To him who overcomes the church at via Tyra is one who tolerated Jezebel, she encouraged others to commit fornication is one thing to keep ourselves pure. And to avoid adultery or avoid fornication, we certainly have to do that. It's another thing to have somebody kind of close to number in their midst, who's encouraging Christians to commit fornication. It's hard for us to fathom that. And so the messages but I say to you, the rest who are in my attire, who did not hold this teaching, it have not known the deep things of Satan, as they call them, I placed no other burden on you. Nevertheless, what you have hold fast until I come, He who overcomes,

Mike Roy  22:39
again, the message the same in the midst of incredible temptation and trials of the message of the same He who overcomes who keeps my BS into the so here's a definition in some ways of what it means to overcome. We overcome the devil we can overcome his lies when we hold fast to the Word of God. Sometimes people think that this is old fashioned teaching is not it's just biblical teaching. And that's why we stress that today he who overcomes and he who keeps my beads until the end to him will give authority over the nations he shall rule them with a rod of iron as the vessels of the potter broken and pieces is I've also received authority from my father, and I will give him the morning star. So what Jesus is telling this church facing all types of temptation and false teaching, you hold fast, and overcome all these things, and you will rule with me for eternity. And I'm going to give you the morning stars can another way of saying I'm going to give you incredible honor, and because of your determination to overcome the world, the church at artists at Sardis don't forget they were told to wake up they were about to die spiritually to the point I'm, I stressed this because sometimes we think that that our temptations, our trials or persecution that we face are so great and and, and we can't relate to these Christians or maybe it wasn't as bad as it was. But the church had thought it Sardis was about to die spiritually. They told to wake up remember what you've received in hurting keep it to repent, therefore, if you do not wake up, it will come like a thief and you will not know at what hour I will come to you. But you have a few people in Sardis who have not soiled their garments, and they shall walk with me and why for they are worthy. He said He who overcomes will thus be clothed in white garments. And that's a throwback to Verse four and they will walk with me and why. He said I will not erase his name from the book of life and I'll confess his name before My Father and before His angels. This promises given to a church to a group of Christians who are about to die spiritually. Sometimes you think I can't take it anymore. I can't keep fighting temptation. I can't keep fighting discouragement or loneliness or hardship. Yes, you can just keep on keeping a hole fast to the Word of God. So again, in every situation, these Christians are facing remarkable temptation, incredible persecution and suffering. And the message is always the same. He who conquers He who is victorious will inherit all these things. Couple more to look at Philadelphia. This is actually the only church of Asia Minor where nothing negative is spoken against them, but they're suffering in terms of persecution. So because you've kept the word by perseverance, I will also keep you from the hour of testing, that our which is about to come upon the whole world to test. To test those who dwell on the earth, I'm coming quickly hold fast, but you have so that no one will take your crown. Verse 12, says he who overcomes, he said, I will make him a pillar in the temple of my God, he will not go out from it anymore. I'll write on him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, the New Jerusalem was comes down to heaven, out of heaven from my God. And again, one of the rewards here, I will give him my new name, what God is saying what Jesus is saying, to struggling Christians in a first century, John, or Susie, or Fred or Ralph or whoever it might be. This is my daughter, who served me faithfully in her life. This is my son, who stood through the test of of of trial or persecution, or temptation, And they overcame. So again, in the message is one of permanence insecurity in God's house. And the last church that we want to look at quickly, is the message to the church at Laodicea. You might remind, we might remember that in Jesus assessment of them, they were neither hot nor cold, but rather than will stay was luke warm. And Jesus said, I'm about to spit you out of my mouth.

Mike Roy  27:13
This is serious. These Christians are about to lose their souls. They are spiritually indifferent. It's one thing if they're hot, you know, that's great. Or, if they're cold, you might wake them up, but they don't even care. They don't even care about the spiritual things. They're about to die spiritually. And so the message Jesus gives them I advise you to buy from Me gold, refined by fire, so that you may become rich and white garments, that you may clothe yourself, and that the shame of uniqueness will not be revealed and I sale sab to anoint your eyes so that you may see those whom I love, I reprove and discipline therefore be zealous and repent. He said, Behold, I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears My voice and opens the door, I will come in to him, and will dine with him and he with Me just understand one thing, this is Jesus invitation to struggling, fallen Christians. This is not God's invitation to say to save what we sometimes call alien sinners. This is not a cinders prayer. These are Christians who are about to give up their faith. And Jesus says, Come back to me as baptized believers, and I'll sit with you and you can dine with me. So again, understand that the gravity of the situation that many of these Christians were at the point of giving up their faith. And what is the message of verse 21? For the seventh time, maybe message of perfection and complete, He who overcomes could these Christians delay Allah see overcome the devil? Of course they could do they believe they could maybe some of them didn't. It was a real struggle. It was a life and death struggle spiritually for these Christians, but the message is the same. He who overcomes I look at the reward. You probably read this and I've spoken on this through the years the number of times in different contexts or different messages or classes or sermons, who he who overcomes these Christians are about to to lose their faith says our grant to him to sit down with me on my throne. You got to think about that for just a minute. That Jesus is inviting lukewarm, indifferent Christians who are about to lose their souls if they repent and come back to him. Jesus is about to take these Christians who are about ready to turn their back on God and allow them to sit next to Jesus in eternal glory.

Mike Roy  30:00
That's hard to fathom. But he gives them encouragement to you, what struggle are you dealing with? What difficulty Am I facing? What temptation is so difficult that we can't firm up our faith and say, No, I'm not going to live that way, I'm not going to give it the sin. I'm not going to give it to worldliness, I'm not going to give it to fear. Again, this year has been a challenge in so many ways. But we remind ourselves that God is bigger than our challenges. And we are overcomers. So we've been looking this morning at this text, and every message to every church was the same. He who conquers, He who overcomes will inherit all these things. That's a reminder that in our DNA, that God made us as overcomers, we can choose to overcome or we can choose to give in to fear can give into failure and given to sin and give into temptation, we can choose that. But life is a choice. I've been saying that for a long time, too. But overcoming is also a choice. You make that choice to overcome, or you make the choice to give up or to give in and say it's not worth it, and view of all the rewards a Goddess has in store for us who would want to make that choice. Certainly no one should make that choice. So again, to the message to each church to every Christian for these churches in Asia, mine is the same to him who conquers, this could be incredible reward. And so again, it's just a simple reminder, brethren, that we are overcomers that's how God designed us. There's two more verses I want to look at before we extend the invitation. So this message is throughout the New Testament and John's epistle and First John chapter four. He says, By this you know, the Spirit of God, every spirit that confess that Jesus Christ has come in the flesh is from God. And every spirit that does not confess Jesus is not from God. This is the spirit of the Antichrist, which you have heard was coming and now is in the world. So these Christians that John's writing to, uh, facing tremendous false teaching, the devil is trying to bring these Christians down to little children, you are from God, and have overcome them. You are from God, little children, you've overcome them, because greater is He who is in you than he who is in the world. So it's a reminder that as we allow the truth of God's word to permeate our hearts, that God lives in us that Jesus Christ lives in me, and the strength that I have to serve Him, and to overcome my trials and difficulties and temptations. And because the living God lives in me, again, through His Word, through His love, through his teaching, and through worship, we experience God's presence. So the message is the same. You are from God and have overcome them because he who is in you is greater than he who is in the world, one of the verse that we want to look at before we extend the invitation song, against the same pistol. For this is the love of God that we keep His commands we sang about that this morning, bless it loves who do His commandments, who keep God's Word. For this is the love of God that we keep his commandments in his commandments and not burdensome. For everyone who has been born of God overcomes we're how do we overcome the world by being born of God. That means we get to be reborn. If we be born of water in the Spirit through faith and repentance and baptism. He says, For everyone who has been born of God overcomes the world, there's nobody here who should lose your salvation. Nobody. If you've obeyed the gospel of Christ, if you haven't obeyed the god for Christ, you need to do that right away. But if we'd been born of God, you overcome the world. And you said, this is the victory that has overcome the world. What's the victory? CZ, to talk about this, our faith? Is faith. Ultimately, do you believe the Word of God? Or do you not believe it? That's the question for you for you and I do you believe God's word, are you? Do you not believe it? Do you listen to Satan? Or do you listen to Jesus? Who are you listening to? That that that is the challenge for so I hope the lesson will be encouraging. For each of us. We've again, no way to kind of wrap our arms around what we've experienced this past year. And then the recent explosion in downtown Nashville a bomb basically

Mike Roy  34:40
all kinds of challenges, but we are overcomers with the way that we overcome. And actually the question I would ask us, how do we overcome the world and Satan lies Well, the same way that these first century Christians do by the blood of Christ by the word of our testimony. by being willing to not love our lives to the point of death, and so the message and Revelation should give us great encouragement to keep on keeping on and to overcome the world that we and the struggles that we face in this life to somebody this morning that has not been born of God, then we urge you to do that through faith and repentance baptism. That's how you get into Christ, baby that you face trials and temptations you do and I do and we all be might need the praise of this congregation. If we can encourage you in any way you We invite you to comments while we stand and sing this invitation song
