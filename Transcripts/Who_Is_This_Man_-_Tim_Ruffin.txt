idols we're going to get started in John chapter one. John chapter one is where we will begin this evening. And once you find John chapter one, if you want to place a marker in John chapter five, that is where we will spend most of our time together this evening. As I look in the audience, I'm struck by brother tant sitting in front of me, he doesn't know me, but I know who he is. So it's a good surprise to see him. I've heard many good things about you through the years. And glad you're here. Glad you're here. I'm thankful to be with you all this evening, I have been eagerly anticipating my time with you for quite some time. And I'm so glad that it has finally arrived. I really appreciate the invitation. I was here a few years ago. And I had a wonderful experience then. And I'm thankful and excited to be back with you all, this evening to share. In this series, I have been able to look over the list of topics that you all have been studying this summer, and I have seen the list of speakers. And I'm certain that you all have had a fruitful study this summer. So again, thank you all so much for the invitation. It's good to be with you all. It's good to see you all. I'm excited about studying the Word of God with you all we're going to begin in John chapter one.

Unknown Speaker  01:45
In John, chapter one and verse number one, the Bible says, In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God, all things were made through Him, and without Him was not anything made that was made in Him was life, and the life was the light of men. And the light shines in the darkness, and the darkness has not overcome it. John drops down in verse 14, and he says, And the Word became flesh, and dwelt among us. And we have seen or we have beheld his glory, glory, as of the only Son, from the Father, full of grace and truth. This evening, as we consider the Gospel of John, the question that we ask ourselves is, Who is this man? Who is this man that John speaks of in his prologue? Who is this man who Scripture describes as the word of God? Who is it? Who is this man who is said to have been with God, the Father and God, the Spirit from the very beginning of time? Who in the world is he who is this man who is described as the creator, the creator of all of the ends of the earth? Scripture says that nothing, absolutely nothing on this side of heaven, or in eternity was made without him. Who is he? Who is this man who scripture says, is light and life Who is the one who scripture says, stripped himself of his majesty, he stripped himself of his majesty, he left heaven, he came to this earth, He came to this place, and the Bible tells us that he was dripping with grace and truth. Who in the world is he? In John, chapter five, we will soon see that the Jewish religious leaders asked this same question. In John chapter five, we're introduced to a man we were introduced to a man who had a problem he was a paralytic, he wasn't able to walk. He wasn't able to walk for about 38 years and in the passage, we learned that he has a miraculous encounter he is suddenly healed and the Jewish religious leaders are upset by the fact that he was healed on the Sabbath day. And in John chapter five and verse 11, the man who was formerly lame responds to the Jewish religious leaders and he said is the man who healed me. That man said to me, take up your bed and walk. The man who healed me. That man said to me, take up your bed and walk. And in John chapter five and verse 12, the Jewish religious leaders respond to him and say, Who is this man? Who in the world is this man? Who was it? Who was it? Who healed you? Who was it? Who made you? Well, who was it? Who told you to arrive? Who was it? Who told you to get up? Who was it? Who told you to grab your bed? Who was it that made you walk? Who in the world was it that changed

Unknown Speaker  05:47
your life forever? This evening, as we consider the Gospel of John, and as we consider the scene, this scene in the light of this formerly paralytic man, the only logical conclusion that we can draw is, this man was none other thing Jesus Christ, the Son of God, who saw the unseen in John chapter five, John chapter five, starting in verse number one, the Bible says, After this, there was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. Now there is in Jerusalem by the sheep gate, a pool in Aramaic called Bethesda, which has five roofed colonnades in these lay a multitude of invalids, blind lame and paralyzed verse for some translations lead out the ESV leaves it out, but the New King James Version says in verse four, for an angel went down at this certain season into the pool, and stirred up the water. Then whoever stepped in first after stirring of the water, was made well of whatever disease he had. Verse five would continue to say, one man was there who had been in invalid for 38 years. When Jesus saw him lying there and knew that he had already been there a long time. He said to him, do you want to be he'll hear in this passage, we see again that the feast of the Jews had come. Jesus was heading to Jerusalem to enjoy this feast, this time of celebration. Once he arrived in Jerusalem, he is suddenly welcomed by a multitude of invalids who are all lying beside a pool. As I was studying for this lesson, I wanted to make sure that I knew exactly what an invalid was I did a Google search on the word and an invalid is someone who has been made weak or disabled by an illness or an injury. So Jesus gets into Jerusalem, and he sees all of these people. Scripture says there were there are a multitude of people, a multitude of invalids a multitude of blind a multitude of lame a multitude of paralyzed people who are lying beside this pool. The one who John Chapter Five focuses on was a man who was not able to walk for 38 years. And if you look at John chapter five and verse number 14, it would seem to imply that this man who wasn't able to walk for 38 years, was paralyzed due to some type of sin that he had committed earlier in his life. For after Jesus healed him. In verse 14, Jesus says to him, See you are well, SIN NO MORE that nothing worse may happen to you. So it seems I don't know. But it seems as though this man was paralyzed because of his sins. So again, here in John, chapter five, Jesus is surrounded by a host of people who have problems. And many of these people in this passage had these problems because of their own sins, at least the paralyzed man did. And so they were overlooked. They were ignored. There were likely unseen by most, but the remarkable thing is, Scripture says in John chapter five, that Jesus saw this man John five or six when Jesus saw him lying there, and knew that he had been already there for a long time. Jesus saw this man, and he knew facts about this man.

Unknown Speaker  10:14
Think about how fascinating that would have been. Imagine this. You're in downtown Nashville for a Nashville Predators hockey game. There are multitudes of people, hundreds and 1000s of people who are attending this hockey game. You learn that Taylor Swift, Taylor Swift is in the audience. And not only do you learn and hear that Taylor Swift is in the audience, but Taylor Swift notices you. She locks eyes with you. She pays attention to you. She sees you. How wonderful would that feel? Multiply that times 10. And this is likely how this paralyzed man felt when the Savior of the world locked eyes with him. When the Savior of the world noticed him, when the Savior of the world paid attention to him, when the Savior of the world saw him. This evening, we're asking ourselves who in the world was this man? Who was the man who John the Apostle describes in his prologue? Who is the man who healed a lame man, a man who had been lame for 38 years. Here in John chapter five, we see that it was none other than Jesus Christ, the Son of God, who saw the unseen. But not only that, as we examine this passage, we learned not only was Jesus a man who saw the unseen, but Jesus was a man who spoke to the ignored. In John chapter five, starting in verse one, the tech says again, after this, there was a feast of the Jews, and Jesus went up to Jerusalem. Now there is in Jerusalem by the sheep gate, a pool in Aramaic called Bethesda which has five roof colonnades and these lay a multitude of invalids, blind, lame and paralyzed, verse five, one man was there who had been in invalid for 38 years, when Jesus saw him lying there and knew that he had already been there a long time. He said to him, he said to him, do you want to be healed? The sick man answered him, Sir, I have no one to put me into the pool when the water is stirred up. And while I'm going another steps down before me, verse eight, Jesus said to him, Get up, take up your bed, and walk. Here in John five, we see a man who has been ignored. No one paid attention to him. No one cared about him. For 38 years, he was lame for 38 years, he couldn't walk for 38 years. He's lying beside this fool, hoping, hoping and wishing and praying perhaps, that someone would have some mercy on him, hoping wishing and praying that someone would show him some concern. Someone would show him some love, someone would lift him up off the ground, and throw him into that pool. For a very long time. The Scripture says, This man was hopeless, helpless and last for a very long time. This man was ignored for an incredibly long time. This man was unseen. And so how remarkable how remarkable. It must have been when a man who had been ignored for so many years, was finally seen by the Savior of the world. When a man was finally seen, and when a man was finally spoken to by the Savior of the world, again, think about this. You're in downtown Nashville, you're going to a Nashville Predators hockey game. There are hundreds and 1000s of people present at this hockey game. You learn that Taylor Swift is in the audience. You know, she's there. She loves eyes with you. She pays attention to you. She sees you. But not only does she see you, she speaks to you. She speaks to you. She starts a conversation with you. Jessica Davenport. How are you doing today? How would that feel? It would be an incredible feeling. multiplied that times 10. And think about how this man in John chapter five must have felt when the Savior of the world had a conversation with him. Am, Jesus asks him one simple question, do you want to be healed? Do you want to be healed? And the text says that the man responded and said, Well, I've been sitting beside this for for a long, long time. I've been sitting beside this fall for a very long time and I'm being passed by, I'm being ignored. People don't care about me.

Unknown Speaker  15:27
And then Jesus responds and says to him, rise, take up your bed and walk. This evening, we're asking ourselves the question, Who was this man? Who is this man that John the Apostle spoke of in his prologue? Who is this man who saw the unseen Who is this man who spoke to the unseen here in John chapter five, we learned that it was none other than Jesus Christ, the Son of God, Jesus Christ is a man who sees those who haven't been seen. And third, and finally, he is a man who saves those who are lost in John chapter five, starting in verse number seven, after Jesus asked this man, if you want it to be healed, the sick man answered him, Sir, I have no one to put me into the pool when the water is stirred up. And while I'm going another steps down before me, Jesus said to him, Get up, take up your bed and walk, verse nine, and at once at once the man was healed, and he took up his bed, and he walked. How fascinating is this? How remarkable is this, Jesus did the works that no one else could do. This man had been lame for 38 years, this man had been ignored for 38 years, no physician could heal him. None of these people in Jerusalem cared about him. No one wanted to help him. No one wanted to do a single thing for him. But Jesus saw him Jesus spoke to him and Jesus saved him. Here in John chapter five, we see that this man was saved in a physical way. He was laying for 38 years, and so it must have been incredibly hard for him to find food. He couldn't walk for 38 years, so it must have been very hard for him to get up and find water. He couldn't walk for 38 years, so it was probably hard for him to find shelter. He was exposed to all of the elements that come in life under the sun. A lame man, a man who couldn't move for 38 years is healed in an instant he has saved by Jesus in a physical sense. But what I find remarkable in this passage is Jesus wasn't merely concerned about healing this man physically, Jesus greatest concern was healing this man spiritually. In John chapter five. Starting in verse nine, the text says that the man was healed, and he took up his bed and he walked. Now that day was the Sabbath first 10, so that you said to the man who had been healed, it is the Sabbath, and it is not lawful for you to take up your bed. But he answered them, the man who healed me, that man said to me, take up your bed and walk. They asked him, Who is the man who said to you, take up your bed and walk. Now the man who had been healed did not know who it was for Jesus had withdrawn as there was a crowd in the place. Afterward, Jesus found this man in the marketplace. Afterward, Jesus found this man in the schoolhouse. Afterward, Jesus found this man with his family. Afterward, Jesus found this man trying to prepare for the Olympic Games. No. Here in John chapter five, the text tells us after this man was healed, after Jesus gave him the ability to walk, he was found in the temple.

Unknown Speaker  19:35
This man who was formerly lame recognize what was most important in his life. This man who was formerly lame recognize that it wasn't the physical things in this life that have the most value. Here in this passage, we see that this man who was formerly lame, loved, respected and he appreciated his god He saw the worth and the value of spinning time serving his Lord. Here in John chapter five after he was made well, Jesus found him in the temple and said to him, See, you are well, you are well not merely, not merely because you can walk, you are well because you see, you recognize and you notice that spiritual things are of utmost importance. See, you are made well, SIN NO MORE that nothing worse may happen to you. This evening, we're asking ourselves the question, Who is this man? Who is the one who Scripture describes as being the Word of God? Who is the one who Scripture describes as having been in the beginning with God the Father and God the Spirit, who is the one who is the creator of the earth, Who is the one who is full of light and light who is the one who is full of grace and truth. Here in John chapter five, we learn this man is none other than Jesus Christ, the Son of God, who saw the unseen he spoke to the ignored and he saved the loss. Today is August the third 2022. And like this man, in John chapter five, at some point in our lives, we too, are hopeless, helpless and lost. At some point in all of our lives, we are spiritual invalids. At some point in our lives, we're spiritually weak, lame, and destined for death. And we're hopeless, helpless and lost because of something that we have done. In John chapter five, it seems likely that that man was lame for 38 years because of something that he had done. We at some point in our lives are spiritually weak, because of our own sins. And Romans chapter three and verse 23, the apostle Paul reminds us that all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God. And John would tell us in First John chapter one, verse eight, if we say that we have no sin, we are a liar, and the truth is not in us. And so we know that because of our sins, we have been separated from God. Because of our sins, we are enemies of God, as Paul would describe in Romans chapter five. Because of our sins, we are susceptible to the wrath of God. At some point in all of our lives, we like this man in John chapter five, we're hopeless, helpless and last.

Unknown Speaker  23:20
But the beautiful thing is, despite our circumstances, despite our former circumstances, God loved us so much, that he sent his only begotten Son to suffer, to die and to rise so that we could have life. The beautiful thing is, God loved us so much that He sent His Son to this earth to live a life that was full of grace and truth. And we have a God, we have a father, and we have a son who sees us. He sees us, he notices us, He cares about us, and he pays attention to us. All throughout Scripture, we see how time and time and time again, our Father God has a particular interest in his children. He knows what is going on in our lives. He sees what is going on in our lives, he pays attention to us. We see this from the very beginning of time in Genesis chapter three, God places Adam and Eve in this blissful garden, he gives them everything that their hearts does whatever desire, but he had one simple rule of follow. Don't eat from the fruit of the Tree of Knowledge of Good and Evil. If you eat from the fruit of that tree, you will die. Unfortunately, Adam and Eve ate the fruit of that tree. Their eyes were opened and sin entered into this world. After their eyes were open. The text tells us that they realize that they were naked and that they were ashamed. And so Oh, they tie together these fig leaves and they hide in the bushes. The tech says that God asked Adam, where are you? God didn't ask Adam where he was because he didn't know where Adam was. God asked Adam, where are you? To motivate him to confess his sins? Because God was very aware of what Adam and Eve had done. Because God sees all and he knows on Psalm 139, King David is blown away. He's blown away by the fact that he has a God who sees everything. He is blown away by the fact that he serves a God who is intimately familiar with all of his ways. David would say, where can I go from your spirit? Where can I flee from your presence? If I ascend into heaven, you are there. If I make my bed in hell, behold, you are there. If I take the wings of the morning and I dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea, even there, your hand shall lead me in your right hand shall hold me. God knows all he sees on he is familiar with all of our ways, that can be a sobering reality, and it can be a comforting reality. It is a sobering reality to think about. We serve a God who knows about all of our faults, he knows about all of our sins, He knows about all of our shortcomings, but it's comforting to know that the same God knows when we are weak. He knows when we are tired, he knows when we are sad, he knows when we feel lonely, and he cares about us. He cares about us and Luke chapter 10, Jesus tells the story of the Good Samaritan, he tells a story about a man who had been beaten and left on the road. A priest passed by this man, a Jew passed by this man, but the one who stopped was a Samaritan, the Samaritan saw that man who has been he noticed that man who has been and he did some good for that man who was beaten. The Good Samaritan is a perfect picture of our Lord Who sees and cares about each and every one of us. Luke, chapter 15, is full of parables that tell us about how our God loves each and every one of us. He cares about that one lost soul. And it is a beautiful thing. It is a beautiful thing that at the time in our life, when we had hit rock bottom, at the time in our lives, and we were a spiritual invalid, God saw us but not only did he see us, let me back up.

Unknown Speaker  27:53
Sometimes in life, we feel like we are unnoticed, we live in a big, big world, there are about 7 billion people in this world. Sometimes we may feel overlooked by our employer, we may feel overlooked by our teacher, we may feel overlooked by our families, we may even feel overlooked by our brothers and sisters in Christ. I had the the blessing and the privilege to spend two weeks in Africa this summer. And it was a remarkable thing. To see how excited the children in Africa were over a piece of gum. Here's a picture of me handing out a stick of gum to the children. While I was passing out this gum,

Unknown Speaker  28:38
I was so worried that I would overlook one of these kids, I only had like five pieces of gum, and you see that there are more than five children who are surrounding me. And so I started breaking the gum and half handing it out. But unfortunately, I still didn't have enough gum for all of the children there in that village. I overlooked some of the children, some of the children were not seen. But thankfully we serve a God who does not overlook us. in a spiritual sense. God has enough gum for every single child that he has made. God sees all of his children. But not only does he see us, He speaks to us. In John chapter five, Jesus saw that man who was lame, and he spoke to that man who was lame. We serve a God who speaks to us today through His Word. Again, there are times in our lives when we may feel ignored. But there are also times in our lives and we were blown away by who it is that spoke to us. Several years ago, I was at the movie theaters in Franklin, Tennessee, and I'm buying my movie ticket and I run into Eddie George, the running back for the Tennessee Titans. And he spoke to me. I was blown away by the fact that someone like Eddie George Hall of Fame running back with speak to me. Just a few years after that, I was flying back from Chicago. I was in the gift shop buying some candy, and I ran into Jesse Jackson, silver rights leader, former presidential candidate, Jesse Jackson spoke to me. I had about a five minute conversation with this man. Just a few weeks ago, I was at a NASCAR race. I ran into Alvin Kamara star running back for the New Orleans Saints. He spoke to me, I was blown away by this fat. My dad, several weeks ago, ran into Michael Jordan and took a selfie with Michael Jordan, blown away by the fact that someone like Michael Jordan would speak to my father. But the incredible thing is as great as these men are, they're not nearly as fascinating as our Father God and His Son who speaks to each and every one of us. He speaks to us through His inspired Word. In Second Timothy chapter three and verse 16. The Bible tells us that all scripture is breathed out by God. God talks to us through His Word. In John chapter one and verse one, we learned that Jesus Christ is the word and the Hebrew writer would tell us in Hebrews chapter one verse one, long ago at many times, and in many ways, God spoke to our fathers by the prophets. But in these days, He speaks to us through His Son, His Son, Jesus Christ speaks through us and he tells us exactly what we must do to be holy. He tells us exactly what we must do to be pure. He tells us exactly what we must do to resist sin and temptation. He tells us exactly what we must do to be more like Him, He tells us exactly what we must do to have eternal life. And that is an incredible thing. It is something that no man can do. It is something that transcends every conversation that we have ever had, or ever will have with any single human being because Jesus was not merely man. He was the Son of God. He was the Son of God who saw us he was the Son of God who spoke to us and He is the Son of God who has saved us in John chapter five. No physician could feel that man, and John chapter five, none of those human beings had enough love to lift that man up off the ground and put him into that pool. In John chapter five. This man was overlooked and ignored for 38 years, no one can make him well, until he had an interaction with Jesus Christ, he had an interaction with Jesus Christ who saved him in his weakest moments. All of us have interactions with Jesus Christ every single day. And it's a beautiful thing to know. When we are ready to respond to His invitation. He will save us while we were still weak. Romans chapter five would say, Christ died for the ungodly. For scarcely will one die for a righteous person, though perhaps were a good person, woman even dare to die. But the text says that God has demonstrated he has shown us as love that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us. That is a wonderful thing. Christ has died for us. But not only that, he died. He rose, he rose and now he occupies the throne of God. He is head of the church, He now holds the book of life. He is King of kings. He is Lord of lords, He is the Alpha he is the Omega he is that victorious warrior who's riding on a white horse, wearing a robe that has been dipped in blood transcribed on it, King of Kings and Lord of lords. And because he has been given this title he saves to the uttermost Thanks be to God for His indescribable gift. Thanks be to God for sending His Son to this earth. Thanks be to God for allowing his son to to suffer a death on the cross. But even more than that, thanks be to God for raising his son from the grave three days later with the keys of death and hell at his fingertips. We serve a God. We serve a God who has done incredible things for his children. We serve a God who has sent His Son to this earth to see us to speak to us and to save us. If you're here this evening and you're not a Christian, this is a wonderful opportunity to become one. You do so by hearing the Word of God believing that Jesus Christ is the Son of God, having your sins washed away and baptism rising forth walk Living every single day and newness of life

Unknown Speaker  35:02
if you've done this before but you've made mistakes and you would like to make things right this evening or if you have any other spiritual need that we can help you with we ask that you please come to the front while we stand and sing the song of invitation
